Study Title: Mixed-Methods Study on Caregiver Strain, Quality of Life, and Perceived Health.

Study Summary:
Caring for someone with dementia is associated with negative and positive experiences. There is little evidence based on large datasets. To present data around the experience of caring for someone with dementia, to identify support (emotional and practical) needs, and inform future service provision. A mixed-methods study embedded in the Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) Randomized Controlled Trial. We administered questionnaires on strain, quality of life (QoL), and perceived health to 301 caregivers and assessment of cognitive performance, depression, anxiety, and disability in activities of daily living to 301 participants with dementia. Data were analyzed through descriptive and modelling statistics. A subsample of 20 patient-caregiver dyads were qualitatively interviewed. Data around caregivers' experience of providing care were extrapolated and analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. There were significant negative associations between caregiver strain and QoL (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.01) and between caregiver age and QoL (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.01), and significant positive associations between caregiver strain and disability (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.01), cognitive impairment (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.01), depression (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05), and anxiety of the person with dementia (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05). Older caregivers reported a lack of support, reinforced by their reluctance to seek help. All caregivers reported contradictory emotions associated with caring and accumulation of strain over time. While there is recognition that it is essential to support caregivers, dedicated intervention programs, and support strategies to respond to the needs of older caregivers are still needed.
