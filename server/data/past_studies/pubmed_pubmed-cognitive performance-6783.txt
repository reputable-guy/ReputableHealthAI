Study Title: Combined use of smartphone and smartband technology in the improvement of lifestyles in the adult population over 65&#x2009;years: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial (EVIDENT-Age study).

Study Summary:
The increasing use of smartphones by older adults also increases their potential for improving different aspects of health in this population. Some studies have shown promising results in the improvement of cognitive performance through lifestyle modification. All this may have a broad impact on the quality of life and carrying out daily living activities. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of combining the use of smartphone and smartband technology for 3&#x2009;months with brief counseling on life habits, as opposed to providing counseling only, in increasing physical activity and improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of the intervention on body composition, quality of life, independence in daily living activities and cognitive performance. This study is a two-arm cluster-randomized trial that will be carried out in urban health centers in Spain. We will recruit 160 people aged between 65 and 80 without cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment (score in the Mini-mental State Examination &#x2265;24). On a visit to their center, intervention group participants will be instructed to use a smartphone application for a period of 3&#x2009;months. This application integrates information on physical activity received from a fitness bracelet and self-reported information on the patient's daily nutritional composition. The primary outcome will be the change in the number of steps measured by accelerometer. Secondary variables will be adherence to the Mediterranean diet, sitting time, body composition, quality of life, independence in daily living activities and cognitive performance. All variables will be measured at baseline and on the assessment visit after 3&#x2009;months. A telephone follow-up will be carried out at 6&#x2009;months to collect self-reported data regarding physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Preventive healthy aging programs should include health education with training in nutrition and lifestyles, while stressing the importance of and enhancing physical activity; the inclusion of new technologies can facilitate these goals. The EVIDENT-AGE study will incorporate a simple, accessible intervention with potential implementation in the care of older adults. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03574480 .
