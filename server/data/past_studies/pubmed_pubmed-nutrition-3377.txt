Study Title: Meals, Education, and Gardens for In-School Adolescents: A Cluster Randomized Trial of an Adolescent Nutrition Intervention Package in Tanzania.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to implement and evaluate integrated, school-based nutrition intervention packages for adolescents in Dodoma, Tanzania. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among six secondary schools in Dodoma, Tanzania. Two schools received the full-intervention package of school meals, nutrition education, school gardens, and community workshops. Two schools received the partial-intervention package without the school meals component. Two schools served as the controls and did not receive any intervention. The intervention was implemented over one academic year. The analytical sample included 534 adolescents aged 14 to 17 at baseline and 286 parents. Outcomes included nutrition knowledge, food preferences, diet quality, food insecurity, physical activity, growth, and anemia. Linear models were used to estimate mean differences, and logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs). Compared to the control, both the partial (OR: 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35, 1.00) and full (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.59) interventions were associated with lower odds of poor diet quality among adolescents. Among the parents, both the partial (OR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.40) and full (OR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.58) interventions were associated with lower odds of poor diet quality. The partial (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.47) and full (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.72) interventions were associated with lower odds of adolescent overweight or obesity. School-based nutritional intervention packages incorporating multiple actions may improve the diet quality of adolescents and their household members and reduce the double burden of adolescent malnutrition.
