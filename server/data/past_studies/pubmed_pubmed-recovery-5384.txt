Study Title: The Effects of a 6-Week Plyometric and Sprint Interval Training Intervention on Soccer Player's Physical Performance.

Study Summary:
Despite the well-documented benefits of sprint interval training (SIT) and plyometric training (PT) in improving the physical fitness of soccer players, it remains unclear which of these training methods is superior for enhancing players' aerobic and anaerobic performance. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of SIT and PT on physical performance measures of male soccer players. Thirty male soccer players were randomly assigned to PT (n = 10), SIT (n = 10), and an active control group (CON, n = 10). Before and after the training period, participants underwent a battery of tests consisting of vertical jump, Wingate, linear sprint with and without ball dribbling, change of direction, ball kick, and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) tests. Both groups exhibited similar improvements in maximal kicking distance (PT, effect size [ES] = 0.68; SIT, ES = 0.92) and measures of aerobic fitness including maximum oxygen uptake (PT, ES = 1.24; SIT, ES = 1.26) and first (PT, ES = 0.85; SIT, ES = 1.08) and second (PT, ES = 0.86; SIT, ES = 0.98) ventilatory thresholds. However, PT intervention resulted in greater changes in vertical jump (ES = 1.72 vs. 0.82, p = 0.001), anaerobic power (peak power, ES = 1.62 vs. 0.97, p = 0.009; mean power, ES = 1.15 vs. 1.20, p = 0.05), linear speed (20-m, ES = -1.58 vs. -0.98, p = 0.038; 20-m with ball, ES = -0.93 vs. 0.71, p = 0.038), and change of direction ability (ES = -2.56 vs. -2.71, p = 0.046) than SIT. In conclusion, both PT and SIT demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing aerobic performance among male soccer players. However, PT yielded superior improvements in anaerobic power, vertical jump, linear speed, and change of direction performance compared to SIT. These findings suggest that PT may offer additional benefits beyond aerobic conditioning.
