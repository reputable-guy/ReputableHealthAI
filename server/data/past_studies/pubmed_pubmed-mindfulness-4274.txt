Study Title: Neurophysiological brain function predicts response to cognitive rehabilitation and mindfulness in multiple sclerosis: a randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Cognitive treatment response varies highly in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Identification of mechanisms is essential for predicting response. This study aimed to investigate whether brain network function predicts response to cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). PwMS with cognitive complaints completed CRT, MBCT, or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) and performed three measurements (baseline, post-treatment, 6-month follow-up). Baseline magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures were used to predict treatment effects on cognitive complaints, personalized cognitive goals, and information processing speed (IPS) using mixed models (secondary analysis REMIND-MS study). We included 105 PwMS (96 included in prediction analyses; 32 CRT, 31 MBCT, 33 ETAU), and 56 healthy controls with baseline MEG. MEG did not predict reductions in complaints. Higher connectivity predicted better goal achievement after MBCT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010) and CRT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018). Lower gamma power (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006) and higher connectivity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.020) predicted larger IPS benefits after MBCT. These MEG predictors indicated worse brain function compared to healthy controls (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Brain network function predicted better cognitive goal achievement after MBCT and CRT, and IPS improvements after MBCT. PwMS with neuronal slowing and hyperconnectivity were most prone to show treatment response, making network function a promising tool for personalized treatment recommendations. The REMIND-MS study was prospectively registered in the Dutch Trial registry (NL6285; https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NTR6459 ).
