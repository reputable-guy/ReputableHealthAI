Study Title: Effect of Kinesio taping on edema and wrist functions in patients with distal radius fracture followed conservatively with a cast: A randomized controlled single-blinded study.

Study Summary:
Data in the literature on the results of Kinesio taping (KT) application after cast removal in patients with distal radius fracture (DRF) are quite limited. It was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of KT applied immediately after cast removal in addition to the exercise program on edema, functionality, range of motion, and muscle strength in patients with conservatively followed DRF. Randomized controlled single-blinded clinical study. This study was conducted with 64 patients with a diagnosis of DRF. The patients were randomized as Kinesio taping group (KTG) and control group. Both groups received a conventional home exercise program. KT was applied to patients in KTG for 10&#xa0;days. Circumference and volume measurements were taken at baseline and day 10. Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire for Disability, Visual Analog Scale, grip strength, and wrist joint range of motion measurements were taken at baseline, day 5, and day 10. The circumference difference between the affected extremity and the healthy extremity was statistically greater in the control group on the fifth day at the wrist level (<0.001) and 6&#xa0;cm proximal to the wrist (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). The circumference difference between the affected extremity and the healthy extremity was statistically greater in the control group on the 10th day at the wrist level (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) and 6&#xa0;cm proximal to the wrist (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01). Wrist extension angle (<0.001), wrist flexion angle (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), and supination angle (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001) were higher in KTG on the 10th day. On the 10th day, the grip strength (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) was higher in the KTG, while the Visual Analog Scale value (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01), Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire for Disability score (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01), and the percentage of strength loss in the healthy arm (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01) were lower in the KTG. In patients with DRF who were treated conservatively with a cast, the inclusion of Kinesio taping (KT) in the rehabilitation program was found to be effective in reducing edema and pain, as well as improving functionality, strength, and range of motion.
