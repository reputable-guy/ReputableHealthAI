Study Title: Nicotine exacerbates exertional heat strain in trained men: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.

Study Summary:
To determine whether using nicotine exacerbates exertional heat strain through an increased metabolic heat production (H) or decreased skin blood flow (SkBF), 10 nicotine-na&#xef;ve trained males [37 &#xb1; 12 yr; peak oxygen consumption (V&#x307;o): 66 &#xb1; 10 mL&#xb7;min&#xb7;kg] completed four trials at 20&#xb0;C and 30&#xb0;C following overnight transdermal nicotine (7 mg&#xb7;24 h) and placebo use in a crossover, double-blind design. They cycled for 60 min (55% V&#x307;o) followed by a time trial (&#x223c;75% V&#x307;o) during which measures of gastrointestinal (T) and mean weighted skin ([Formula: see text]) temperatures, SkBF, H, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were made. The difference in &#x394;Tbetween nicotine and placebo trials was greater during 30&#xb0;C (0.4 &#xb1; 0.5&#xb0;C) than 20&#xb0;C (0.1 &#xb1; 0.7&#xb0;C), with [Formula: see text]higher during nicotine than placebo trials (0.5 &#xb1; 0.5&#xb0;C,= 0.02). SkBF became progressively lower during nicotine than placebo trials (= 0.01) and progressively higher during 30&#xb0;C than 20&#xb0;C trials (< 0.01); MAP increased from baseline (< 0.01) and remained elevated in all trials. The difference in Hbetween 30&#xb0;C and 20&#xb0;C trials was lower during nicotine than placebo (= 0.01) and became progressively higher during 30&#xb0;C than 20&#xb0;C trials with exercise duration (= 0.03). Mean power output during the time trial was lower during 30&#xb0;C than 20&#xb0;C trials (24 &#xb1; 25 W,= 0.02), and although no effect of nicotine was observed (> 0.59), two participants (20%) were unable to complete their 30&#xb0;C nicotine trials as one reached the ethical limit for T(40.0&#xb0;C), whereas the other withdrew due to "nausea and chills" (T= 39.7&#xb0;C). These results demonstrate that nicotine use increases thermal strain and risk of exertional heat exhaustion by reducing SkBF.In na&#xef;ve participants, acute nicotine use exerts a hyperthermic effect that increases the risk of heat exhaustion during exertional heat strain, which is driven by a blunted skin blood flow response. This has implications for) populations that face exertional heat strain and demonstrate high nicotine use (e.g., athletes and military, 25%-50%) and) study design whereby screening and exclusion for nicotine use or standardization of prior use (e.g., overnight abstinence) is encouraged.
