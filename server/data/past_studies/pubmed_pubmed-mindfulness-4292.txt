Study Title: Addressing Pandemic Burnout Among Health Care Professionals: Beyond Intrapersonal Wellness Programming.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic has been distressing to health care professionals, causing significant burnout. Burnout has resulted in notable rates of mental health symptoms and job turnover. Hospitals have incorporated programming to meet the needs of health care professionals. A previously reported intervention at the study institution was a cognitive behavioral narrative writing program to target job-related stress. On the basis of participant feedback, psychoeducational seminars, psychotherapy drop-in sessions, and complementary interventions (mindfulness, yoga, and acupuncture) were also implemented to alleviate stress. This article is an update based on these year 2 augmentations. Participation in brief psychoeducational seminars and acupuncture was high, but engagement in other programming (individual psychotherapy and mindfulness) was poor. Hospitals should consider multimodal approaches to address pandemic-related stress and burnout. In addition to educational seminars, programs that address lasting distress should be offered to health care professionals. Targeting job-related burnout at organizational and systemic levels may ameliorate distress. This article discusses methods of integrating organizational programs into clinics.
