Study Title: Early administration of postoperative BCAA-enriched PPN may improve lean body mass loss in gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy.

Study Summary:
It has been reported that weight loss or lean body mass (LBM) loss after gastrectomy for gastric cancer is associated with prognosis and nutritional support alone is insufficient to prevent LBM loss. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) play an important role in muscle catabolism, however their clinical effects on suppression of LBM loss in gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy remains elusive. In this current study, we investigated the effect of our original PPN regimen including BCAA (designated to BCAA-regimen) on LBM loss. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at a single institution where patients undergoing gastrectomy were assigned to either receive a five-day early postoperative course of the BCAA-regimen (BCAA group) or conventional nutrition. The primary endpoint was the % reduction in LBM at postoperative day 7. The secondary endpoints included the % reduction in LBM at 1 and 3&#xa0;months postsurgery. At postoperative day 7, LBM loss in the BCAA group tended to be lower than in the control group (0.16% vs. 1.7%, respectively; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.21), while at 1&#xa0;month postsurgery, LBM loss in the BCAA group was significantly different to that of the control group (-&#x2009;0.3% vs. 4.5%, respectively; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). At 3&#xa0;months postgastrectomy, however, LBM loss was similar between the BCAA and the control groups. Our RCT clinical trial clarified that early administration of the postoperative BCAA regimen improved LBM loss at 1&#xa0;month after surgery in gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy.
