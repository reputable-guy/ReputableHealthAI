Study Title: Effects of an Isotonic Beetroot Drink on Power Output During Sprint Exercise and Jump Performance in Physically Active Individuals: A Randomized Crossover Trial.

Study Summary:
Exogenous nitrate ingestion can improve exercise performance. This study investigated whether an isotonic beetroot drink could improve jump and sprint performance in active individuals. Twenty-three physically active participants (17 males, 6 females) (mean &#xb1; SD; age: 26 &#xb1; 4 years; body mass index: 22.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.9&#x2009;kg/m) completed a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study where they consumed 570mL of either beetroot juice drink (BR) or isotonic beetroot juice drink (ISO-BR) three hours before performing countermovement (CMJ) and standing broad jump (SBJ) tests and a 30-second all-out sprint on a cycle ergometer. Both drinks contained equal nitrate (12.9 mmol) and carbohydrate (6.1g per 100mL) content but differed in osmolality (BR: 420 mOsm/kg vs. ISO-BR: 315 mOsm/kg). Salivary total nitrate and nitrite concentrations (NOx) 3 hours post-ingestion were significantly higher after consuming ISO-BR than BR. ISO-BR significantly improved peak power output compared to BR by 3.9% (ISO-BR: 11.4 &#xb1; 2.5 W/kg vs. BR: 11.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.3&#x2009;W/kg,= .04) but not time to peak power (ISO-BR: 2.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.7&#x2009;s vs. BR: 2.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.6&#x2009;s,= .62) or mean power output (ISO-BR: 7.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;W/kg vs. BR: 7.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;W/kg,= .37). There were no significant differences in CMJ or SBJ between trials (> .05). Sensory evaluation indicated that ISO-BR was preferred by 91% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) of participants compared with BR (average score; ISO-BR: 5.52 vs. BR: 3.52,< .05). An ISO-BR drink improved peak power output during sprint cycling but not jump performance compared with BR alone, potentially via increased NO.
