Study Title: Efficacy and Feasibility of Intradialytic Plantar Electrical Stimulation in Patients With Diabetes: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigates the efficacy and feasibility of electrical stimulation (E-Stim) on sensory fibers of the plantar region during hemodialysis sessions, aiming to improve mobility in patients with diabetes by providing a connection between E-Stim and enhanced mobility with minimal patient effort required. Participants aged &#x2265;18 years with diabetes undergoing hemodialysis and able to walk at least 10 m with or without aid were recruited and divided into an intervention group receiving 1-h intradialytic E-Stim three times a week and a control group using an identical nonfunctional device for 12 weeks. Gait, physical activity, patient-reported outcomes, and the technology acceptance model were assessed to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness and acceptance. Out of 117 initial participants, 97 completed the study. Significant improvements were observed in the intervention group compared with the control group in gait performance (stride time at dual-task and fast walking), physical activity (stand to walk and sit to stand), quality of life, plantar numbness, and cognitive function after 12 weeks. The intervention group showed that magnitudes of improvement on gait performance and physical activity metrics were associated with enhancements in quality of life and cognitive function, respectively. The intervention group also reported higher usefulness and usage satisfaction, with a greater willingness to continue using E-Stim at home. The 12-week intradialytic E-Stim intervention is a feasible and effective method to enhance gait performance, physical activity level, cognitive function, and other patient-reported outcomes in patients undergoing hemodialysis, representing a practical, low-risk therapy option for those unable to engage in traditional exercise programs.
