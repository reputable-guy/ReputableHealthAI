Study Title: Exploring Experiences of People With Knee Osteoarthritis Who Received a Physiotherapist-Delivered Dietary Weight Loss and Exercise Intervention: A Mixed Methods Study.

Study Summary:
Explore the experiences of people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) who received a very low energy diet (VLED) and exercise program from a physiotherapist. Mixed methods study involving questionnaires (n = 42) and semistructured interviews (n = 22) with randomized control trial participants with knee OA who had received a 6-month physiotherapist-delivered VLED weight loss and exercise intervention. Questionnaires measured participant satisfaction and perceptions about physiotherapist's skills/knowledge in delivery of the dietary intervention (measured on 5-7 point Likert scales). Interviews explored participant's experiences and were analyzed based on the principles of reflexive thematic analysis. Questionnaire response: 90%. Participants were satisfied with the program (95%), confident their physiotherapist had the required skills (84%) and knowledge (79%) to deliver the dietary intervention, felt comfortable talking to the physiotherapist about weight (74%), and would recommend others see a physiotherapist for the intervention they undertook (71%). The following four themes were developed from the interviews: (1) one-stop-shop of exercise and diet; (2) physiotherapist-delivered weight loss works (unsure initially; successfully lost weight); (3) physiotherapists knowledge and skills (exercise is forte; most thought physiotherapists had the necessary weight loss skills/knowledge, but some disagreed); and (4) physiotherapists have a role in weight loss (physiotherapists are intelligent, credible, and trustworthy; specific training in weight loss necessary). This study provides, to our knowledge, the first documented perspectives from people with OA who have received a physiotherapist-delivered weight loss intervention. Findings suggest physiotherapists may have a role in delivering a protocolized dietary intervention for some people with knee OA with overweight and obesity.
