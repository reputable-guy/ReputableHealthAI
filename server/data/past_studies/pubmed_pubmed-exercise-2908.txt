Study Title: Acute effect of myofascial stretching exercise on spasticity, balance, ambulation status and mobility of posterior chain muscles in multiple sclerosis.

Study Summary:
To investigate the acute effect of myofascial stretching exercises on spasticity, balance, ambulation status and mobility of posterior chain muscles in multiple sclerosis. The study was conducted as a randomised controlled experimental study. The study included a total of 80 individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) with a mean age of 43.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.62&#x2009;years (experimental group) and 41.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.4&#x2009;years (control group). All individuals were treated once and evaluated before and after the session. After recording the sociodemographic characteristics, spasticity assessment was performed with the Modified Ashword Scale (MAS), balance assessment with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), ambulation status with the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and posterior chain muscle mobility (PCMM) with finger-to-ground distance measurement. The TUG (time to complete the distance) measurements of the experimental group after treatment were lower than those of the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The value of PCMM measurements of the experimental group before the treatment was lower than that of the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The difference in positive increase in PCMM measurements in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). After the treatment, the MAS value in the left knee of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Myofascial stretching exercises applied to individuals with MS made an acute contribution to ambulation status and mobility of posterior chain muscles. There was no difference in the evaluation of spasticity and balance.
