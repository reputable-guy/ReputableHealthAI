Study Title: Understanding Placebo and Nocebo Responses Based on a Randomized Sham-Controlled Study on Acupuncture in Integrative Cancer Care.

Study Summary:
Since placebo and nocebo-responses during acupuncture therapy are rarely studied in clinical contexts, the objective was to investigate placebo and nocebo-responses in a clinical context through comparing positive and negative side-effects between genuine and sham acupuncture, and to identify factors modifying placebo and nocebo-responses.Patients reported positive side-effects (non-intended positive effects) or negative side-effects (non-intended negative effects) of genuine (penetrating; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;109) or sham (telescopic non-penetrating; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;106) acupuncture during 5&#x2009;weeks of chemoradiation for cancer.The genuine and the sham acupuncture group reported rather similar frequencies of positive-values .223-.800) or negative (-values .072-1.0) side-effects: relaxation 59%/57% of the patients, improved mood 46%/38%, improved sleep 38%/38%, pain-reduction 36%/28%, tiredness 42%/42%, feeling cold 37%/31%, sweating 23%/21%, and dizziness 20%/12%. Positive side-effects occurred in 79% of patients who highly believed acupuncture to be effective, compared to in 0% of patients who did not believe. Other factors associated with placebo-response were female sex (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.042), anxious mood (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007), depressed mood (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.018), and blinding-success (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.033). Factors associated with nocebo response were female sex (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.049), younger age (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.010), and needle-induced pain (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.014). Sham-treated patients experiencing positive side-effects experienced better quality of life at the end of the treatment period (mean, m 64 on a scale 0-100 millimetres, Standard Deviation, SD, &#xb1;26.1&#x2009;mm) than those who did not (m 48&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;25.5&#x2009;mm),&#x2009;=&#x2009;.048 (adjusted for other characteristics).Clinically significant levels of placebo and nocebo effects commonly occurred during acupuncture therapy in integrative cancer care and this paper identified factors modifying these responses. This implicates that acupuncture-delivering therapists striving to maximize placebo-responses and minimize nocebo-responses may considering strengthen the patient's treatment expectations, and offer a pleasant, pain-free, acupuncture treatment.
