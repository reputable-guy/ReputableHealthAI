Study Title: Effect of virtual reality-based biofeedback for depressive and anxiety symptoms: Randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
The use of virtual reality (VR)-based biofeedback (BF), a relatively new intervention, is a non-pharmacological treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, studies on VR-based BF are lacking and inconclusive. A total of 131 adults were recruited from the community. Participants who scored &#x2265;10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or&#xa0;&#x2265;9 on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) were included in the group with depressive or anxiety symptoms (DAS group), and others as the healthy control group (HC group). Participants from the DAS group were randomly assigned to VR-based or conventional BF intervention. All individuals visited at three times (weeks 0, 2, and 4), and completed the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and a visual analog scale (VAS) before and after the intervention, and PHQ-9 at the beginning and final visit. The analysis included a total of 118 participants (DAS/VR: 40, DAS/BF: 38, HC/VR: 40). There was no significant difference in demographic variables among the three groups. After the intervention, the DAS/VR group exhibited significant decreases in MADRS (70.0 %), PHQ-9 (64.1 %), STAI (29.5 %), and VAS (61.7 %) scores compared to the baseline (p&#xa0;<0.001). There were no significant differences between the effects of VR-based BF and conventional BF with a therapist. The HC group also showed significant decreases in the measures of depression and anxiety after receiving VR-based BF. VR-based BF was effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, even for subthreshold depression and anxiety symptoms in the HC group.
