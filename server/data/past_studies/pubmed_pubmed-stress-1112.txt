Study Title: An ecological approach to humanizing healthcare organizations for patients, healthcare providers, and communities.

Study Summary:
Healthcare delivery exposes care providers and leaders to suffering, loss, moral dilemmas, conflicts, and overwhelm. The cumulative effects of workplace stress and trauma have organizational impacts (turnover, cynicism, and conflict), personal impacts (burnout, mental illness, and traumatic stress), and patient care impacts (reduced empathy, poor communication, and errors). Organizations have attempted to address these issues largely through individual wellness offerings. A systematic approach is needed to create environmental conditions that support people to remain resilient, engaged, and compassionately connected in the face of constant trauma exposure. This article describes an ecological model for developing and sustaining resilience based in neuro and social science. It includes practical strategies to reshape leaders' understanding, perspectives, and competencies to enhance systemic well-being.
