Study Title: Effect of exercise and manual therapy or kinesiotaping on sEMG and pain perception in chronic low back pain: a randomized trial.

Study Summary:
The importance of incorporating lumbo-pelvic stability core and controlling motor exercises in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) reinforces the use of strategies to improve biopsychosocial beliefs by reducing biomedical postulations. However, clinical practice guidelines recommend multimodal approaches incorporating exercise and manual therapy (MT), and instead reject the application of kinesiotape (KT) in isolation. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to analyze the effects of 12 weeks of exercises combined with MT or KT on perceived low back pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) and muscle electric activity measured with electromyography (EMG) of the rectus abdominis and multifidus in CLBP (mild disability) and to explore the relationship between the rectus abdominis and multifidus ratios and pain perception after intervention. A blinded, 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out, involving three parallel groups of patients with CLBP. The study was registered at Clinicaltrial.gov and assigned the identification number NCT05544890 (19/09/22). The trial underwent an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome revealed a multimodal treatment program supplemented by additional therapies such as MT and KT, resulting in significant reductions in perceived low back pain. The subjective assessment of individuals with CLBP indicated no discernible distinction between exclusive core stability exercises and control-motor training when combined with MT or KT. Notably, our findings demonstrated positive alterations in both the mean and peak EMG values of the right rectus abdominis in the exercise group, suggesting a beneficial impact on muscle activation. This study focused on assessing the activation levels of the trunk musculature, specifically the rectus abdominis (RA) and multifidus (MF), in individuals with CLBP exhibiting mild disability according to the Oswestry Disability Index. Importantly, improvements in the VAS values were observed independently of changes in muscle electrical activity.
