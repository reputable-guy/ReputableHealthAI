Study Title: Effect of Coenzyme Q10 on early wound healing after recession coverage surgery with the modified coronally advanced tunnel technique and a connective tissue graft: A 6-month, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial.

Study Summary:
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) or ubiquinone is one of a cell's most important electron carriers during oxidative phosphorylation and many other cellular processes. As a strong anti-oxidant with further anti-inflammatory effects CoQ10 is of potential therapeutical value. The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to investigate the effect of topical CoQ10 on early wound healing after recession coverage surgery using the modified coronally advanced tunnel (MCAT) and palatal connective tissue graft (CTG). Thirty patients with buccal gingival recessions were evaluated after being randomly allocated to: 1) MCAT and CTG with topical application of a coenzyme Q10 spray for 21 days or 2) MCAT and CTG with placebo spray. Wound healing was evaluated by the early wound healing index (EHI). Patient-reported pain was analyzed by a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) at day 2, 7, 14 and 21 post-surgically. Mean recession coverage, gain of keratinized tissue and esthetic outcomes were assessed at 6 months. EHI and pain scores showed no significant differences. Time to recovery defined as VAS<10 mm was shorter in the test group. Mean root coverage after 6 months was 84.62 &#xb1; 26.57% and 72.19 &#xb1; 26.30% for test and placebo, p=0.052. Complete root coverage was obtained in 9 (60%) test and in 2 (13.3%) placebo patients. Increase in keratinized tissue width and esthetical outcomes were similar for both groups. CoQ10 had no significant effect on early wound healing and on mean root coverage after 6 months. Early wound healing: in young healthy patients with no inflammatory oral conditions topical CoQ10 does not improve early healing.
