Study Title: An Ecological Study of a Universal Employee Depression Awareness and Stigma Reduction Intervention: "Right Direction".

Study Summary:
Right Direction (RD) was a component of a universal employee wellness program implemented in 2014 at Kent State University (KSU) to increase employees' awareness of depression, reduce mental health stigma, and encourage help-seeking behaviors to promote mental health. We explored changes in mental health care utilization before and after implementation of RD.KSU Human Resources census and service use data were used to identify the study cohort and examine the study objectives. A pre-post design was used to explore changes in mental health utilization among KSU employees before and after RD. Three post-intervention periods were examined. A generalized linear mixed model approach was used for logistic regression analysis between each outcome of interest and intervention period, adjusted by age and sex. Logit differences were calculated for post-intervention periods compared to the pre-intervention period.Compared to the pre-intervention period, the predicted proportion of employees seeking treatment for depression and anxiety increased in the first post-intervention period (OR = 2.14, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.37-3.34), then declined. Outpatient psychiatric treatment utilization increased significantly in the first two post-intervention periods (OR =1.89, 95% CI = 1.23-2.89; OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.11-2.76). No difference was noted in inpatient psychiatric treatment utilization across post-intervention periods. Unlike prescription for anxiolytic prescriptions, receipt of antidepressant prescriptions increased in the second (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.56-3.27) and third (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.46-3.20) post-intervention periods.Effects of RD may be realized over the long-term with follow-up enhancements such as workshops/informational sessions on mindfulness, stress management, resiliency training, and self-acceptance.
