Study Title: Comparative efficacy of erector spinae plane and quadratus lumborum blocks in managing postoperative pain for total abdominal hysterectomy: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Effective postoperative pain management after total abdominal hysterectomy is crucial for patient recovery and satisfaction. This study compared the efficacy of the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and quadratus lumborum block (QLB) in reducing postoperative opioid consumption and pain in patients with total abdominal hysterectomy. In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, 90 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy were divided into 3 groups: ESPB, QLB, and control. The primary outcome was postoperative opioid consumption. Secondary outcomes included pain scores assessed by the visual analog scale at predetermined times and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The ESPB and QLB groups showed a significant reduction in postoperative opioid consumption compared with the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001 for both comparisons). Pain scores were significantly lower in the ESPB and QLB groups than in the control group at 2, 6, and 24&#x2005;hours postoperatively (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001 at each time point). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was lower in the ESPB and QLB groups than that in the control group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.029). No significant differences were observed in opioid consumption or pain scores between the 2 groups. Both the erector spinae plane and quadratus lumborum blocks effectively reduced postoperative opioid consumption and pain in patients with total abdominal hysterectomy. These techniques offer a promising approach for postoperative pain management, potentially reducing the need for opioids.
