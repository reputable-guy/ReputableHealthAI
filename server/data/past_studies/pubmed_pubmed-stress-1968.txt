Study Title: Acute moderate normobaric hypoxia does not modify circulating thyroid hormone concentrations induced by 1 h of head-out cold-water immersion.

Study Summary:
This study tested the hypothesis that acute moderate normobaric hypoxia augments circulating thyroid hormone concentrations during and following 1 h of cold head-out water immersion (HOWI), compared with when cold HOWI is completed during normobaric normoxia. In a randomized crossover single-blind design, 12 healthy adults (27&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2 yr, 2 women) completed 1 h of cold (22.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.1&#xb0;C) HOWI breathing either normobaric normoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.21) or normobaric hypoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.14). Free and total thyroxine (T3) and triiodothyronine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were measured in venous blood samples obtained before (baseline), during (15-, 30-, and 60 min), and 15 min following HOWI (post-), and were corrected for changes in plasma volume. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and core (rectal) temperature were measured continuously. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was lower during hypoxia (90&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3%) compared with normoxia (98&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1%,< 0.001). Core temperature fell from baseline (normoxia: 37.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4&#xb0;C, hypoxia: 37.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4&#xb0;C) to post-cold HOWI (normoxia: 36.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5&#xb0;C, hypoxia: 36.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5&#xb0;C,< 0.001) in both conditions but did not change differently between conditions (condition &#xd7; time:= 0.552). Circulating TSH, total T3, free T4, total T3, and free T4 concentrations demonstrated significant main effects of time (all&#x2264; 0.024), but these changes did not differ between normoxic and hypoxic conditions (condition &#xd7; time: all&#x2265; 0.163). These data indicate that acute moderate normobaric hypoxia does not modify the circulating thyroid hormone response during 1 h of cold HOWI.Acute head-out cold (22&#xb0;C) water immersion (HOWI) decreased core temperature and increased thermogenesis. This thermogenic response was paralleled by the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, as evidenced by changes in thyroid hormones. However, cold HOWI in combination with moderate normobaric hypoxia did not modify the thermogenic nor the circulating thyroid hormone response. This finding suggests that hypoxia-induced alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations are unlikely to acutely contribute to adaptations resulting from repeated cold-water exposures.
