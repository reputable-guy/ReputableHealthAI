Study Title: Implementation of a Mindful Walking Intervention in Breast Cancer Patients After Their Primary Oncologic Treatment: Results of a Qualitative Study Within a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Breast cancer survivors often suffer from diagnosis- and therapy-related long-term side effects, such as cancer related fatigue, restricted stress resilience and quality of life. Walking as a physical activity and mindfulness practice have been shown to be helpful in studies. The aim of this study was to compare the individual experiences and subjectively perceived effects of walking in combination with mindfulness practice with moderate walking alone in breast cancer patients. This paper focuses on the qualitative results of a mixed-methods pilot study. Breast cancer patients who had finished their primary oncologic treatment at least 6&#x2009;months ago were randomized to an 8-week group intervention program of either mindful walking or moderate walking. Within the qualitative study part, semi-structured focus group interviews (2 interviews per study arm) were conducted and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Audio recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and pseudonymized. The subsequent data analysis was performed by using MAXQDA. A total of 51 women (mean age 55.8 [SD 10.9] years) were included in the RCT, among these 20 (mean age 56.7 [SD 12.0] years) participated in the focus group interviews (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11 patients of the mindful walking group; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9 patients of the walking group). Breast cancer patients in both groups described different effects in the complex areas of self-efficacy, coping, body awareness and self-reflection. While mindful walking primarily promoted body awareness and inner strength by mindfulness in breast cancer patients, moderate walking promoted self-efficacy by a confidence of their body and an easily integrated and accepted way of physical activity. Study interventions and the study setting triggered processes and reflections on one's own health and situation. However, mindful walking and moderate walking seem to address different resources. This important knowledge may help oncologists and other therapists to assess what type of interventions can best meet the needs and requirements of individual patients.
