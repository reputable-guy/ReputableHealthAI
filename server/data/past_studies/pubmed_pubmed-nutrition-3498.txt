Study Title: Continuous versus intermittent bolus infusion of calcium in preterm infants receiving total parenteral nutrition: a randomized blind clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Premature neonates need adequate nutritional support to provide sufficient essential nutrients for optimal growth. Calcium (Ca) is one of the important nutrients in parental nutrition support of premature infants. This study aimed to compare the effect of continuous and intermittent bolus infusion of Ca on the incidence of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in preterm infants. This randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted on ninety preterm infants in the NICU of Al-Zahra Hospital in Tabriz, Iran. The preterm infants were randomly allocated to either a continuous infusion group (received 4-5&#xa0;ml/kg/day of Ca gluconate 10% by PN solution in a 24-h period) or an intermittent bolus administration group (received 1-2&#xa0;ml/kg/day Ca gluconate 10% three to four times per day). Serial serum levels of Ca, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were assessed on the 7th day, 30th day and 45th day of life. A total of 78 infants completed the study. The serum ALP level on the 45th day after birth was 753.28&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;304.59 IU/L and 988.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;341.3 IU/L in the continuous infusion and intermittent bolus administration groups, respectively (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). MBD in preterm infants with ALP levels above 900 IU/L on the 45th day of life was significantly lower in the continuous infusion group than in the intermittent bolus administration group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The mean serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and PTH in 45-day-old infants were not significantly different between the two groups. The MBD in preterm infants who received continuous infusion of Ca was lower than that in preterm infants who received intermittent bolus administration of Ca.
