Study Title: Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with tinnitus retraining therapy on sleep disorders in patients with chronic tinnitus.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) combined with tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) on clinical efficacy and sleep disorder in patients with chronic tinnitus. 126 patients with chronic tinnitus treated in our hospital from May 2020 to June 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. These subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the electrical stimulation group and the combined group, in line with the random table method, with 63 patients in each group. Patients in the electrical stimulation group received TDCS treatment, and patients in the combined group were given TDCS combined with TRT. The clinical effects, tinnitus severity [Tinnitus Evaluation Questionnaire (TEQ) score and Tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) score], sleep status [Sleep Status Rating Scale (SRSS) score and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score], psychological status [Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score and Self Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score] and the quality of life (Quality of Life Scale) of these subjects in two groups were analyzed. The clinical effect of simple TDCS was 82.53%, which was sharply lower compared to 95.24% in the combined group (p<0.05). After the treatment, TEQ score, THI score, SRSS score, PSQI score, HAMA score, and SDS score were decreased in both groups (p<0.05), and the combined group was much lower than the TDCS group (p<0.01). Compared with the pre-treatment period, the scores of restrictions in daily living, medical resource utilization, somatic symptoms, and emotional disturbance were elevated in both groups after treatment, and the combined group had markedly higher scores than the TDCS group (p<0.05). TDCS combined with TRT had obvious effects in treating chronic tinnitus, which largely reduced the severity of tinnitus, improved patients' sleep quality and psychological status, and improved the quality of life, indicating a certain worthy of clinical application and promotion.
