Study Title: Effectiveness of an e-Health Quasi-Randomized Controlled Universal Prevention Program for Eating Disorders in Spanish Adolescents.

Study Summary:
Eating disorders (EDs) and sub-threshold conditions are prevalent in the adolescent population. Unfortunately, most preventive interventions have been targeted at emerging adults and the effectiveness of online prevention programs has yet to be determined in adolescents. This study sought to examine the short-term effectiveness of a universal e-Health psychoeducational prevention program for EDs compared to a control (non-intervention) group in Spanish adolescents. Using a quasi-randomized trial design, a total of 161 [% girls: 45.96; Mage(SD)&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.43 (0.43)] adolescents from 5 participating schools were allocated to two intervention arms: (1) psychoeducational intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;79) and (2) wait-list control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;82). The intervention was delivered over 3&#xa0;months through 3 modules that were accessible 24/7 and 3 school sessions guided by the students&#xb4; tutors focusing on nutrition, promoting a healthy lifestyle, mitigating body concerns, and social pressures. Participants completed an online assessment battery including the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) and measures of self-esteem, family disruption, compliance with the Mediterranean diet, and lifestyle. Correlational analysis showed small to moderate relationships between self-esteem and family function (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.413, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), BMI (body mass index) and the EAT-26 dieting subscale (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.417, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), physical activity and the bulimia subscale (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.237, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), and self-esteem and the dieting subscale (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.223, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). At the post-intervention assessment, the intervention group showed a statistically significant reduction in ED risk (EAT-26) (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.323, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.040) and the oral control subscale (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.327, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038). The e-health intervention including tutor-led digital components was effective for reducing ED risk in children. Results must be interpreted with caution due to the low statistical power and the limited sample size. Large scale randomized controlled trials with longer follow-ups will be needed to bolster the evidence.
