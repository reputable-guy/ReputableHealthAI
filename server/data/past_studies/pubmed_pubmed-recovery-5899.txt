Study Title: Physiotherapy for continence and muscle function in prostatectomy: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the effectiveness of pre- and postoperative supervised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on the recovery of continence and pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP). We carried out a single-blind randomised controlled trial involving 54 male patients scheduled to undergo RARP. The intervention group started supervised PFMT 2&#x2009;months before RARP and continued for 12&#x2009;months after surgery with a physiotherapist. The control group was given verbal instructions, a brochure about PFMT, and lifestyle advice. The primary outcome was 24-h pad weight (g) at 3&#x2009;months after RARP. The secondary outcomes were continence status (assessed by pad use), PFM function, and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score. Patients who participated in supervised PFMT showed significantly improved postoperative urinary incontinence (UI) compared with the control group (5.0&#x2009;[0.0-908.0] g vs 21.0 [0.0-750.0] g; effect size: 0.34, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022) at 3&#x2009;months after RARP based on 24-h pad weight. A significant improvement was seen in the intervention compared with the control group (65.2% continence [no pad use] vs 31.6% continence, respectively) at 12&#x2009;months after surgery (effect size: 0.34, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030). Peak pressure during a maximum voluntary contraction was higher in the intervention group immediately after catheter removal and at 6&#x2009;months, and a longer duration of sustained contraction was found in the intervention group compared with the control group. We were unable to demonstrate a difference between groups in EPIC scores. Supervised PFMT can improve postoperative UI and PFM function after RARP. Further studies are needed to confirm whether intra-anal pressure reflects PFM function and affects continence status in UI in men who have undergone RARP.
