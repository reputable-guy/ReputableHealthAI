Study Title: Influence of the intelligent knee osteoarthritis lifestyle app (iKOALA) on knee joint pain.

Study Summary:
The intelligent knee osteoarthritis lifestyle app (iKOALA) has been co-developed with target users to extend the support for physical activity (PA) and musculoskeletal health, beyond short-term structured rehabilitation, using personalised PA guidance, education, and social support. The purpose of this study was to assess the preliminary effectiveness and usability of the iKOALA digital intervention on indices of musculoskeletal (MSK) health, symptoms, and physical activity levels in a broad range of individuals with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) over 12 weeks to inform the design of a larger randomised controlled trial. Thirty-eight (33 female) participants living in the UK with a mean (SD) age of 58 (&#xb1;&#x2009;9) years diagnosed radiographically or clinically with KOA completed a 12-week user trial of the iKOALA. Participants completed an in-app physical activity questionnaire which intelligently recommended suitable strengthening and aerobic based activities to individuals. Throughout the trial, participants wore a physical activity monitor and were given access to functions within the app (physical activity (PA) reminders, information and education, symptom and PA tracking as well as social support forums) to support them in maintaining their PA plan. Participants completed a MSK questionnaire for chronic symptoms and quality of life (MSK-HQ) as well as an acute iKOALA symptoms questionnaire (confidence, fatigue, mood, pain during the day/night, sleep and ability to walk) in the week prior to starting and following completion of the trial. Physical activity levels were consistent over the 12 weeks with total daily steps of 9102 (&#xb1;&#x2009;3514) in week 1, 9576 (&#xb1;&#x2009;4214) in week 6 and 9596 (&#xb1;&#x2009;3694) in week 12. Group mean changes in all iKOALA MSK symptom scores and the total MSK-HQ (pre 33.1 (7.6) vs. post 40.2 (7.6)) score improved significantly (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001, 95% CI [-8.89, -5.16]) over the 12-week period. Physical activity levels were maintained at a high level throughout the 12 weeks. Significant improvements in mean MSK symptom scores and the total MSK-HQ score were also observed. Efforts to ensure more generalised reach amongst sex and socioeconomic status of the digital intervention in a randomised controlled clinical trial are warranted.
