Study Title: Neuromodulation with aerobic exercise reduces fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind study.

Study Summary:
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with aerobic exercise (tDCS-AE) effectively reduces fatigue in patients with fibromyalgia. However, no study has assessed this method in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with significant fatigue. Therefore, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of tDCS-AE for significant fatigue symptoms in adult female SLE patients. This randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind study included 25 patients with SLE in remission or low disease activity (SLEDAI-2K &#xa3;4) and with significant fatigue [&#x2265;36 points on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) or &#x2265;38 points on the Modified Fatigue Scale (MFIS)]. The patients received sham or tDCS for five consecutive days. The anode and cathode were positioned at M1 and Fp2, respectively (international 10-20 EEG system). tDCS was applied at an intensity of 2mA, and density of 0.057mA/cm2 in the tDCS-AE group. Both groups underwent combined low-intensity treadmill exercise. FSS, MFIS, pain visual analogue scale, physical activity, and sleep quality were evaluated at baseline and on days 7, 30, and 60. Adherence and safety were assessed using a standardised questionnaire. Improvement in fatigue levels was observed in both groups. However, a sustained reduction in fatigue levels on days 30 and 60 occurred only with tDCS-AEs (p<0.05). No significant differences were observed in pain level, sleep quality, or physical activity. No disease flares occurred and the adverse effects were mild and transient. Finally, the patient's adherence to the treatment was satisfactory. Despite isolated AEs, there was an improvement in fatigue, however, only tDCS-AE maintained significant and sustained improvement.
