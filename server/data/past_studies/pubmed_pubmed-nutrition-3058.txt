Study Title: Application of Sini Decoction at acupoint on gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with sepsis: A clinical study.

Study Summary:
The occurrence of gastrointestinal dysfunction is widely recognized as a prevalent complication in patients with sepsis. To investigate clinical effect of Sini Decoction at acupoint on gastrointestinal dysfunction in sepsis patients. Seventy-five patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by sepsis were randomly divided into 2 groups. Treatment group received routine Western medicine treatment combined with Sini Decoction at acupoint, while control group treated with talcum powder at acupoint. Treatments in both groups lasted 7 days. Changes in the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, sequential organ failure assessment score, mechanical ventilation duration, the length of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, enteral nutrition tolerance scores, abdominal circumference, gastric residual volume, bowel sounds, and serum index were observed. After treatment, the enteral nutrition tolerance score, abdominal circumference, gastric residual volume, and levels of lactate and interleukin-6 were significantly lower in the treatment group compared to the control group. Bowel sounds were more active and motilin levels were higher in the treatment group. Additionally, the length of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the treatment group than in the control group. Our findings demonstrated that the application of Sini Decoction at acupoints in sepsis patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction can effectively enhance gastrointestinal function, leading to a reduction in ICU stay duration and an improvement in patients' prognosis.
