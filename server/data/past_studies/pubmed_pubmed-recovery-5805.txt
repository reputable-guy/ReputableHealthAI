Study Title: The investigation of effect on foot plantar massage on functional recovery in older adults with general surgery, randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Foot massage is known to be effective on the emotional state (anxiety, depression, etc.) in the postoperative period. However, studies on its effect on functional level are insufficient. The study aimed to investigate the impact of foot plantar massage on functional recovery in older adults undergoing general surgery, employing a randomized clinical trial design. A total of 70 older adults aged 65 years and above who underwent abdominal surgery were included. Various assessments were conducted, including pain levels (Visual Analogue Scale), fear of mobility (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia), functional independence (Functional Independence Measure), balance (Berg Balance Scale), basic mobility (Rivermead Mobility Index), mental function status (Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination), and delirium (Nu-DESC). Statistically significant differences were observed in some assessment parameters within the groups during the 2nd and 3rd measurement times, with the intervention group demonstrating significant mean differences. The literature underscores the increase in kinesiophobia scores post-general/abdominal surgery in older adults, emphasizing the importance of evaluating functional level and kinesiophobia to expedite discharge processes and potentially plan early post-discharge rehabilitation to mitigate readmissions for functional reasons. Ultimately, foot massage was found to be effective in reducing kinesiophobia, improving balance, mobility, daily living skills, and mental status in older adults post-abdominal surgery, thereby advocating for the facilitation of post-discharge rehabilitation programs or the reduction of readmission rates.
