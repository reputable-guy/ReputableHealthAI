Study Title: Influence of motivational interviewing on postoperative mobilization in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS&#xae;) pathway in elective colorectal surgery - a randomized patient-blinded pilot study.

Study Summary:
Early mobilization is an essential component of the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS&#xae;)-pathway. However, a large percentage of patients fail to achieve the ERAS&#xae; recommended goal (360 min out of bed from post-operative day 1/POD1). Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based type of patient-centered consultation to promote intrinsic motivation. This study aims to evaluate if MI can improve postoperative mobilization. This two-arm, patient-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial included ERAS&#xae;-patients undergoing elective bowel resections. Conversations were validated by MI Treatment Integrity. Two validated motion sensors (movisens) and self-assessments were used to measure mobilization (POD1-POD3: Time out of bed, time on feet and step count). 97 patients were screened, 60 finally included and randomized. Cumulatively across POD1-3, the intervention group (IG) was longer out of bed than the control group (CG) (median: 685 vs. 420 min; p=0.022). The IG achieved the ERAS&#xae;-goal of 360 min/day more frequently across POD1-3 (27.4% vs. 10.61%; p=0.013). Time on feet was 131.5 min/day (median per POD) in IG vs. 95.8 min/day in the CG (p=0.212), step count was 1347 in IG vs. 754 steps/day in CG (p=0.298). MI could be conducted low threshold and was well accepted by patients. MI can improve mobilization in the context of ERAS&#xae;. Despite better performance, it should be noted that only 27.4% of the IG reached the ERAS&#xae;-compliance goal of 360 min/day. The findings of this pilot study stipulate to further test the promising perioperative effects of MI within a multicenter superiority trial. This study was registered prospectively in the German Clinical Trials Register on 25.02.2022. Trial registration number is "DRKS00027863".
