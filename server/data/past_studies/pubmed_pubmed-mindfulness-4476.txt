Study Title: Variables related to health-related quality of life among breast cancer survivors after participation in an interdisciplinary treatment combining mindfulness and physiotherapy.

Study Summary:
Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment increase the potential psychological impact on breast cancer survivors (BCS). The objective of this study was to assess the effects of an interdisciplinary intervention during follow-up in BCS and identify variables related to improvements in HRQoL. In a non-randomised quasi-experimental design performed on an outpatient basis in a hospital gynaecology and oncology unit, 60 BCS were assigned to an interdisciplinary experimental group (EG) or a usual care group (CG). The EG underwent 12 sessions of an interdisciplinary program which included Mindfulness and physiotherapy, for 120&#x2009;min per day, once a week for 6&#x2009;weeks. At baseline, at 6&#x2009;weeks and at 3&#x2009;months after the intervention, participants of EG and CG completed an assessment of HRQoL (EuroQol and EORTC-QLQ-C30) and symptomatology of anxiety and depression. Additionally, EG completed an assessment of satisfaction with the treatment. For data analysis, we used descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-square and Fisher tests and generalised linear models. After 6&#x2009;weeks, statistically significant differences were apparent in global and cancer-related health symptoms such as fatigue and pain in the EORTC QLQ-C30 and in anxiety and depression, among the EG (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) compared with the CG (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). Patients receiving the intervention reported a high degree of satisfaction with the treatment. Three months after the intervention, patients in the EG continued to show statistically significant improvements compared with the CG. In addition, allocation to the EG was identified as a variable related to improvement of HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) in the multivariable model. The results of our study suggest that a 6-week interdisciplinary intervention may improve HRQoL and symptomatology of anxiety and depression in BCS patients at 3&#x2009;months. The study presents data that the intervention for BCS appears promising and warrants further study in a randomised controlled trial.
