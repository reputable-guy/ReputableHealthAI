Study Title: Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation and functional outcomes in multitrauma patients: A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a nutrition supplement that may attenuate muscle wasting from critical illness. This trial aimed to determine feasibility of administering a blinded nutrition supplement in the intensive care unit (ICU) and continuing it after ICU discharge. Single-center, parallel-group, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized feasibility trial. After traumatic injury necessitating admission to ICU, participants were randomized to receive an enteral study supplement of 3&#x2009;g of HMB (intervention) or placebo daily for 28 days or until hospital discharge. Primary outcome was feasibility of administering the study supplement, quantified as protocol adherence. Secondary outcomes included change in quadriceps muscle thickness, measured weekly until day 28 or hospital discharge by using ultrasound and analyzed by using a linear mixed model. Fifty randomized participants (intervention, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26; placebo, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) showed comparable baseline characteristics. Participants received 862 (84.3%) of the 1022 prescribed supplements during hospitalization with 543 (62.8%) delivered via an enteral feeding tube. The median (IQR) number of study supplements successfully administered per participant was 19.5 (13.0-24.0) in the intervention group and 16.5 (8.5-23.5) in the placebo group. Marked loss of quadriceps muscle thickness occurred in both groups, with the point estimate favoring attenuated muscle loss with the intervention, albeit with wide CIs (mean intervention difference after 28 days, 0.26&#x2009;cm [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.64]). A blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of daily enteral HMB supplementation for up to 28 days in hospital is feasible. Any effect of HMB supplementation to attenuate muscle wasting after traumatic injury remains uncertain.
