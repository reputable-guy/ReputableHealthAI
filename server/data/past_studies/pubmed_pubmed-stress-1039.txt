Study Title: Psychosocial and physical wellbeing in women and male partners undergoing immediate versus postponed modified natural cycle frozen embryo transfer after ovarian stimulation and oocyte pick-up: a sub-study of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Are there differences in psychosocial and physical wellbeing among women and male partners undergoing modified natural cycle (mNC) frozen embryo transfer (FET) in immediate compared to postponed cycles after ovarian stimulation (OS) and oocyte pick-up (OPU)? Significantly more women in the immediate group reported physical symptoms than women in the postponed group whilst fewer were emotionally affected by waiting time, although the latter difference lost statistical significance after adjustment for multiple testing. Infertility and fertility treatment are known to cause psychosocial distress in women and couples longing for a child. The treatment may be long-term and delayed for various reasons, such as the elective postponement of FET after a fresh transfer without pregnancy or an elective freeze-all cycle, possibly further increasing the level of distress. Sub-study of an ongoing multicentre randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial assessing the optimal timing for mNC-FET treatment after OS and OPU. Participants were randomized 1:1 to mNC-FET in the cycle immediately following OS or mNC-FET in a subsequent cycle. The study is based on data from the first women (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;300) and male partners (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;228) invited to answer a self-reported questionnaire assessing psychosocial and physical wellbeing. Data were collected from April 2021 to March 2024. Questionnaires were distributed to all randomized women and their male partners on cycle day 2-5 of mNC-FET cycles and returned before the administration of ovulation trigger. The questionnaire consisted of validated items originating from the Copenhagen Multicentre Psychosocial Infertility-Fertility Problem Stress Scale (COMPI-FPSS) and Marital Benefit Measure (COMPI-MBM). Emotional reactions to waiting time in fertility treatment, mental health, general quality-of-life, and physical symptoms were also assessed. Questionnaire response rates were 90.3% for women and 80.0% for male partners in the immediate group, and 82.3% for women and 57.3% for male partners in the postponed group. Approximately 90% of all women worried to some or a great extent about whether the treatment would be successful. More women in the postponed group reported that they were emotionally affected by the waiting time from OPU to blastocyst transfer to some or to a great extent (57.4% versus 73.9% in the immediate versus postponed group, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014), but the results were not significant after adjustment for multiple testing (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.125). For male partners, no difference in emotional reactions to waiting time between groups was found. There was no significant difference in total infertility-related stress or symptoms of severe depression between the immediate and the postponed group for women or male partners, but women were generally more distressed than their partners. There was a significantly higher incidence of stomach and/or pelvic pain (24.0% versus 9.4%, adjusted P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013), feeling of being bloated (33.8% versus 15.1%, adjusted P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010) and swollen or tender breasts (24.8% versus 0.9%, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) in the immediate group. All items were self-reported. No assessment of psychosocial or physical wellbeing was performed before participant enrolment. The sample size of male partners was relatively small, and female partners were not included in this sub-study due to a very small number of participants in this group. If immediate mNC-FET proves to be effective, physical and emotional factors may play a key role in choosing treatment strategy for the individual patient. This study demonstrated more physical symptoms related to OS in the immediate cycles.
