Study Title: A mobile mindfulness intervention for emergency department staff to improve stress and wellbeing: A qualitative study.

Study Summary:
Occupational stress and burnout in emergency departments (ED) are prominent issues requiring effective solutions. In other health settings use of a smartphone mindfulness app have been shown to be a cost-effective strategy for stress management. To understand ED staff's experiences of practicing mindfulness using a smartphone app. A qualitative study was undertaken with 24 ED staff at two Australian EDs who had used a mindfulness app for 4&#xa0;weeks. Semi-structured, one-to-one interviews were conducted between late 2019 and early 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Descriptive description was utilised in content analysis. Four main themes were identified: individuality in use of the app, perceived benefits and impacts on life, perceived barriers and enablers to use. Participants reported that mindfulness practice had numerous benefits including better stress and anxiety management, as well as improved general wellbeing. The main barriers to mindfulness practice were poor time management for mindfulness and lack of motivation. Reported enablers included a strong desire for promoting wellbeing and the ability to embed practice into existing routine. Practicing mindfulness with a smartphone app is a useful strategy to promote ED staff wellness and manage stress. Healthcare organisations should consider the implementation of a mindfulness app for staff.
