Study Title: A 6-month randomized controlled trial for vitamin E supplementation in pediatric patients with Gaucher disease: Effect on oxidative stress, disease severity and hepatic complications.

Study Summary:
Enzymatic deficiency in Gaucher disease (GD) may induce oxidative stress. Vitamin E is the nature's most effective lipid-soluble antioxidant. This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive oral vitamin E for 6&#x2009;months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with healthy controls (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6&#x2009;months of vitamin E supplementation, SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative stress, and improving outcomes.
