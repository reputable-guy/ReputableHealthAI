Study Title: Effectiveness of technology-aided education on self-efficacy among individuals post pulmonary surgery: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Patient education is an effective tool in enhancing compliance and comprehension to therapy. Preoperative video-based education (VBE) on knowledge and understanding of surgical procedures and physical therapy provides an insight into the essential need for treatment adherence and early post-operative recovery. Self-efficacy (SE) is an individual self-belief about one's ability to cope and is denoted as a sign of healthy behavior and empowerment. Although little is known about VBE and self-efficacy (SE) in rehabilitation of pulmonary surgery patients. The objective was to assess the influence of VBE in pulmonary rehabilitation on SE post pulmonary surgery patients using the Manipal Self Efficacy Questionnaire (MSEQ). Study design: Mixed methods pilot study. The MSEQ and educational video were designed and developed for this study. Piloting was conducted with the MSEQ (CVI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.95) and educational video (CVI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1). After approval from the ethics committee, written informed consent was obtained from twenty preoperative pulmonary surgery patients were randomized to two groups. The control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) received routine post-operative exercises and experimental group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) received preoperative VBE along with exercises. Validation of MSEQ and educational video was derived as per content validation index. Mann- Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to compare the groups. SE scores in the experimental group was higher than the control (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004). VBE on PR improved SE of the patients after pulmonary surgery. The study's main limitation was the difficulty in attaining the desired sample size because it was a time-bound study.
