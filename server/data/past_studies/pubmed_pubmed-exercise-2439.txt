Study Title: Aerobic exercise elevates perceived appetite but does not modify energy intake over a 3-day postexercise period: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
While a low degree of energy compensation is typically reported over the 24&#x2009;h following a session of exercise, the prolonged impact of a bout of exercise on energy intake remains unclear. To overcome the challenge associated with accurately measuring energy intake in a free-living environment, this study employed the use of a meal replacement beverage to assess the 3&#x2009;day impact of an exercise session on energy intake. In a randomized, crossover study, 14 participants (8 male, 6 female) completed two trials: (1) EX: 75&#x2009;min exercise on a motorized treadmill (75% VO); and (2) SED: 75&#x2009;min sedentary control session. Each condition was followed by 3&#x2009;days of exclusive ad&#xa0;libitum consumption of a meal replacement beverage. Appetite-regulating hormones, subjective appetite, energy intake, and energy expenditure were assessed. Exercise transiently suppressed the orexigenic hormone acyl-ghrelin (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and elevated the appetite-supressing hepatokine GDF-15 (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Despite these acute changes, overall perceived appetite was elevated over the 3&#x2009;day assessment period with exercise (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). No increase in energy intake or change in postexercise physical activity patterns were observed. One acute session of moderate to vigorous exercise is unlikely to affect short-term, three-day energy balance in healthy individuals.
