Study Title: The British Columbia Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program Reduces Short-Term Household Food Insecurity Among Adults With Low Incomes: A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The British Columbia Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program (BC FMNCP) provides households with low incomes with coupons to purchase healthy foods from farmers' markets. To examine the impact of the BC FMNCP on the short-term household food insecurity, malnutrition risk, mental well-being, sense of community (secondary outcomes), and subjective social status (exploratory outcome) of adults with low incomes post-intervention and 16 weeks post-intervention. Secondary analyses from a pragmatic randomized controlled trial conducted in 2019 that collected data at baseline, post-intervention, and 16 weeks post-intervention. Adults &#x2265;18 years with low incomes were randomized to an FMNCP group (n&#xa0;= 143) or a no-intervention control group (n&#xa0;= 142). Participants in the FMNCP group received 16 coupon sheets valued at $21 Canadian dollars (CAD)/sheet over 10 to 15 weeks to purchase healthy foods from farmers' markets and were eligible to participate in nutrition skill-building activities. Outcomes included short-term household food insecurity (modified version of Health Canada's 18-item Household Food Security Survey Module), malnutrition risk (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale), sense of community (Brief Sense of Community Scale), and subjective social status (MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status community scale). Mixed-effects linear regression and multinomial logistic regression examined between-group differences in outcomes post-intervention and 16 weeks post-intervention. The risk of marginal and severe short-term household food insecurity was lower among those in the FMNCP group compared with those in the control group (relative risk ratio [RRR] 0.15, P&#xa0;= 0.01 and RRR 0.16, P&#xa0;= 0.02) post-intervention, with sustained reductions in severe household food insecurity 16 weeks post-intervention (RRR 0.11, P&#xa0;= 0.01). No statistically significant differences were observed in malnutrition risk, mental well-being, sense of community, or subjective social status post-intervention or 16 weeks post-intervention. The BC FMNCP reduced short-term household food insecurity but was not found to improve malnutrition risk or psychosocial well-being among adults with low incomes compared with a no-intervention control group.
