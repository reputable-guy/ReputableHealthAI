Study Title: Short-Term L-Citrulline Supplementation Does Not Affect Inspiratory Muscle Oxygenation and Respiratory Performance in Older Adults.

Study Summary:
In sports nutrition, nitric oxide (NO) precursors such as L-citrulline are widely used to enhance NObioavailability, which is considered an ergogenic aid. Our study aimed to examine the effect of short-term L-citrulline supplementation on respiratory muscles' performance, fatigue, and oxygenation in older adults. Fourteen healthy older males took 6 g of L-citrulline or a placebo for seven days in a double-blind crossover design. Pulmonary function via spirometry (i.e., forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV), forced vital capacity (FVC), and their ratio)), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (NO), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), rate of perceived exertion, and sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation (i.e., oxyhemoglobin (&#x394;[OHb]) and de-oxyhemoglobin (&#x394;[HHb]), total hemoglobin concentration (&#x394;[tHb]), and tissue saturation index (TSI%)) were evaluated at baseline, after seven days of L-citrulline supplementation, and after incremental resistive breathing to task failure of the respiratory muscles. The exhaled NOvalue was only significantly increased after the supplementation (26%< 0.001) in the L-citrulline condition. Pulmonary function, MIP, rate of perceived exertion, and sternocleidomastoid muscle oxygenation were not affected by the L-citrulline supplementation. In the present study, although short-term L-citrulline supplementation increased exhaled NO, no ergogenic aids were found on the examined parameters at rest and after resistive breathing to task failure in older adults.
