Study Title: Comparing the effect of two systems-level interventions on perinatal generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

Study Summary:
The Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms and PRogram In Support of Moms are designed to help obstetric practices address perinatal depression. The PRogram in Support of Moms includes the statewide Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms program, plus proactive implementation support. The goal of this study was to understand the impact of these programs on perinatal generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms among individuals screening positive for depression. We conducted a secondary analysis of 2017-2022 data from a cluster randomized controlled trial of Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms vs PRogram In Support of Moms. We included participants completing a generalized anxiety disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder screen at baseline (n=254) with antenatal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores &#x2265;10. We assessed changes in generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms from pregnancy (4-25 weeks of gestational age or 32-40 weeks of gestational age), 4-12 weeks postpartum, and 11-13 months postpartum. We conducted a difference-in-difference analysis to compare symptom change from pregnancy to postpartum. We used adjusted linear mixed models with repeated measures to examine the impact of the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms and PRogram In Support of Moms on changes in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. Mean Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 scores decreased by 3.6 (Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms) and 6.3 (PRogram In Support of Moms) points from pregnancy to 4-12 weeks postpartum. Mean Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist scores decreased by 6.2 and 10.0 points, respectively, at 4-12 weeks postpartum among individuals scree ning positive on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (n=83) or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (n=58) in pregnancy. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist scores decreased among both groups at 11-13 months postpartum. These changes were clinically meaningful. PRogram In Support of Moms conferred a statistically significant greater decrease (2.7 points) on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 than the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms at 4-12 weeks postpartum. No differences were found between the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms and PRogram In Support of Moms in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist or Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 change at 11-13 months, although both were associated with a reduction in generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at 4-12 weeks and 11-13 months postpartum. Both the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program for Moms and PRogram In Support of Moms could help to improve symptoms for individuals experiencing co-occurring symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder. PRogram In Support of Moms may confer additional benefits in the early postpartum period, although this difference was not clinically significant.
