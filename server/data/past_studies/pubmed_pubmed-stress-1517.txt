Study Title: Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism Prevents Aortic Plaque Progression and Reduces Left Ventricular Mass and Fibrosis in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease: The MAGMA Trial.

Study Summary:
Persistent mineralocorticoid receptor activation is a pathologic response in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Whereas mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are beneficial in reducing cardiovascular complications, direct mechanistic pathways for these effects in humans are lacking. The MAGMA trial (Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism Clinical Evaluation in Atherosclerosis) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with high-risk type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (not receiving dialysis) on maximum tolerated renin-angiotensin system blockade. The primary end point was change in thoracic aortic wall volume, expressed as absolute or percent value (&#x394;TWV or &#x394;PWV), using 3T magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months. Secondary end points were changes in left ventricle (LV) mass; LV fibrosis, measured as a change in myocardial native T1; and 24-hour ambulatory and central aortic blood pressures. Tertiary end points included plasma proteomic changes in 7596 plasma proteins using an aptamer-based assay. A total of 79 patients were randomized to placebo (n=42) or 25 mg of spironolactone daily (n=37). After a modified intent-to-treat, including available baseline data of study end points, patients who completed the trial protocol were included in the final analyses. At the 12-month follow-up, the average change in PWV was 7.1&#xb1;10.7% in the placebo group and 0.87&#xb1;10.0% in the spironolactone group (=0.028), and &#x394;TWV was 1.2&#xb1;1.7 cmin the placebo group and 0.037&#xb1;1.9 cmin the spironolactone group (=0.022). Change in LV mass was 3.1&#xb1;8.4 g in the placebo group and -5.8&#xb1;8.4 g in the spironolactone group (=0.001). Changes in LV T1 values were significantly different between the placebo and spironolactone groups (26.0&#xb1;41.9 ms in the placebo group versus a decrease of -10.1&#xb1;36.3 ms in the spironolactone group;=6.33&#xd7;10). Mediation analysis revealed that the spironolactone effect on thoracic aortic wall volume and myocardial mass remained significant after adjustment for ambulatory and central blood pressures. Proteomic analysis revealed a dominant effect of spironolactone on pathways involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and leukocyte activation. Among patients with diabetes with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease at elevated cardiovascular risk, treatment with spironolactone prevented progression of aortic wall volume and resulted in regression of LV mass and favorable alterations in native T1, suggesting amelioration of left-ventricular fibrosis.
