Study Title: Effectiveness of Postburn Pruritus Treatment and Improvement of Insomnia-A Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
Postburn pruritus is difficult to assess and treat. Antihistamines used in its treatment provide little relief. Identification of the itch neuronal pathway has inspired new alternatives, including gabapentin, for its management. The study compared the effectiveness of cetirizine, gabapentin, and a combination of gabapentin and cetirizine in treating postburn pruritus. Burn patients were randomly assigned to treatment with Cetirizine (n = 23), Gabapentin (n = 23), or Cetirizine plus Gabapentin (n = 23). A baseline assessment of the intensity or the severity of pruritus was evaluated, after which treatment commenced with standard doses of the 3 study regimens. Quality of sleep was assessed at baseline (day 0) and repeated on day 3, day 7, and day 14. Approximately 97% of participants presented with moderate or severe itch; 69% with acute itch; and the majority (94.2%) experienced pruritus between the first and fourth weeks. Gabapentin reduced itch by 92.9% in 14 days compared to cetirizine's 61.8%. The combined effect of cetirizine and gabapentin was comparable using gabapentin alone. When the itch became protracted over 6 weeks, the effectiveness of cetirizine in controlling itch worsened. It reduced itch intensity by only 37.7%, whilst gabapentin did so at 89.4%. Itch intensity correlated positively with insomnia, and controlling itch intensity improved sleep. Gabapentin was more effective for the treatment of postburn pruritus than cetirizine. Controlling itch intensity improved sleep. In acute and moderate itch, low-dose gabapentin could be added if cetirizine is the drug intended for its treatment.
