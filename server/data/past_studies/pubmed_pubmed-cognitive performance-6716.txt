Study Title: Experimental non-severe hypoglycaemia substantially impairs cognitive function in type 2 diabetes: a randomised crossover trial.

Study Summary:
Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between cognitive impairment and hypoglycaemia (<3&#xa0;mmol/l). This study hypothesised that non-severe insulin-induced hypoglycaemia reduces cognitive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In this randomised crossover study, 25 participants with type 2 diabetes attended two experimental visits with hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamping: one hypoglycaemic clamp (plasma glucose 3.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.2&#xa0;mmol/l) and one euglycaemic clamp (plasma glucose 6.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.2&#xa0;mmol/l). Participants were eligible if their diabetes was treated with diet or glucose-lowering medications (except sulfonylureas or insulin), age was 35-70&#xa0;years, BMI was 23-35&#xa0;kg/mand HbAwas below 75&#xa0;mmol/mol (9%). Cognitive function was assessed with a neurocognitive test battery measuring verbal memory, executive function, sustained attention and psychomotor speed. From the examined cognitive domains, a global cognition score was constructed estimating global cognition. A measurement for psychomotor speed was selected as the primary outcome. Participants and people assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. Cognitive performance was impaired during hypoglycaemia with a mean score in the primary outcome test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test measuring psychomotor speed, of 48.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.8 (hypoglycaemia) vs 56.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;12.0 (euglycaemia); i.e. a change of -7.9 points (95% CI -10.9, -4.9; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001). In addition, hypoglycaemia reduced global cognitive score by -0.7 (95% CI -0.9, -0.6; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001). A stable glucose plateau was achieved during both experimental visits. For the hypoglycaemic clamp, mean plasma glucose concentration (&#xb1; SD) during neurocognitive testing was 3.1 (&#xb1; 0.3) mmol/l. Age, sex, fasting C-peptide, counter-regulatory hormones and the severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms did not influence cognitive function. Acute non-severe hypoglycaemia (mean plasma glucose 3.1&#xa0;mmol/l) has a substantial negative impact on cognitive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03014011.
