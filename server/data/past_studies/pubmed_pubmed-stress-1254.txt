Study Title: Effectiveness of psychosocial education program on postnatal depression, stress, and perceived maternal parenting self-efficacy among pregnant women in South India.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a psychosocial education program on postnatal depression (PND), perceived stress, (PSS), and perceived maternal parenting self-efficacy (PMPSE). A randomized controlled trial design was used with stratified block randomization. The sample size consisted of 128 pregnant women. The women in the experimental group were provided with a psychosocial education program along with standard care, and the control group received standard care with an information pamphlet. Post-test assessments (PND, PSS, and PMPSE) were performed at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after delivery in both groups. The result of the effect of the intervention on outcome variables on repeated measures ANOVA revealed that there was a positive statistically significant reduction in scores of postnatal depression [F (1, 119) =&#xa0;18.832, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001] and perceived stress [F (1,119) =&#xa0;22.488, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;< 0.001] and no statistically significant change in perceived maternal parenting self-efficacy in the experimental group [F (1,119) =&#xa0;0.036, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.850]. The psychosocial education program was found to be effective in reducing postnatal depression and stress related to pregnancy and childbirth to enable a smooth transition to motherhood. Given the benefits the program provides to women, this psychosocial education program could be incorporated into routine antenatal care for pregnant women.
