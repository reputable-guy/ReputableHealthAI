Study Title: Efficacy of facilitated tucking position and Reiki given to preterm infants during orogastric tube insertion: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This research was conducted to evaluate the effects of Reiki and facilitated tucking position on pain, stress and physiologic parameters in preterm infants during orogastric tube (OGT) insertion. The study used a single-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled experimental design. It was carried out in the neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital in Ni&#x11f;de/Turkey between February 2022 and January 2023. A total of 45 preterm infants, who met the study criteria and whose sample size was determined according to power analysis, were randomly divided into three groups. As an intervention, the facilitated tucking position was applied to the first group, and Reiki was applied to the second group during OGT insertion. Routine application continued in the control group. The Infant Introductory Information Form, Physiological Parameter Follow-up Chart, Infant Stress Scale (ISS) and Premature Infant Pain Profile Scale-Revised (PIPP-R) were used for data collection. Significance was accepted as P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05 in the statistical analysis. It was determined that the infants were homogeneously distributed between the experimental and control groups (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Infants who received the facilitated tucking position and Reiki intervention had better physiological stability compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The group with the lowest average stress (1.53&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.99) and pain scores (4.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.22) during OGT insertion was the facilitated tucking group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). After the procedure, stress and pain scores in both the facilitated tucking group and the Reiki group were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The results of the study showed that the facilitated tucking position during OGT insertion was especially effective in reducing the pain and stress of infants. Both the facilitated tucking position and Reiki were determined to be effective interventions in reducing the pain and stress of infants more quickly after the procedure. The results of study contribute to the recommendation that NICU nurses should include non-pharmacological methods to decrease the pain of preterm infants during procedural pain.
