Study Title: Pilot study evaluating a 12-h mindfulness-based curriculum for OB/GYN residents.

Study Summary:
This prospective cohort study assessed the impact of a 12-h mindfulness-based wellness curriculum on OB-GYN residents' burnout, mindfulness, and self-compassion. Fourteen 1st year OB-GYN residents at the University of California, Irvine (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7 in two separate cohorts) were eligible and participated in a 12-h, in-person wellness curriculum between January 2017 and May 2018 emphasizing meditation training, present moment emotional awareness, and self-compassion. The curriculum included didactic and experiential components and home-based exercises. Participants were assessed before starting the curriculum (T1), after finishing the curriculum (T2), and 6-9-months later (T3) using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). Fourteen residents (100%) completed the survey at T1, 13 residents (93%) completed the survey at T2, and 12 residents (86%) completed the survey at T3. Levels of burnout did not change significantly. Overall mindfulness increased from T1 to T3 (p&#xa0;< .05), as did non-judging inner experiences (p&#xa0;< .01). Overall levels of self-compassion increased from T1 to T3 (p&#xa0;< .05), with self-kindness and self-judgment improving from T1 to T3 (both p&#xa0;< .05). The vast majority of improvements were evident at the 6-9-month follow-up. This study provides preliminary support that a mindfulness-based wellness curriculum may improve overall levels of mindfulness and self-compassion in 1st year OB-GYN residents.
