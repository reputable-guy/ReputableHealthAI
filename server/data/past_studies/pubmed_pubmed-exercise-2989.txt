Study Title: Effect of high-intensity interval training on cardiometabolic component risks in persons with paraplegia: Results of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this work is to determine the effect of upper-body high intensity interval training (HIIT) on cardiometabolic risks in individuals with chronic paraplegia. Twenty-seven individuals (14 females, 13 males, mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD age: 46&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9&#xa0;years) with chronic paraplegia (spinal cord injury between T2 and L5 >1-year post-injury) took part in a randomized controlled trial and were included in the final analysis. Participants in the HIIT group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;18) performed &#x223c;30&#xa0;min of arm crank exercise (60&#xa0;s intervals at 80%-90% peak heart rate) four times per week, for 6&#xa0;weeks. Participants in the control (CON) group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;9) were asked to maintain their habitual diet and physical activity patterns over the study period. Outcome measures were taken at baseline and follow-up. The primary outcome measures were fasting insulin, peak power output (PPO) and peak aerobic capacity (). Secondary outcome measures included body composition, postprandial glycaemic control, fasting blood lipids, inflammatory biomarkers and resting blood pressure. Differences between groups were assessed by ANCOVA, using baseline values as a covariate. PPO was higher in the HIIT (101&#xa0;W, 97-106) compared to the CON (90&#xa0;W, 83-96) group at follow-up (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006). There were no differences in fasting insulin (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.415) or relative(P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.417). Postprandial Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was higher in the HIIT (5.42, 4.69-6.15) compared to the CON (3.75, 2.46-5.04) group at follow-up (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036). Six weeks of upper-body HIIT increased PPO and ISI, with no other beneficial effect on cardiometabolic component risks in persons with chronic paraplegia. HIGHLIGHTS: What is the central question of this study? What is the effect of upper-body high intensity interval training (HIIT) on cardiometabolic component risks in individuals with chronic paraplegia? What is the main finding and its importance? Six weeks of upper-body HIIT increased PPO and improved insulin sensitivity, but had no beneficial effect on other cardiometabolic component risks in persons with chronic paraplegia. The large effect size observed for insulin sensitivity may be important in terms of reducing the risk of type-2 diabetes in this population.
