Study Title: Stilbenes: a journey from folklore to pharmaceutical innovation.

Study Summary:
In modern times, medicine is predominantly based on evidence-based practices, whereas in ancient times, indigenous people relied on plant-based medicines with factual evidence documented in ancient books or folklore that demonstrated their effectiveness against specific infections. Plants and microbes account for 70% of drugs approved by the USFDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). Stilbenes, polyphenolic compounds synthesized by plants under stress conditions, have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential, bridging ancient wisdom with modern healthcare. Resveratrol, the most studied stilbene, initially discovered in grapes, red wine, peanuts, and blueberries, exhibits diverse pharmacological properties, including cardiovascular protection, antioxidant effects, anticancer activity, and neuroprotection. Traditional remedies, documented in ancient texts like the Ayurvedic Charak Samhita, foreshadowed the medicinal properties of stilbenes long before their modern scientific validation. Today, stilbenes are integral to the booming wellness and health supplement market, with resveratrol alone projected to reach a market value of 90 million US$ by 2025. However, challenges in stilbene production persist due to limited natural sources and costly extraction methods. Bioprospecting efforts reveal promising candidates for stilbene production, particularly endophytic fungi, which demonstrate high-yield capabilities and genetic modifiability. However, the identification of optimal strains and fermentation processes remains a critical consideration. The current review emphasizes the knowledge of the medicinal properties of Stilbenes (i.e., cardiovascular, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, etc.) isolated from plant and microbial sources, while also discussing strategies for their commercial production and future research directions. This also includes examples of novel stilbenes compounds reported from plant and endophytic fungi.
