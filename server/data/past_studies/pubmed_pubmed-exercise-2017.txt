Study Title: Progressive Multicomponent Intervention for Older Adults in Home Health Settings Following Hospitalization: Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Reduced physical function following hospitalization places older adults at risk of adverse health events. Many older adults receive home health physical therapy to reverse their deconditioning; however, optimal approaches to improve physical function are currently not known. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a home health care approach comprised of high-intensity exercise, enhanced care transition, and protein supplementation. Eligible participants included adults aged 65&#xa0;years or older referred to home health care following hospitalization. Two hundred older adults who are medically complex were enrolled and were randomized 1:1 to (1) a high-intensity progressive, multi-component (PMC) intervention or (2) enhanced usual care (UC) comparison group. All participants received 12 visits over 60&#xa0;days. The primary study outcome was change in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) from baseline to 60&#xa0;days. Secondary outcomes included gait speed (usual, fast), modified Physical Performance Test, grip strength, Fatigue Severity Scale, Falls Efficacy Scale-International, physical activity (step count), and adverse events (falls, emergency department visits, hospitalizations). All outcomes were collected at baseline, then 30, 60, 90, and 180 days post baseline. There was no difference in 60-day SPPB change between groups with both groups experiencing significant improvements (PMC&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.53 [95% CI: 1.00-2.05]; enhanced UC&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.39 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.89-1.88]). Differences were also not observed in secondary measures or adverse events at any time point. An intervention consisting of high-intensity exercise, enhanced care transition, and protein supplementation was not associated with greater functional improvement at 60&#xa0;days compared to enhanced UC in older adults receiving home health physical therapy. The findings of this study demonstrate that a high-intensity progressive, multi-component intervention results in similar physical functional changes as an enhanced UC intervention in older adults who are medically complex and receiving home health care following hospital-associated deconditioning.
