Study Title: Feasibility and Efficacy of a Brief Mindfulness-Based Smoking Intervention Deliveredthe Internet: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
A growing body of literature suggests that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing smoking. However, existing mindfulness interventions are often lengthy and require extensive interaction with a therapist, making them inaccessible to a large percentage of the population. The current study addressed this issue by testing the feasibility and efficacy of a single session, web-based, mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation.Participants (&#x2009;=&#x2009;80) took part in a fully online cue exposure exercise interspersed with brief instructions on how to cope with cravings for cigarettes. All participants were randomly assigned to receive either mindfulness-based or coping as usual instructions. Outcomes included participant satisfaction with the intervention, self-reported craving following the cue exposure exercise, and cigarette use 30&#x2009;days post-intervention.Participants in both groups found the instructions moderately helpful and easy to understand. Participants in the mindfulness group reported a significantly smaller increase in craving than those in the control group following the cue exposure exercise. Averaging across conditions, participants reported smoking fewer cigarettes in the 30&#x2009;days following the intervention than in the 30&#x2009;days prior, however there were no between group differences in cigarette use.Mindfulness-based interventions for smoking reduction can be effectively implemented in a brief, single-session online format. These interventions are easy to disseminate and can reach a large number of smokers with minimal participant burden. Results from the current study suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can help participants control craving in the face of smoking-related cues, although perhaps not change smoking quantity. Future research is needed to explore factors which may increase the efficacy of online, mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation, while still maintaining their accessibility and reach.
