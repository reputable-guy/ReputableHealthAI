Study Title: Acupoint massage at Shenque (CV 8) for chronic fatigue syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To observe the clinical efficacy of acupoint massage at Shenque (CV 8) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A total of 71 patients with CFS were randomized into an observation group (36 cases, 2 cases were eliminated, 3 cases dropped out) and a control group (35 cases). Using a specially made massage instrument, acupoint massage was adopted at the the five points of Shenque (CV 8), i.e. the center and the upper, lower, left, and right parts of the inner wall. The manipulation was given 10 min a time, once every 2 days, 3 times a week for 4 weeks continuously. No intervention was delivered in the control group. Before and after treatment, the scores of fatigue scale-14 (FS-14) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were observed, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated in the both groups. After treatment, the physical fatigue and mental fatigue scores, as well as the total score of FS-14 were decreased compared with those before treatment in the observation group (<0.001); the above scores in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (<0.001). After treatment, excepted for the sleep time and hypnotic scores, the remaining item scores and the total score of PSQI were decreased compared with those before treatment in the observation group (<0.05); the each item score and the total score of PSQI were lower than those in the control group (<0.05). The total effective rate in the observation group was superior to that in the control group (<0.01). Acupoint massage at Shenque (CV 8) can effectively improve the fatigue state and sleep quality in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
