Study Title: Exploring the feasibility of a cluster pilot randomised control trial to improve children's 24-hour movement behaviours and dietary intake: Happy homework.

Study Summary:
We aimed to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of Happy Homework (HH); an 8-week home-focussed intervention, with the purpose of encouraging children's positive dietary behaviours and engagement in positive physical activity (PA) and sleep behaviours. We randomised four Scottish schools (&#x2009;=&#x2009;71 participants; 5 classrooms) to either the HH intervention (&#x2009;=&#x2009;2) or usual curriculum control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;2). HH consisted of movement and dietary-focused parent and child tasks. Primary outcome measures were intervention feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy. Secondary outcomes were objectively measured PA via ActiGraph GT3X+, sedentary behaviours (SBs) and sleep duration via activPAL4&#x2122; accelerometers and dietary behaviours, fruit and vegetable consumption and screen-time via questionnaires. After controlling for pre-test levels, post intervention stepping time and sleep duration were significantly greater for the HH group in comparison to the control group. The HH group reported eating more fruit and vegetables at post-test than the control group. Participants also reported the intervention to be enjoyable and motivating. These findings provide promising evidence that given a greater sample size, better retention and the prioritisation of health and wellbeing homework, HH could enhance children's health and wellbeing.
