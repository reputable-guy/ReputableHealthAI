Study Title: Stronger Together: Group Self-Care Goal-Setting to Support Graduate Nursing Students' Resilience, Wellness, and Manage Burnout.

Study Summary:
Graduate students are faced with many stressors, including school, work, and home roles. They may not have the self-care skills and support to manage the increased stress from school. Self-care goal setting check-ins were implemented in a graduate course to support students' stress management. Student resilience levels, wellness, and burnout were moderate. Students indicated the check-ins were helpful, yet still found challenges in completing self-care. They also stated less assignments and integrating more wellness into the curriculum would be helpful in supporting their self-care goals. Nursing educators can impact student wellness by providing skills and support in the curriculum.
