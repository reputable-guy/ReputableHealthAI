Study Title: The acute effects of nonsleep deep rest on perceptual responses, physical, and cognitive performance in physically active participants.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to examine the effect of nonsleep deep rest (NSDR) on physical and cognitive performance, as well as sleepiness, acute readiness, recovery, stress, and mood state in physically active participants. A total of 65 physically active participants (42 male, 23 female) were randomly assigned into two groups: an experimental group (NSDR, n&#xa0;=&#x2009;34), in which participants completed a 10-min NSDR intervention, and a control group (CON, n&#xa0;=&#x2009;31), whereby participants sat passively for 10&#xa0;min. Testing measures were assessed immediately pre and 10&#xa0;min post each condition and comprised completing a hand grip strength dynamometer test and a countermovement jump test on force plates, cognitive function measures via a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT-B), and a Simon task test, along with four questionnaires to assess sleep, recovery, and mood state. A significant Group &#xd7; Time interaction favored the NSDR condition for handgrip strength, median reaction time during the PVT-B, and accuracy percentage during the Simon task. Questionnaire responses demonstrated NSDR to be associated with significant benefits to physical readiness, emotional balance, overall recovery, negative emotional state, overall stress, and tension in comparison to CON (p&#xa0;<&#x2009;.05). The NSDR intervention could be a valuable strategy for acutely enhancing overall well-being and readiness.
