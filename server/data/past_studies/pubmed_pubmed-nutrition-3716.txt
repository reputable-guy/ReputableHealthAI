Study Title: Effects of an Eating Pattern Including Colorful Fruits and Vegetables on Management of Gestational Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as abnormal glucose tolerance that presents during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, is a growing issue in the United States and worldwide. If left untreated or poorly controlled, GDM can result in numerous consequences for both the mother and the fetus; thus, it is imperative that different avenues of management for GDM be explored. There is a paucity of studies that examine how lifestyle changes, including dietary and physical activity, affect management of GDM. We examined how counseling on lifestyle changes can affect cardiometabolic risks in women with GDM. We conducted a 12-week randomized controlled trial based on behavioral counseling in which women with GDM (N = 38) were randomized into either a nutrition education (control) (N = 18) group or nutrition intervention (N = 20) group. The nutrition education group were given dietary counseling regarding healthy dietary choices based on USDA guidelines, while the nutrition intervention group were instructed to consume a total of one cup of whole berries and one cup of leafy vegetables daily along with performing postprandial exercise (walking). Blood samples, anthropometric measures, and dietary and physical activity data, recorded in daily food and activity logs, were collected at baseline and at the end of the study and compared between the two groups. Dietary counseling on supplementation with whole berries and leafy vegetables resulted in increased fiber intake, increased antioxidant intake and total serum antioxidant capacity, improved random blood glucose, decreased serum IL-6, and improved HDL cholesterol versus the control group (all< 0.05). These results highlight that whole berry and leafy vegetable supplementation-based dietary counseling can improve the metabolic pathways involved in gestational diabetes pathogenesis and prognosis. These functional foods must be recommended in the management of pregnancies affected by GDM.
