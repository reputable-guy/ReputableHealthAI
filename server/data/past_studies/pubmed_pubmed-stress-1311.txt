Study Title: A Group Parenting Intervention for Male Postpartum Depression: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Male postpartum depression is prevalent across populations; however, there is limited evidence on strategies to address it, particularly in low-income settings. To evaluate the effectiveness of Learning Through Play Plus Dads (LTP&#x2009;+&#x2009;Dads), a nonspecialist-delivered psychosocial intervention, in improving symptoms of male postpartum depression compared to treatment as usual. This cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, between June 2018 and November 2019. Assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Participants were recruited from 2 large towns in the city of Karachi via basic health units. Fathers aged 18 years and older with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive episode and a child younger than 30 months were recruited. Of 1582 fathers approached, 1527 were screened and 357 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention or treatment as usual; 328 were included in the final analysis. Data were analyzed from April to June 2022. LTP&#x2009;+&#x2009;Dads is a manualized intervention combining parenting skills training, play therapy, and cognitive behavior therapy. The intervention was delivered by community health workers via 12 group sessions over 4 months. The primary outcome was change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score at 4 months. Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms; parenting stress; intimate partner violence; functioning; quality of life; and child social, emotional, and physical health outcomes. Assessments were completed at baseline and 4 and 6 months postrandomization. Of the 357 fathers included (mean [SD] age, 31.44 [7.24] years), 171 were randomized to the intervention and 186 to treatment as usual. Participants randomized to the intervention demonstrated significantly greater improvements in depression (group difference ratio [GDR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.91; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), anxiety (GDR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.81; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), parenting stress (GDR, -12.5; 95% CI, -19.1 to -6.0; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), intimate partner violence (GDR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.00; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.05), disability (GDR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.97; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03), and health-related quality of life (GDR, 12.7; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.34; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) at 4 months. The difference in depression and parenting stress was sustained at 6 months. Children of fathers randomized to the parenting intervention had significantly greater improvements in social-emotional development scores (mean difference, -20.8; 95% CI, -28.8 to -12.9; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) at 6 months. The psychosocial parenting intervention in this study has the potential to improve paternal mental health and child development in Pakistan. Further studies in other populations and with longer follow-up are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03564847.
