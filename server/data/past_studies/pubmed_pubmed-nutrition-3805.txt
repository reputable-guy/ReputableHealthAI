Study Title: Feeding Practices and Dietary Diversity in the First Year of Life: PreventADALL, a Scandinavian Randomized Controlled Trial and Birth Cohort Study.

Study Summary:
Breastmik is considered the optimal source of nutrition in early infancy. However, recommendations and practices for when and how complementary food should be introduced in the first year of life vary worldwide. Early introduction of allergenic foods may prevent food allergies, but if early food introduction influences infant feeding practices is less known. We sought to assess infant feeding practices in the first year of life and to determine if early interventional food introduction influences breastfeeding and dietary diversity. Dietary intake was assessed in infants from the population-based clinical trial Preventing Atopic Dermatitis and ALLergies (PreventADALL) in children study. A total of 2397 infants were cluster-randomized at birth into 4 different groups: 1) control, 2) skin intervention, 3) introduction to 4 allergenic foods between 3 and 4 mo of age: peanut, cow milk, wheat, and egg, as small tastings until 6 mo, and 4) combined skin and food interventions. Dietary data were available from at least one of the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-mo questionnaires in 2059 infants. In the present analysis, groups 1 and 2 constitute the No Food Intervention group, whereas groups 3 and 4 constitute the Food Intervention group. We used the log-rank test and Cox regression to assess the impact of food intervention on age of breastfeeding cessation. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to compare dietary diversity, defined as the number of food categories consumed, between intervention groups. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo, 95%, 88%, 67%, and 51% were breastfed, respectively, and breastfeeding duration was not affected by the food intervention. In the No Food Intervention group, mean age of complementary food introduction was 18.3 wk (confidence interval [CI]: 18.1, 18.5). In the Food Intervention group, the dietary diversity score was 1.39 units (CI: 1.16, 1.62) higher at 9 mo (P < 0.001) and 0.7 units (CI: 0.5, 0.9) higher at 12 mo (P < 0.001) compared to the No Food Intervention group. Early food intervention did not affect breastfeeding rates and increased dietary diversity at 9 and 12 mo.
