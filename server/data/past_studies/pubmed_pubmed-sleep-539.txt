Study Title: Efficacy of Olokizumab against Comorbid Depressive Disorder in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Preliminary Results of the Study.

Study Summary:
Interleukin (IL) 6 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression comorbid with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and IL-6 inhibitors used to treat patients with RA may have an antidepressant effect. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Russian iIL-6 olokizumab (OKZ) in reducing symptoms of depression in patients with moderate/high RA activity. To date, 49 RA patients have been included, of which 43 (87.7%) are women, with an average age of 47.8 &#xb1; 12.8 years; with a predominant high activity of RA according to DAS28 (CRP) indices (89.8%), SDAI (79.6%) and CDAI (75.5%) and inefficacy of stable 12-week therapy with &#x441;DMARDs. In all patients, a psychiatrist, in accordance with ICD-10, diagnosed depression (chronic or recurrent) of varying severity during a semi-structured interview. At week 0, all patients were randomized by the method of sequential numbers in a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 to one of the three study groups: group 1-cDMARDs + OKZ 64&#xa0;mg subcutaneously once every 4 weeks (n = 18); group 2-cDMARDs + OKZ 64&#xa0;mg subcutaneously once every 4 weeks + psychopharmacotherapy (PPT) (n = 26); group&#xa0;3-cDMARDs + PPT (n = 5). The duration of the study is 24&#xa0;weeks. The&#xa0;dynamics of depression severity was assessed on the PHQ-9, MADRS scales; anxiety, on HAM-A; experimental psychological projective techniques were also used. After 12 and 24 weeks of therapy, there was a significant decrease in the severity of&#xa0;depression and anxiety in all groups of patients. However, the difference between the final and initial values of all scales was statistically significantly greater (p <0.05) in the groups of patients receiving PPT: cDMARDs + OKZ + PPT (&#x394;= -6.75 &#xb1; 3.91; &#x394;= -22.5 &#xb1; 4.83; &#x394;= -14.6 &#xb1; 5.37) and cDMARDs + PPT (&#x394;= -15.5 &#xb1; 3.53; &#x394;= -25.0 &#xb1; 1.41; &#x394;= -18.5 &#xb1; 3.53), compared with the cDMARDs + OKZ group (&#x394;= -4.00 &#xb1; 3.89; &#x394;= -5.75 &#xb1; 8.29; &#x394;= -8.50 &#xb1; 8.21). According to a semi-structured interview with a psychiatrist and design experimental psychological techniques, the proportion of patients without depression after 24&#xa0;weeks of therapy was significantly higher in the groups of patients receiving PPT: 90% in&#xa0;the group of cDMARDs + OKZ + PPT and 100%-cDMARDs + PPT, as opposed to 25% in the group of cDMARDs + OKZ. OKZ therapy contributed to the normalization of night sleep but did not lead to a decrease in the frequency and severity of cognitive disorders (CDs). OKZ has an antidepressant effect, leads to a decrease in the frequency of sleep disorders. However, a complete regression of depression symptoms when OKZ is prescribed without PPT is possible only in 25% of RA patients, mainly in the patients with mild depression. A combination of OKZ and PPT is optimal for the complete regression of depression and anxiety and a decrease in the frequency and severity of&#xa0;CDs.
