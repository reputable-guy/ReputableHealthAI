Study Title: Moderate-Duration Dynamic Stretching During Warm-up Improves Running Economy and Running Performance in Recreational Distance Runners.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to investigate, in distance runners, the acute effects of moderate durations (60&#xa0;s per leg) of static (SS) and dynamic stretching (DS) on running economy (RE) and performance. Twelve recreational runners completed a randomized crossover design. Initially, the second ventilatory threshold (VT2) and the speed associated with the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) (vVO2max) were determined through an incremental test. Then, participants completed submaximal continuous-running (75%VT2 and 85%VT2) and running-until-exhaustion (vVO2max) tests preceded by 3 warm-ups: running plus SS or DS (SS or DS conditions) and running without stretching (NS condition). The&#xa0;SS and DS conditions consisted of 5&#xa0;minutes of running plus 10&#xa0;minutes of SS or DS, respectively, and the&#xa0;NS condition consisted of 15&#xa0;minutes of running without stretching. RE at 75%VT2 and 85%VT2, time to exhaustion, and total running distance were evaluated. Rating of perceived exertion was also assessed. Running economy at&#xa0;75%VT2 resulted significantly better in the DS than in the&#xa0;NS (P < .001) and in the SS (P < .05). Time to exhaustion and total running distance were significantly improved in DS compared with NS (P < .001) and SS (P < .01). No differences in rating of perceived exertion among conditions were found. Our results showed that, in recreational distance runners, a preexercise moderate-duration bout of DS improved RE and enhanced total running distance and time to exhaustion, whereas 60&#xa0;seconds of SS did not induce significant improvements. Overall, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of moderate DS durations in optimizing RE and performance parameters, showing that such effects depend on the stretching modality used.
