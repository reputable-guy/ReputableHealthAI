Study Title: Admission rates in a general practitioner-based versus a hospital specialist based, hospital-at-home model: ACCESS, an open-labelled randomised clinical trial of effectiveness.

Study Summary:
Hospital at home (HaH) is an alternative to acute admission for elderly patients. It is unclear if should be cared for a primarily by a hospital intern specialist or by the patient's own general practitioner (GP). The study assessed whether a GP based model was more effective than a hospital specialist based model at reducing number of hospital admissions without affecting the patient's recovery or number of deaths. Pragmatic, randomised, open-labelled multicentre parallel group trial with two arms in four municipalities, four emergency departments and 150 GPs in Southern Denmark, including +&#x2009;65&#xa0;years old patients with an acute medical condition that required acute hospital in-patient care. The patients were randomly assigned to hospital specialist based model or GP model of HaH care. Five physical and cognitive performance tests were performed at inclusion and after 7&#xa0;days. Primary outcome was number of hospital admissions within 7&#xa0;days. Secondary outcomes were number of admissions within 14, 21 and 30&#xa0;days, deaths within 30 and 90&#xa0;days and changes in performance tests. Sixty seven patients were enrolled in the GP model and 64 in the hospital specialist model. 45% in the hospital specialist arm versus 24% in the GP arm were admitted within 7&#xa0;days (effect size 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.8; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and this remained significant within 30&#xa0;days. No differences were found in death or changes in performance tests from day 0-7&#xa0;days between the two groups. The GP based HaH model was more effective than the hospital specialist model in avoiding hospital admissions within 7&#xa0;days among elderly patients with an acute medical condition with no differences in mental or physical recovery rates or deaths between the two models.
