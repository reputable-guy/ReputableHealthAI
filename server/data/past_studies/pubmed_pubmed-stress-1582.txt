Study Title: Anxiolytic, Antidepression, and Memory-Enhancing Effects of the Novel Instant Soup RJ6601 in the Middle-Aged of Female Rats.

Study Summary:
Due to the health benefits of polyphenols and dietary fiber in combating mental disorders, we hypothesized that a polyphenol- and dietary fiber-enriched soup (RJ6601) would improve mental wellness in a rat model of middle-aged women. To test this hypothesis, female Wistar rats aged 18 months (350-450 g) were orally administered RJ6601 at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg BW for 28 days. The anxiolytic, antidepression, and memory-enhancing effects were assessed every 7 days throughout the study period. The neuron density and levels of activities of AChE, total MAO, MAO-A, MAO-B, MDA, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, and BDNF in the prefrontal cortex at the end of study were also investigated. Furthermore, the amounts ofspp. andspp. in their feces were also determined. The results revealed that the developed soup shows anxiolytic, antidepression, and memory-enhancing effects. An increased neuron density; reductions in AChE, total MAO, MAO-A, MAO-B, and MDA; and an elevation of serum BDNF, together with increased amounts of both bacterial species in feces, were also observed. Our results suggest that RJ6601 is a potential mental wellness promotion supplement that enhances BDNF levels, brain plasticity, neurotransmitter balance, and oxidative stress and inflammation status, along with improving microbiota.
