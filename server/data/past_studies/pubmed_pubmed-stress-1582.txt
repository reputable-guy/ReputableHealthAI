Study Title: Revitalising Riboflavin: Unveiling Its Timeless Significance in Human Physiology and Health.

Study Summary:
Since the early twentieth century, research on vitamins has revealed their therapeutic potential beyond their role as essential micronutrients. Riboflavin, known as vitamin B2, stands out for its unique characteristics. Despite numerous studies, riboflavin remains vital, with implications for human health. Abundantly present in various foods, riboflavin acts as a coenzyme in numerous enzymatic reactions crucial for human metabolism. Its role in energy production, erythrocyte synthesis, and vitamin metabolism underscores its importance in maintaining homeostasis. The impact of riboflavin extends to neurological function, skin health, and cardiovascular well-being, with adequate levels linked to reduced risks of various ailments. However, inadequate intake or physiological stress can lead to deficiency, a condition that poses serious health risks, including severe complications. This underscores the importance of maintaining sufficient levels of riboflavin for general wellness. The essential role of riboflavin in immune function further emphasises its significance for human health and vitality. This paper examines the diverse effects of riboflavin on health and stresses the importance of maintaining sufficient levels for overall well-being.
