Study Title: Exogenous ketone salts do not improve cognitive responses after a high-intensity exercise protocol in healthy college-aged males.

Study Summary:
This study examined the effects of a d-&#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate (&#x3b2;HB) containing beverage on cognitive and performance measures during a bout of repeated Wingates. Fifteen healthy, college-aged males (mean &#xb1; SD; age: 23.1 &#xb1; 2.4 years, height: 165.4 &#xb1; 2.0 cm, mass: 81.4 &#xb1; 9.2 kg) volunteered for the present study. Trial 1 consisted of baseline measures and familiarization for the protocol. During trials 2 and 3, subjects reported to the laboratory, after a 10-h fast, and ingested 11.38 g of &#x3b2;HB or a placebo (PLA) beverage 30 min before exercise. Participants then completed a cognitive challenge (CC), consisting of a 5-min FitLight response task while cycling. At the cessation of the test, participants then completed four 15-s repeated Wingates with 4 min of rest between, followed by another 5-min CC response task. Blood ketones, glucose, and lactate were measured pre-CC and post-Wingates. &#x3b2;HB levels were significantly higher compared with PLA (0.53 vs. 0.21 mmol/L), respectively. A significant order effect was observed across trials 2 and 3 for total FitLight misses and hits, regardless of treatment. Further, there were no significant differences among Wingate power output between treatments, although fatigue index was higher in the &#x3b2;HB group compared with PLA (32.3 vs. 29.4 W/s), respectively. In conclusion, &#x3b2;HB did not improve high-intensity cycling or cognitive performance measures; however, these findings might be partially explained by the absolute dosing protocol used for &#x3b2;HB in the present study as opposed to a relative (g/kg) dosing protocol used in previous research.
