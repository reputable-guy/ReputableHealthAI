Study Title: Biological sex as a tailoring variable for exercise prescription in hospitalized older adults.

Study Summary:
Sex-based differences in the clinical presentation and outcomes are well-established in patients hospitalized for geriatric syndromes. We aimed to investigate sex differences in response to in-hospital exercise on function, strength, cognition, and quality of life in acute care admissions. 570 patients (mean age 87 years, 298 females [52.3%]) admitted to acute care for elderly units were randomized to multicomponent exercise emphasizing progressive resistance training or usual care. Functional assessments included Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), grip strength, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and health-related quality of life (EQ-VAS). Exercising females showed more significant SPPB improvements than males (between-group difference 1.48 points, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027), exceeding the minimal clinically significant difference. While female participants significantly increased handgrip strength and male patients improved cognition after in-hospital exercise compared to the control group (all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), no sex differences occurred. Females demonstrate more excellent physical function improvements compared to male older patients. Findings highlight the importance of tailored exercise incorporating patient factors like biological sex in geriatric medicine. NCT04600453.
