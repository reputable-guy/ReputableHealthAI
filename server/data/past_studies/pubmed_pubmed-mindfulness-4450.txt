Study Title: A Pilot Open Trial of a Digital Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Anorexia Nervosa.

Study Summary:
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric disorder. Unfortunately, current treatments are lacking, with only 30-50% of individuals with AN recovering after treatment. We developed a beta-version of a digital mindfulness-based intervention for AN called Mindful Courage-Beta, which includes: (a) one foundational multimedia module; (b) 10 daily meditation mini-modules; (c) emphasis on a core skill set called the BOAT (Breathe, Observe, Accept, Take a Moment); and (d) brief phone coaching for both technical and motivational support. In this open trial, we aimed to evaluate (1) acceptability and feasibility; (2) intervention skill use and its association with state mindfulness in daily life; and (3) pre-to-post changes in target mechanisms and outcomes. Eighteen individuals with past-year AN or past-year atypical AN completed Mindful Courage-Beta over 2 weeks. Participants completed measures of acceptability, trait mindfulness, emotion regulation, eating disorder symptoms, and body dissatisfaction. Participants also completed ecological momentary assessment of skill use and state mindfulness. Acceptability ratings were good (ease-of-use: 8.2/10, helpfulness: 7.6/10). Adherence was excellent (100% completion for foundational module and 96% for mini-modules). Use of the BOAT in daily life was high (1.8 times/day) and was significantly associated with higher state mindfulness at the within-person level. We also found significant, large improvements in the target mechanisms of trait mindfulness (d&#x202f;=&#x202f;.96) and emotion regulation (d&#x202f;=&#x202f;.76), as well as significant, small-medium to medium-large reductions in eating disorder symptoms (ds&#x202f;=&#x202f;.36-.67) and body dissatisfaction (d&#x202f;=&#x202f;.60). Changes in trait mindfulness and emotion regulation had medium-large size correlations with changes in global ED symptoms and body dissatisfaction (rs&#x202f;=&#x202f;.43 - .56). Mindful Courage-Beta appears to be promising and further research on a longer, refined version is warranted.
