Study Title: The Impact of Ascidian (Halocynthia roretzi)-derived Plasmalogen on Cognitive Function in Healthy Humans: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Plasmalogen, phospholipids with previously shown associations with dementia, has attracted attention as a substance found in some studies to improve cognitive function. The effects of ascidian-derived plasmalogens on cognitive performance improvement were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study including Japanese adult volunteers with mild forgetfulness. Participants consumed either the active food containing ascidian-derived plasmalogen (1 mg as plasmalogen) or the placebo food for 12 weeks, and their cognitive performance was assessed by Cognitrax. Participants were randomly allocated into the intervention (ascidian-derived plasmalogen; 8 males, and 17 females; 45.6 &#xb1; 11.1 years) or the placebo (9 males, and 15 females; mean age, 46.4 &#xb1; 10.8 years) group. Compared to the placebo group, the intervention group showed a significant increase score in composite memory (eight weeks: 3.0 &#xb1; 16.3 points, 12 weeks: 6.7 &#xb1; 17.5 points), which was defined as the sum of verbal and visual memory scores. These results indicate the consumption of ascidian-derived plasmalogen maintains and enhances memory function. This study was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN-CTR, registry no. UMIN000026297). This study did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
