Study Title: Evaluating the Impact of Post-Esophagectomy Exercise on 2- and 5-Yr Survival: Findings from the PERFECT Trial.

Study Summary:
Despite recent treatment advances, esophageal cancer still has poor survival and a high morbidity. Exploratory evidence suggests that exercise can reduce cancer-related mortality and recurrence rates. Here, we investigated the effects of an exercise intervention in the first year after esophagectomy on survival in participants of the Physical ExeRcise Following Esophageal Cancer Treatment (PERFECT) trial. In the PERFECT trial, esophageal cancer patients who had undergone esophagectomy were randomized to a 12-wk exercise program (EX) or the control group (CG). We assessed 2- and 5-yr (progression-free) survival. (Un)adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for comparison between the trial arms. Sensitivity analyses, excluding patients with events within the exercise intervention period, were performed. In total, 120 participants (EX = 61; CG = 59) were included in the PERFECT trial. After 2-yr follow-up, no significant difference in the risk of death or progression between EX and CG was found (adjusted HR = 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-3.63) and 1.38 (95% CI, 0.76-2.50), respectively). After excluding patients with events during the intervention period (EX = 8; CG = 4), 2-yr HRs for death (1.03; 95% CI, 0.41-2.56) and progression (1.26; 95% CI, 0.64-2.48) both decreased and remained insignificant. No significant effects were found on 5-yr mortality (1.03; 95% CI, 0.57-1.84) and progression (1.21; 95% CI, 0.72-2.04) either. Sensitivity analysis resulted in attenuated 5-yr HRs for mortality (0.82; 95% CI, 0.42-1.58) and progression (1.08; 95% CI, 0.61-1.92). The results indicate no benefit of a 12-wk exercise program in the first year post-esophagectomy on 2- and 5-yr (progression-free) survival in esophageal cancer patients. The absence of beneficial effects may be explained by the relatively short exercise program, which was performed after treatment completion.
