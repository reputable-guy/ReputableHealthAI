Study Title: [Effectiveness of Anvifen in the treatment of insomnia in elderly patients].

Study Summary:
Purpose of the study to determine the effectiveness of Anvifen in the case of insomnia and meteosensitivity as comorbid stress-induced disorders. 67 patients aged 60-70 years were examined, who were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 - 33 patients (20 men, 13 women), group 2 - 34 patients (19 men, 15 women). The average age of group 1 was 62.7 [61; 65] years, group 2 was 63.1 [60; 66] years (=0.28). Research methods: questionnaire for scoring subjective characteristics of sleep, assessing the influence of meteosensitivity on daily activity using a numerical rank scale (NRS) for the previous three months. Patients in group 1 took Anvifen 250 mg (capsules) in the morning and afternoon, 500 mg (2 capsules) in the evening at 10 p.m., and upon awakening at night - an additional 250 mg of the drug per capsule. Patients in group 2 took Anvifen powder (extracting it from the capsule) 250 mg in the morning and afternoon, 500 mg in the evening at 10 p.m., and upon awakening at night - an additional 250 mg of the drug. The time from the nightly intake of Anvifen to the onset of sleep was also assessed on a three-degree scale: &#xab;fast&#xbb;, &#xab;long&#xbb;, &#xab;very long&#xbb;. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks. Baseline results of measured parameters did not differ significantly between groups. After completion of treatment, the total score of subjective sleep characteristics improved in 1(=0.00001) and 2(=0.000001) groups. Significant differences from group 1 for the better in group 2 were in &#xab;quality of sleep&#xbb; (=0.00027) and &#xab;quality of awakening&#xbb; (=0.00001). Weather sensitivity decreased in 1(=0.00001) and 2(=0.000001) groups. Anvifen showed good effectiveness in the treatment of two comorbid conditions of elderly people - insomnia and meteosensitivity. Using the drug in powder form allows you to get a faster and better effect without side-effects.
