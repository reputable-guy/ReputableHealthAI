Study Title: Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia for untreated hypertension with comorbid insomnia disorder: The SLEEPRIGHT clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Insomnia and poor sleep are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its precursors, including hypertension. In 2022, the American Heart Association (AHA) added inadequate sleep to its list of health behaviors that increase the risk for CVD. It remains unknown, however, whether the successful treatment of insomnia and inadequate sleep can reduce heightened CVD risk. SLEEPRIGHT is a single-site, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate whether the successful treatment of insomnia results in improved markers of CVD risk in patients with untreated hypertension and comorbid insomnia disorder. Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;150) will undergo baseline assessments, followed by a 6-week run-in period after which they will receive cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), comprised of 6 hourly sessions with an experienced CBT-I therapist over a 6-week period. In addition to measures of insomnia severity, as well as both subjective and objective measures of sleep, the primary outcome measures are nighttime blood pressure (BP) and BP dipping assessed by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Secondary outcomes include several CVD risk biomarkers, including clinic BP, lipid profile, vascular endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Data analysis will evaluate the association between improvements in insomnia and sleep with primary and secondary CVD risk biomarker outcomes. The SLEEPRIGHT trial (ClinicalTrials.Gov NCT04009447) will utilize CBT-I, the current gold standard treatment for insomnia disorder, to evaluate whether reducing insomnia severity and improving sleep are accompanied by improved biomarkers of CVD risk in patients with untreated hypertension.
