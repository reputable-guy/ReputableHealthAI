Study Title: Long-term effects of an egg-protein hydrolysate on cognitive performance and brain vascular function: a double-blind randomized controlled trial in adults with elevated subjective cognitive failures.

Study Summary:
Short-term intake of the egg-protein hydrolysate Newtricious (NWT)-03 improved executive function, but underlying mechanisms and long-term effects, including other cognitive domains, are unknown. A 36-week randomized controlled trial involving 44 overweight/obese individuals experiencing elevated Subjective Cognitive Failures (SCF; aged 60-75&#xa0;years) assessed the impact of daily consumption of 5.7&#xa0;g of NWT-03 or placebo powders on cognitive performance (psychomotor speed, executive function, memory) and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF), a marker of brain vascular function. Cognitive performance was evaluated using a neurophysiological test battery (CANTAB) and CBF was measured using magnetic resonance imaging perfusion method Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). Serum samples were collected to determine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. Anthropometrics, and energy and nutrient intakes remained stable throughout the trial. NWT-03 was well tolerated, and compliance was excellent (median: 99%; range: 87-103%). No overall intervention effects were observed on cognitive performance or CBF, but post-hoc analyses revealed significant improvements on executive function in women, but not men. Specifically, a reduction of 74&#xa0;ms in reaction latency on the multitasking task (95% CI: -134 to -15; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), a reduction of 9 between errors (95%CI: -14 to -3; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and a reduction of 9 total errors (95%CI: -15 to -3; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) on the spatial working memory task were found in women. No intervention effects were observed on serum BDNF concentrations (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31). Long-term consumption of NWT-03 improved multitasking abilities and working memory in women with elevated SCF. Brain vascular function remained unaffected. Sex differences in executive function require additional clarification.
