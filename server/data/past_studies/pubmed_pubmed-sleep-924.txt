Study Title: Training stress, neuromuscular fatigue and well-being in volleyball: a systematic review.

Study Summary:
Volleyball, with its unique calendar structure, presents distinct challenges in training and competition scheduling. Like many team sports, volleyball features an unconventional schedule with brief off-season and pre-season phases, juxtaposed against an extensive in-season phase characterized by a high density of matches and training. This compact calendar necessitates careful management of training loads and recovery periods. The effectiveness of this management is a critical factor, influencing the overall performance and success of volleyball teams. In this review, we explore the associations between training stress measures, fatigue, and well-being assessments within this context, to better inform future research and practice. A systematic literature search was conducted in databases including PsycINFO, MEDLINE/PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria were original research papers published in peer-reviewed journals involving volleyball athletes. Of the 2535 studies identified, 31 were thoroughly analysed. From these 31 articles, 22 included professional athletes, seven included collegiate-level volleyball athletes, and two included young athletes. Nine studies had female volleyball players, while the remaining 22 had male volleyball athletes. Internal training load should be collected daily after training sessions and matches with the session rating of perceived exertion method. External training load should also be measured daily according to the methods based on jump height, jump count, and kinetic energy. If force platforms are available, neuromuscular fatigue can be assessed weekly using the FT:CT ratio of a countermovement jump or, in cases where force platforms are not available, the average jump height can also be used. Finally, the Hooper Index has been shown to be a measure of overall wellness, fatigue, stress, muscle soreness, mood, and sleep quality in volleyball when used daily.
