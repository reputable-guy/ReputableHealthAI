Study Title: Serum &#x3b2;2-Microglobulin Predicts Time to Recovery of Delayed Graft Function in Kidney Transplant Recipients.

Study Summary:
Delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation is associated with adverse patients and allograft outcomes. A longer duration of DGF is predictive of worse graft outcomes compared to a shorter duration. Posttransplant serum &#x3b2;2-microglobulin (B2M) is associated with long-term graft outcomes, but its relationship with DGF recovery is unknown. We included all kidney-only transplant recipients with DGF enrolled in the E-DGF trial. Duration of DGF was defined as the interval between the transplant and the last dialysis session. We analyzed the association of standardized serum creatinine (Scr) and B2M on postoperative Days (POD) 1-7 during the subsequent days of DGF with the recovery of DGF. A total of 97 recipients with DGF were included. The mean duration of DGF was 11.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;11.2 days. Higher Scr was not associated with the duration of DGF in unadjusted or adjusted models. Higher standardized B2M, in contrast, was associated with a prolonged duration of DGF. This association remained in models adjusting for baseline characteristics from POD 2 (3.19 days longer, 95% CI: 0.46-5.93; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) through Day 6 of DGF (4.97 days longer, 95% CI: 0.75-9.20; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02). There was minimal change in mean Scr (0.01&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0. 10&#xa0;mg/dL per day; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.32), while B2M significantly decreased as the time to recovery approached (-0.14&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.05&#xa0;mg/L per day; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006), among recipients with DGF. B2M is more strongly associated with DGF recovery than Scr. Posttransplant B2M may be an important biomarker to monitor during DGF. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03864926.
