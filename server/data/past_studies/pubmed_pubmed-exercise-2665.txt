Study Title: Acute exercise might not affect subsequent appetite responses to a fixed meal in adolescents with obesity: The SMASH exploratory study.

Study Summary:
While an intensity-dependent post-exercise decrease in energy intake (EI) has been described in adolescents with obesity, studies invariably used ad libitum meals, limiting then any conclusions regarding the effect of exercise on post-meal appetitive responses that can be also impacted by the ad libitum nature of the meal. This study analyses appetite and food-reward related responses to a fixed meal after an acute exercise, also exploring the associations between substrate use during exercise and overall daily EI in adolescents with obesity. Thirteen adolescents with obesity (12-16 years, 5 males) randomly complete 2 experimental sessions: (i) a control condition (CON); (ii) a 30-min moderate intensity (65% VO) cycling condition (EX). Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured during both 30&#xa0;min of rest (CON) or exercise (EX). Ad libitum EI, macronutrient intake and relative EI were assessed at dinner, subjective appetite sensations taken at regular intervals and food reward measured before and after lunch as well as before dinner. Energy and macronutrient intake did not differ between conditions, as well as appetite feelings. A time effect (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.012) was observed between pre and post meal for choice fat bias in both conditions but was only significant within the CON condition (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004). CHO oxidation during exercise was found correlated with both EI (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.586, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.045), pre-lunch hunger (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.624, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030), daily AUC for hunger and DTE (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.788, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002 and r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.695; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.012 respectively). This exploratory study highlights that acute exercise might not affect subsequent appetite responses when using a fixed test meal in adolescents with obesity.
