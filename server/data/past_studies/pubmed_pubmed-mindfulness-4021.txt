Study Title: "Optimizing Wellness and Neurorehabilitation with Mindfulness (OWNMindfulness)": feasibility of a novel mindfulness-based rehabilitation intervention for Persisting Symptoms after Concussion.

Study Summary:
Persisting Symptoms after Concussion (PSaC) are common and difficult to treat. Mindfulness-based interventions can support recovery but are rarely included in rehabilitative care. We developed, an eight-week live-video mindfulness-based group for PSaC. To assess feasibility and preliminary clinical effects of Fourteen individuals with PSaC enrolled in this mixed-methods single-arm feasibility study. We assessed enrollment/retention, adherence, fidelity, instrument completion, safety, and satisfaction. We evaluated preliminary trends in the impact of the intervention on mindfulness (CAMS-R), concussion symptoms (PCSS), and QOL (WHOQOL-BREF). Qualitative analysis of exit interviews explored participants' perceptions of the effects of the intervention, and framework analysis assessed adequacy of the quantitative measures to capture perceived effects. Feasibility results met a priori benchmarks. Mindfulness, concussion symptoms, and QOL scores improved (CAMS-R:&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01, large effect size; PCSS:&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03, moderate effect size; WHOQOL-BREF: not significant, small effect size). Qualitative analysis of interview data found benefits including validation, compassion, self-awareness, self-efficacy, concussion symptoms, resilience, life participation, social relationships, and QOL. Framework analysis demonstrated that quantitative tools captured change in concussion symptoms but did not comprehensively assess the other benefits identified through qualitative methods. shows preliminary feasibility and promise for improving clinical outcomes. Results suggest the need for additional quantitative tools for comprehensive measurement of the effects and may point to potential mechanisms of action.
