Study Title: High-intensity interval exercise improves cognitive performance and reduces matrix metalloproteinases-2 serum levels in persons with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Aerobic exercise can improve cognitive performance in healthy elderly people. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a 3-week high-intensity aerobic exercise programme (high-intensity training group (HIT)) on cognitive performance in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with a standard exercise programme (control training (CT)). A total of 60 persons with MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 1.0-6.5) were randomized to a HIT group (3&#xd7;/week for 20&#x2009;minutes, including five 3-minute exercise intervals at 80% of peak oxygen uptake (VO)) or a CT group (continuously 5&#xd7;/week for 30&#x2009;minutes/session at 65% of VO). Cognitive performance was assessed using the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS at entry ( t) and discharge ( t). Furthermore, VO, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, serotonin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9 were measured. Compared to CT, HIT significantly improved verbal memory. Significant improvements over time in executive functions were found in both groups. Secondary outcomes indicated significant improvements in VOand a significant reduction in MMP-2 in the HIT group only. HIT represents a promising strategy to improve verbal memory and physical fitness in persons with MS. Further research is needed to determine the impact of exercise on biomarkers in MS.
