Study Title: Dietary Supplementation with an Extract of(Lemon verbena) Improves Sleep Quality in Healthy Subjects: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Seventy-one healthy subjects with sleep disturbances participated in a randomized, double-blind controlled trial in which dietary supplementation with an extract of(lemon verbena) (= 33) or placebo (= 38) was administered for 90 days. There were between-group differences in favor of the experimental group in the visual analogue scale (VAS) for sleep quality (6.5 &#xb1; 1.6 vs. 5.5 &#xb1; 2.1,= 0.021) as well as in the overall score (5.8 &#xb1; 2.4,= 0.008) and scores for sleep latency (1.6 &#xb1; 1.0 vs. 1.9 &#xb1; 0.7,= 0.027) and sleep efficiency (84.5 &#xb1; 12.8 vs. 79.8 &#xb1; 13.6,= 0.023) in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep-related variables (latency, efficiency, wakefulness after sleep onset, awakenings) assessed by actigraphy also showed better scores in the experimental group (= 0.001). Plasma nocturnal melatonin levels also increased significantly in the experimental group (199.7 &#xb1; 135.3 vs. 174.7 &#xb1; 115.4 pg/mL,= 0.048). Changes in anthropometric parameters and physical activity levels were not found. In summary, a dietary supplement of lemon verbena administered for 3 months was associated with a significant improvement in sleep quality as compared with placebo in a population of healthy subjects with sleep problems.
