Study Title: Improving Neurological Health in Aging Via Neuroplasticity-Based Computerized Exercise: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Our current understanding of how computerized brain training drives cognitive and functional benefits remains incomplete. This paper describes the protocol for Improving Neurological Health in Aging via Neuroplasticity-based Computerized Exercise (INHANCE), a randomized controlled trial in healthy older adults designed to evaluate whether brain training improves cholinergic signaling. INHANCE evaluates whether 2 computerized training programs alter acetylcholine binding using the vesicular acetylcholine transporter ligand [18F] fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18F] FEOBV) and positron emission tomography (PET). In this phase IIb, prospective, double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled randomized trial, a minimum of 92 community-dwelling healthy adults aged 65 years and older are randomly assigned to a brain training program designed using the principles of neuroplasticity (BrainHQ by Posit Science) or to an active control program of computer games designed for entertainment (eg, Solitaire). Both programs consist of 30-minute sessions, 7 times per week for 10 weeks (35 total hours), completed remotely at home using either loaned or personal devices. The primary outcome is the change in FEOBV binding in the anterior cingulate cortex, assessed at baseline and posttest. Exploratory cognitive and behavioral outcomes sensitive to acetylcholine are evaluated before, immediately after, and 3 months following the intervention to assess the maintenance of observed effects. The trial was funded in September 2019. The study received approval from the Western Institutional Review Board in October 2020 with Research Ethics Board of McGill University Health Centre and Health Canada approvals in June 2021. The trial is currently ongoing. The first participant was enrolled in July 2021, enrollment closed when 93 participants were randomized in December 2023, and the trial will conclude in June 2024. The study team will be unblinded to conduct analyses after the final participant exits the study. We expect to publish the results in the fourth quarter of 2024. There remains a critical need to identify effective and scalable nonpharmaceutical interventions to enhance cognition in older adults. This trial contributes to our understanding of brain training by providing a potential neurochemical explanation of cognitive benefit.
