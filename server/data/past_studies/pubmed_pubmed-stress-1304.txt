Study Title: Venipuncture in pediatric emergency department by using Koala Attachment Distraction method: Randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To assess, compare and relate the toddler's pain and anxiety during venipuncture by using either the Koala Attachment Distraction method or the physical restraint method and to evaluate the level of anxiety perceived by the companions in both groups. Randomised, single-blind, controlled clinical trial in two arms (control and intervention group) conducted in the paediatric emergency department of a tertiary university hospital. The study variables were pain and stress of the child and anxiety perceived by the accompanying persons in both groups at the time before and during the technique. The pain rating scale Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, Consolability; the Groningen stress scale and the STAI questionnaire were used. A total of 113 participants aged 3 to 4 years participated in the trial (n=113). 50% (55) were girls, mean total age 3.83&#xb1;0.59 years and accompanying persons 37.17&#xb1;6.96. During the technique the mean pain in control and intervention groups was 5.64&#xb1;3.30 and 3.87&#xb1;3.01; stress, 3.25&#xb1;1.22 and 2.67&#xb1;1.24, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found in the assessment of anxiety between the groups. Patients who underwent the Koala Attachment Distraction method venipuncture show a lower level of pain and anxiety than those who received physical restraint, and the anxiety perceived by the companion is similar in both groups.
