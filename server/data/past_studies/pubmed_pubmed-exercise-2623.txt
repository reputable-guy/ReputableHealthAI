Study Title: Effect of touch screen tablet use on fine motor functions in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Cerebral palsy is the most frequent condition affecting the central nervous system and causing large disability. To determine the impact of touch screen tablet upon fine motor functions in children with hemiparesis. This was a randomized controlled trial involving 60 children, ranging in age from 5 to 7 years old, randomized into two groups: intervention or control group (30 children per group). Both groups were given 12 consecutive weeks of designed fine motor tasks. Additionally, for thirty minutes, the intervention group was given a fine motor exercise program on a touch screen tablet. Upper limb function, finger dexterity and pinch strength were measured pre and post the recommended treatment program using the quality of upper extremity skill test (QUEST), Nine-Hole Peg Test and Jamar hydraulic pinch gauge, respectively. All outcome measures were equivalent between intervention groups at admission (P&#x200a;>&#x200a;0.05). Significant improvements were found in all assessed variables within the two groups. Meanwhile, the intervention group had significantly higher improvements (P&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05) in finger dexterity, pinch strength, and upper limb function when compared with the control groups. Including a touch screen smart tablet application with a specially designed fine motor program is an effective method that helps children with U-CP perform more effectively with their fine motor skills.
