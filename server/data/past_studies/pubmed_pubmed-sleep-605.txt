Study Title: Efficacy of Daoyin combined with lower limb robot as a comprehensive rehabilitation intervention for stroke patients: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive rehabilitation approach combining Traditional Chinese Medicine Daoyin with lower limb robotics during the recovery phase of stroke patients. Stroke patients meeting the specified criteria were randomly assigned to one of four groups using a random number table: Control group, Daoyin group, lower limb robot group (LLR group), and Daoyin and lower limb robot group (DLLR group). Each group received distinct treatments based on conventional rehabilitation training. The treatment duration spanned two weeks with two days of rest per week. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included various scales: Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Berg balance scale (BBS), Barthel index (BI), Fatigue Scale-14 (FS-14), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Statistically significant differences were observed in the lower limb function measured by FAM between the Control group (15 &#xb1; 5) and the DLLR group (18 &#xb1; 5) (0.049). In the Barthel index, a statistically significant difference was noted between the Control group (54 &#xb1; 18) and the DLLR group (64 &#xb1; 11) (0.041). Additionally, significant differences were found in the Berg balance scale between the Control group (21 &#xb1; 10) and the DLLR group (27 &#xb1; 8) (0.024), as well as between the Control group (21 &#xb1; 10) and the LLR group (26 &#xb1; 10) (0.048). The findings of this study suggest that the combined use of Daoyin and robotics not only enhances motor function in stroke patients but also has a positive impact on fatigue, sleep quality, and mood. This approach may offer a more effective rehabilitation strategy for stroke patients.
