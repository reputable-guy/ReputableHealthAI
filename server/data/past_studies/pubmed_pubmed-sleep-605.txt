Study Title: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial on purified and specific Cytoplasmic pollen extract for hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.

Study Summary:
evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of PureCyTonin against hot flashes (HF) in breast cancer survivors (BCS). a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Italy. administration of PureCyTonin or placebo, for 3&#x2009;months. Effectiveness was investigated through the compilation of a daily diary for HF and of validated questionnaires (Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Visual Analogical Scales (VAS) for HF, sweating, irritability, fatigue, sleep, quality of life), carried out before starting the treatment (T0), after 1&#x2009;month (T1) and after 3&#x2009;months (T2). Any side effects and HF diary were recorded at each visit. 19 women were randomized to receive PureCyTonin and 20 to placebo. At T2 compared to T0, in the PureCyTonin group, we found a reduction in the number of HF (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) measured by daily diary. An improvement in the subjective perception of women regarding HF intensity (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), sweat nuisance (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), irritability (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) and fatigue (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) was observed through VAS scale measurement at T2 compared to T0.The total MRS score was significantly better in the PureCyTonin group at T1 (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) compared to T0. PureCyTonin significantly reduces HF number after 3&#x2009;months of therapy in BCS and it is well-tolerated.
