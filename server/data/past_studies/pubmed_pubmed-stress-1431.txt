Study Title: The effects of aromatherapy and music on pain, anxiety, and stress levels in palliative care patients.

Study Summary:
Pain and anxiety levels in palliative care patients negatively impact their quality of life, highlighting the need for research on non-pharmacological methods. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of music and aromatherapy interventions on pain, anxiety, and stress levels in these patients. The research was designed as a single-blind, four-group, randomized controlled trial. The sample consisted of 88 patients hospitalized in a palliative care center (receiving palliative care services with terminal or advanced diseases). Patients were randomly assigned to four groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22, music, aromatherapy, music and aromatherapy, and control group). Patients in the experimental groups received the intervention to which they were assigned for 20&#xa0;min each day for three consecutive days: music, aromatherapy, or music accompanied by aromatherapy. No intervention was applied to the control group. The patients' levels of pain, anxiety, and stress were assessed before and after the intervention using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Facial Anxiety Scale (FAS), and the Distress Thermometer. No significant differences were found in the demographic characteristics of the groups (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated statistically significant differences in pre- and post-intervention scores for VAS, FAS, and Distress across all experimental groups on all follow-up days (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Implementing music, aromatherapy, and their combination effectively reduced pain, anxiety, and stress levels in palliative care patients, suggesting these non-pharmacological interventions can improve their quality of life.
