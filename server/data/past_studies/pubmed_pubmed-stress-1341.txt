Study Title: Efficacy of Dichrostachys Glomerata Supplementation on Overweight and Mildly Obese Adult's Weight, Mood, and Health-Related Quality of Life: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Despite their widespread use, research is needed to evaluate the weight loss and related health/wellness outcomes of herbal plants. Preliminary research found that the fruit ofis safe and has potential weight loss effects. This study aimed to examine the effect of a standardized powder offruit pods (DYG-400) on weight, food cravings, mood, and health-related quality of life of overweight and mildly obese adults. In this CONSORT-compliant double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 56 adults (Mean [] age = 44.50,[body mass index] BMI = 31.66) were randomized to either theGroup (DG; 300&#x2009;mg/d) or Placebo Group (PG; rice protein, 300&#x2009;mg/d) for 60&#x2009;days. Participants weight was assessed along with self-report assessments of the Food Cravings Questionnaire, CDC Health-related Quality of Life, Perceived Stress Scale, Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Profile of Mood States at Baseline, Day 30, and Day 60. The data were collected from March 2023 to June 2023 and stored electronically, and analyzed using general linear models with repeated measures. DG lost more weight at Day 60 compared to PG,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.05 (4.112.19 lbs). DG had reduced food cravings from Baseline to Day 30 and Day 60 compared to PG,&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001. Perceived stress,&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001, and mood,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.017, improved from Baseline to Day 60 for DG compared to PG. Anxiety decreased from Baseline to Day 60 for DG and from Baseline to Day 30 for PG,&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001. Health-related Quality of Life improved for DG compared to PG,&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001.(DYG-400) may be an effective herbal intervention to promote weight loss and health. Extended clinical trials across diverse populations and settings are needed.: ISRCTN10099861, https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10099861.
