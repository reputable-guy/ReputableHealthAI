Study Title: Effects and mechanisms of an online short-term audio-based mindfulness program on positive affect: A randomized controlled trial including exploratory moderator analyses.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of an online short-term audio-based mindfulness (SAM) intervention program on positive affect and explored how well-being and negative affect influenced these effects and mechanisms. Participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;100) were randomized into an intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) and a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50). Those in the mindfulness group underwent 3&#xa0;weeks of an online SAM program and completed the online measures four times, while those in the control group completed the measures twice. Participants completed measures including the World Health Organization Well-Being Index, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The effects of measures in both groups were compared. Parallel process latent growth curve modeling analysis was used to explore the longitudinal moderated mediation effects. The results showed that SAM was effective at improving positive affect, mindfulness, well-being, and reducing negative affect. Mindfulness growth speed during the intervention period mediated the relationship between SAM and positive affect improvement speed. The moderation effects of baseline well-being and negative effect on mediation effects were found to be significant. The SAM program was effective for the general public and was more beneficial for those with medium/high well-being and low/medium negative affect.
