Study Title: Coping styles in refugees with PTSD: Results from a randomized trial comparing EMDR therapy and stabilization.

Study Summary:
While treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugees is generally effective, many refugees remain symptomatic after treatment. Coping styles could be relevant to PTSD treatment response and as such may be a potential focus of PTSD treatment. The study aims to examine 1) if baseline coping styles are related to treatment response after EMDR therapy or stabilization, and 2) if coping styles change during these treatments. Seventy-two refugees with PTSD were randomly allocated to 12 hours of EMDR therapy or stabilization. A coping questionnaire (COPE-easy) and clinical interview for PTSD (CAPS-IV) were administered before and after treatment and at three-month follow-up. The association between baseline coping styles and PTSD symptom change was examined using regression analysis and a t-test. Changes in coping styles were analyzed using mixed design ANOVA. No significant relations between baseline coping style levels and PTSD symptom changes were found. Additionally, coping style levels did not change significantly after either treatment. Contrary to the hypothesis, we did not find any evidence that treatment was related to (changes in) coping style. Addressing pre-treatment coping styles among refugees receiving short-term therapy, may not be required for reducing PTSD. Changing coping styles may need a longer or different type of treatment.
