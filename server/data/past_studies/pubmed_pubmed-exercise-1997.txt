Study Title: [The effectiveness of Cytoflavin in the medical rehabilitation of elderly and senile patients].

Study Summary:
Study the effectiveness of Cytoflavin in the medical rehabilitation of elderly and senile patients after pneumonia associated with a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) at the outpatient stage. A prospective observational randomized study involving 66 patients (45 women and 21 men, average age 66.5&#xb1;5.1 years) undergoing outpatient medical rehabilitation after pneumonia associated with COVID-19, divided into 2 groups, comparable in age and gender. A standardized comprehensive rehabilitation program was conducted in both groups. Patients of the main group were additionally prescribed Cytoflavin according to the standard regimen. Testing was carried out on scales reflecting the physical condition, degree of asthenization, psycho-emotional and cognitive status (Borg scale, 6-minute walk test, SHAS-scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Mini-mental State Examination, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) upon admission to outpatient treatment and upon discharge. Against the background of Cytoflavin therapy, positive dynamics was observed in patients of the main group in the form of a decrease in the values of SHAS-scale (86.5 [7.3] vs 56.3 [7.2];=0.00001), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (68.6 [14.7] vs 43.6 [12.8];=0.025); improvements in TSH (383.3 m [48.2] vs 550 m [32.5];=0.0248) and the Borg scale 4.5 [1.32] vs 2.2 [0.52];=0.038); the severity of cognitive impairment on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased (26.05 [1.3] vs 28.47 [0.86];=0.0001); the emotional background improved - a decrease in the level of anxiety (10.7 [1.25] vs 5.6 [0.81];=0.0001) and depression (11.8 [1.48] vs 7.0 [1.24];=0.0001). The standard course of Cytoflavin therapy in the medical rehabilitation of elderly and senile patients after pneumonia associated with COVID-19 significantly reduces the severity of cognitive impairment, fatigue and depressive disorders, improves indicators of the emotional and volitional sphere, increases exercise tolerance.
