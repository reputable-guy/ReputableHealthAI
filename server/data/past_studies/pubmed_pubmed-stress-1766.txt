Study Title: Nicotinamide riboside for peripheral artery disease: the NICE randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
People with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) have increased oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial activity, and poor walking performance. NAD+ reduces oxidative stress&#xa0;and is an essential cofactor for mitochondrial respiration. Oral nicotinamide riboside (NR) increases bioavailability of NAD+ in humans. Among 90 people with PAD, this randomized double-blind clinical trial assessed whether 6-months of NR, with and without resveratrol, improves 6-min walk distance, compared to placebo, at 6-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, compared to placebo, NR significantly improved 6-min walk (+7.0 vs. -10.6 meters, between group difference: +17.6 (90% CI:&#x2009;+&#x2009;1.8,+&#x221e;). Among participants who took at least 75% of study pills, compared to placebo, NR improved 6-min walk by 31.0 meters and NR + resveratrol improved 6-min walk by 26.9 meters. In this work, NR meaningfully improved 6-min walk, and resveratrol did not add benefit to NR alone in PAD. A larger clinical trial to confirm these findings is needed.
