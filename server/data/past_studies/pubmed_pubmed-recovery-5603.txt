Study Title: Effect of a peer-led emergency department behavioral intervention on non-fatal opioid overdose: 18-month outcome in the Navigator randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Emergency departments (EDs) provide an opportunity to identify people at risk of overdose and reduce the risk. We evaluated the effect of an ED behavioral intervention delivered by peer recovery support specialists (PRSSs) on non-fatal opioid overdose. Two-arm, randomized trial. Two EDs in Rhode Island, USA. ED patients presenting with an opioid overdose, complications of opioid use disorder or a recent history of opioid overdose (November 2018-May 2021). Among 648 participants, the mean age was 36.9&#xa0;years, 68.2% were male and 68.5% were White. Participants were randomized to receive a behavioral intervention from a PRSS (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;323) or a licensed clinical social worker (LICSW) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;325). PRSS and LICSW used evidence-based interviewing and intervention techniques, informed by their lived experience (PRSS) or clinical theory and practice (LICSW). We identified non-fatal opioid overdoses in the 18&#x2009;months following the ED visit through linkage to statewide emergency medical services data using a validated case definition. The primary outcome was any non-fatal opioid overdose during the 18-month follow-up period. Among 323 participants randomized to the PRSS arm, 81 (25.1%) had a non-fatal opioid overdose during follow-up, compared with 95 (29.2%) of 325 participants randomized to the LICSW arm (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.24). There was no statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of randomization to the PRSS arm versus the LICSW arm on the risk of non-fatal opioid overdose, adjusting for the history of previous overdose (relative risk&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.86, 95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.67-1.11). In Rhode Island, USA, over one-in-four emergency department patients at high risk of overdose experience a non-fatal opioid overdose in the 18&#x2009;months post-discharge. We found no evidence that the risk of non-fatal opioid overdose differs for emergency department patients receiving a behavioral intervention from a peer recovery support specialist versus a licensed clinical social worker.
