Study Title: [Effect of auricular point pressure on anaesthetic recovery in the patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized controlled trial].

Study Summary:
To explore the effect of auricular point pressure on anesthetic recovery in the patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One hundred and forty patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized into a trial group (52 cases, 2 cases dropped out) and a control group (52 cases, 2 cases were eliminated). In the control group, the conventional anesthesia program and recovery intervention were adopted. In the trial group, on the basis of the regimen as the control group, the intervention of auricular point pressure was supplemented. The auricular points on the right side were selected, including sympathetic (AH), brain (subcortex, AT), thalamus, exciting point, heart and sore center. One day before operation, the auricular point pressure started; and the auricular points were stimulated specially before anesthesia (T0), at the moment of operation ending (T1), when entering the recovery room, at the moment of the tube removal (T2) and in 10 min of the tube removal (T3), respectively; each auricular point was pressed for 1 min a time. The recovery time of spontaneous breathing, the time of eye opening, the removal time of endotracheal tube, the recovery time of orientation, and the time of exiting recovery room were compared between the two groups. The score of pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and that of Richmond agitation-sedation scale (RASS) at T2, T3 and when exiting recovery room (T4), and the relevant circulatory indexes (heart rate [HR], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP] and mean arterial pressure [MAP]) at T0, T1, T2 and T3 were observed in the two groups. In the trial group, the recovery time of spontaneous breathing, the time of eye opening, the removal time of endotracheal tube, the recovery time of orientation, the time of exiting recovery room were shorter than those of the control group (<0.01,<0.05). The pain VAS and RASS scores at T2, T3 and T4, as well as HR, SBP, DBP and MAP at T0, T1, T2 and T3 were not different statistically between the two groups (>0.05). Auricular point pressure can shorten the recovery time from anesthesia in the patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
