Study Title: Randomized clinical trial of integral cognitive remediation program for major depression (INCREM).

Study Summary:
Despite achieving clinical remission, patients with depression encounter difficulties to return to their premorbid psychosocial functioning. Cognitive dysfunction has been proposed to be a primary mediator of functional impairment. Therefore, the new non-pharmacological procognitive strategy INtegral Cognitive REMediation for Depression (INCREM) has been developed with the aim of targeting cognitive and psychosocial functioning. This is a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial with three treatment arms. Fifty-two depressed patients in clinical remission, with psychosocial difficulties and cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to receive INCREM intervention, Psychoeducation programme, or treatment as usual. Patients were assessed before and after the study period, and six months after. The primary outcome was the change from baseline of patients' psychosocial functioning. Changes in cognitive functioning and other variables were considered secondary outcomes. The analysis showed a significant improvement in psychosocial functioning in the INCREM group, especially six months after the intervention, compared to patients who received the psychoeducation programme. An improvement in cognitive performance was also observed in the INCREM group. This study includes a small sample size due to the anticipated end of the clinical trial because of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility and potential efficacy of the INCREM program to improve not only cognitive performance but also psychosocial functioning in clinically remitted depressed patients, and such improvement is maintained six months after. It can be speculated that the maintenance is mediated by the cognitive enhancement achieved with INCREM.
