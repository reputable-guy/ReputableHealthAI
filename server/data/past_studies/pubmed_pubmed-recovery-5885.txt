Study Title: Efficacy of local infiltration analgesia on recovery after total hip arthroplasty using direct anterior approach under spinal anaesthesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The utilization of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is a common practice in total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures to mitigate postoperative pain and diminish the necessity for opioids. However, contemporary literature reports conflicting results. Our working hypothesis was that LIA renders better postoperative VAS-scores and reduces the need for oral analgetics. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at examining the effectiveness of LIA in THA. A total of 90 patients were included for statistical analysis. Our primary endpoint was the Visual Analogue Scale, VAS, (0: no pain, 10: unbearable pain) preoperatively, at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 12th hour postoperative intervals and at discharge. Our secondary endpoints included the postoperative opioid consumption, as well as patient satisfaction at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively, measured using the Numeric Rating Scale, NRS. LIA has a tendency for superior results regarding VAS- Scores at 3 and 4 hours postoperatively. There were no notable statistical distinctions observed in terms of patients necessitating rescue opioid consumption. Patient satisfaction using the NRS at both the 2-week and 6-week postoperatively did not differ significantly between both groups. The administration of LIA could offer advantages during the initial stages of postoperative recovery, which could be particularly valuable in rapid recovery programs.
