Study Title: Effect of Reliable Recovery on Health Care Costs and Productivity Losses in Emotional Disorders.

Study Summary:
Despite the high economic costs associated with emotional disorders, relatively few studies have examined the variation in costs according to whether the patient has achieved a reliable recovery. The aim of this study was to explore differences in health care costs and productivity losses between primary care patients from a previous randomized controlled trial (RCT)-PsicAP-with emotional symptoms who achieved a reliable recovery and those who did not after transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy (TD-CBT) plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Sociodemographic and cost data were obtained for 134 participants treated at five primary care centers in Madrid for the 12-month posttreatment period. Reliable recovery rates were higher in the patients who received TD-CBT&#x202f;+&#x202f;TAU versus TAU alone (66% vs. 34%, respectively; chi-square&#x202f;=&#x202f;13.78, df&#x202f;=&#x202f;1, p&#x202f;<&#x202f;.001). Patients who did not achieve reliable recovery incurred more costs, especially associated with general practitioner consultations (t&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.01, df&#x202f;=&#x202f;132, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;.003), use of emergency departments (t&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.20, df&#x202f;=&#x202f;132, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;.030), total health care costs (t&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.01, df&#x202f;=&#x202f;132, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;.040), and sick leaves (t&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.97, df&#x202f;=&#x202f;132, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;.048). These findings underscore the societal importance of achieving a reliable recovery in patients with emotional disorders, and further support the value of adding TD-CBT to TAU in the primary care setting.
