Study Title: Silver Lining Study: Missileer Fatigue Mitigation During 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.

Study Summary:
The U.S. Air Force's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force stands ready to launch weapons 365&#x2009;days per year. Since its inception, missileers vigilantly operate launch consoles on a 3-day cycle: minimum 24-hour alert-shift/24-hour travel-admin/24-hour off, leading to concerns that health, morale, and alertness are chronically impacted. In 2020, a Missileer Occupational Health Assessment (OHA) revealed 76% of respondents struggle with being rested for duty and 29% of respondents never feel adequately rested for duty. Later that year, 20th Air Force initiated long-duration operations to safeguard from the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic, resulting in increased operations tempo, and exacerbating crew fatigue.341st Operations Group and 341st Medical Group at Malmstrom Air Force Base enacted interventions to mitigate crew fatigue and support continued readiness during pandemic operations. They recorded, analyzed, and compiled findings in this report, including recommendations for long-term ICBM operations at Missile Wings. All participants were Nuclear and Missile Operations Officers, or missileers, were continuously evaluated with qualitative and quantitative measures to ensure safety of the force during a period of unprecedented change. Interventions implemented and evaluated during the 9-month period included: environmental modifications, scheduling changes, and crew education on fatigue management, nutrition, anticipatory sleep preparation, and fitness. Most notably, the 341st Operations Group examined various 3-person and 4-person shift-length and alert duration schedules. Psychomotor vigilance testing results validated safety of operators and delta between pre- and post-shift measurements. Crew force readiness trends were analyzed for force-health awareness. Pre- and post-OHA results were compared for subjective changes. Fatigue and health-related outcomes were collected from a safety monitoring effort during standard and COVID-19 operations at 341st Missile Wing. Findings from qualitative and quantitative data indicate the optimal schedule is a 3-week cycle:7-day alert/7-day recovery/7-day training-administrative utilizing 4-member or 3-member crews for low tempo operations. Crews experimented with shift-lengths of 24hrs-on/24hrs-off, 16hrs-on/8hrs-off, and 12hrs-on/12hrs-off. Maximum safe alert duration is 7&#x2009;days due to task fatigue onset between 8 and 10&#x2009;days. Short and long duration Duties Not to Include Flight (DNIF) (also known as Duties Not to Include Alert (DNIA) among missileers) rates decreased from the first to last month of the period by 74.6% and 79.2%, respectively. The number of alerts missed per month decreased 86% from baseline. The 2021 OHA found a 7% decline in members seeking separation, and absence of sleep, fatigue, and physical or mental health as missileer concerns. This analysis has identified a sustainable alert rotation of 7/7/7 with emphasis on protected recovery and training time and has been continued after concluding pandemic operations, creating consistent schedule stability where there once was none. If executed properly, this alert rotation, regardless of shift-length selected, has potential to improve trust between crews and leadership, provides adequate recovery time between alerts to maintain health, and improves wellness, family stability, morale, unit cohesion, and crew force retention. Notably, all Air Force Global Strike Missile Operations Groups adjusted scheduling practices to align with these findings.
