Intervention group had significantly lower anxiety scores than control group at fourth and eighth weeks (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the emotion change over time in control group (P > 0.05). The anxiety in the intervention group was significantly improved at the 4th and 8th weeks (P<0.05). Moreover, the stress and depression in the intervention group were significantly improved at the 8th week (P<0.05). Online mindfulness intervention can effectively improve emotional status.
