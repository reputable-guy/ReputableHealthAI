Study Title: Group cohesion and alliance predict cognitive-behavioral group treatment outcomes for youth with anxiety disorders.

Study Summary:
Knowledge about how to enhance group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) outcomes is needed. In a randomized controlled effectiveness trial, we examined group cohesion (the bond between group members) and the alliance (the client-clinician bond) as predictors of GCBT outcomes. The sample was 88 youth (age 11.7&#x2009;years,&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.1; 54.5% girls; 90.7% White) with anxiety disorders. Observers rated group cohesion and alliance in 32 sessions from 16 groups. We examined early group cohesion and alliance (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.50,&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) and group cohesion and alliance change from early to late in treatment in relation to outcomes using generalized estimation equations accounting for nesting within groups (ICCs .31 to .55). The outcomes were diagnostic recovery, clinical severity, and parent- and youth-reported anxiety symptoms, each at post-treatment, 12-months, and 4-years follow-up. There were more significant associations with 4-years follow-up than earlier outcomes. Clinical severity and parent-reported anxiety symptoms were more frequently predicted than diagnostic recovery. Clinician- and parent-reported outcomes were far more frequently significantly predicted by cohesion and alliance than youth-rated outcomes. We conclude that group cohesion and alliance are related but distinct variables, both associated with some GCBT outcomes for as long as 4 years after treatment.
