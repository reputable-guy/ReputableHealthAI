Study Title: Effects of exercise and dietary interventions on asprosin, leptin, and lipid metabolism in males with abdominal obesity, a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Addressing abdominal obesity requires multifaceted strategies, with physical activity and diet playing a pivotal role. The objective of this study was to assess alterations in body composition, adipokine concentrations, insulin resistance parameters, and lipid metabolism in males with abdominal obesity following two distinct interventions: exercise alone and exercise combined with a specific diet. The study involved 44 males with abdominal obesity (average age 34.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.5 years, waist circumference [WC] 110.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.5), randomly assigned to three groups: an experimental group with aerobic-resistance exercise (EG, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), an experimental group with aerobic-resistance exercise combined with a high-protein, low-glycemic index carbohydrate diet (EDG, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), both interventions lasting 6 weeks, and a control group without interventions (CG, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12). Body composition (body mass [BM], body fat percentage [BF%], fat-free mass [FFM], android body fat percentage [ANDR]), as well as biochemical blood analyses (asprosin [ASP], leptin [LEP], quantitative insulin sensitivity check index [QUICKI], and total cholesterol [TC]), were conducted at baseline and after 6 weeks of intervention. The impact of interventions on the analyzed variables among groups was assessed using mixed ANOVA tests with post-hoc comparisons. Effect size (ES) was also evaluated using &#x1d702;p. Significant reductions in ASP concentration after intervention were observed in both EG (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) and EDG (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). However, post-hoc tests revealed a decrease in LEP only in the EDG group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). In EDG substantial decreases after 6 weeks of intervention were noted in BM (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), BF% (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), ANDR (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) and TC (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). The most notable increase in FFM was observed in the EDG group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). More favourable metabolic outcomes were confirmed in the group combining diet with exercise, where there was a notable reduction in ASP levels by 16% and LEP by 48% after 6 weeks of intervention, compared to the group undergoing exercise alone.
