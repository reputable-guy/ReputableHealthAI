Study Title: Effect of nutrition counseling on nutritional status and gestational weight gain of pregnant adolescents in West Arsi, Central Ethiopia: a cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
When pregnancy occurs in adolescence, the growth and development of the mother and fetus may be impaired due to strong competition for nutrients between the still-growing adolescent and the fetus. Pregnant adolescents constitute an underserved population; they lack adequate nutritional knowledge. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of nutritional behavior change communication (NBCC) through alliance for development (AFD) on the nutritional status and gestational weight gain (GWG) of pregnant adolescents. A two-arm parallel cluster randomized controlled community trial was conducted in the West Arsi Zone, central Ethiopia, from August 2022 to July 2023. The nutritional status of the pregnant adolescent was assessed using mid-upper arm circumference. Weight was measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. A total of 207 and 219 pregnant adolescents participated in the intervention and control clusters, respectively. The intervention started before 16&#xa0;weeks of gestation, and the intervention group attended four NBCC sessions. The NBCC was based on the health belief model (HBM) and was given at the participants' homes with their husbands. The NBCC intervention was delivered by AFDs and community-level health actors. Pregnant adolescents in the control group received routine nutrition education from the health care system. A linear mixed-effects model and difference in difference (DID) were used to measure the intervention effect after adjusting for potential confounders. After the implementation of the trial, the mean mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) in the intervention arm significantly increased from baseline (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001), 23.19&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.1 to 25.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.9 among intervention group and 23.49&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.1 to 23.56&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.0 among control group and the mean difference in the MUAC (DID) was 1.89&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2&#xa0;cm (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001); the mean GWG in the intervention arm significantly increased from baseline; 51.54&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.7 to 60.98&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.6 among intervention group and 52.86&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.27 to 58&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.3 among control group; the mean GWG in the intervention group was 9.4&#xa0;kg, and that in the control group was 5.14&#xa0;kg, and the difference in difference was 4.23&#xa0;kg and this was statically significant p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001). This study demonstrated that the use of the HBM for NBCC delivered through the AFD was effective at improving the nutritional status and GWG of pregnant adolescents. These results imply the need for the design of model-based nutritional counseling guidelines.Clinical trial registration: PACTR202203696996305, Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, date of first registration: 16/03/2022.
