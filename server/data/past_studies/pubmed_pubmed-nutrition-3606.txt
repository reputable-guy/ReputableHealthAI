Study Title: Preliminary evaluation of a scenario-based nutrition literacy online programme for college students: a pilot study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to develop and evaluate a scenario-based nutrition literacy (NL) online programme for Taiwanese college students. A randomised pilot trial design was used in this study. The study was conducted at a university in Taiwan. The intervention consisted of a five-unit web-based NL programme including videos of real-life scenario-based stories, situational analysis teaching and after-unit quizzes. Theme-related website information and smartphone apps (both iOS and Android systems) were offered for reference in every unit. The NL measure consisted of a self-rated scale, a scenario-based test and a healthy eating behaviour survey. Paired sample t-tests and ANCOVA were performed to test the effects on NL and healthy eating behaviour. Participants were ninety-eight students, with a retention rate of 98 %. The ratio of men to women was 0&#xb7;2:1. Most students were freshmen (48 %). Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed significant post-intervention improvements in the NL and healthy eating behaviours after controlling for pretest scores. This pilot study offers preliminary evidence of the potential positive effects of implementing a scenario-based NL online programme for college students. It offers a possibly novel strategy to enhance health-promoting behaviours in Taiwanese universities. Further research with larger sample sizes and more rigorous designs is warranted to confirm and build upon these initial findings.
