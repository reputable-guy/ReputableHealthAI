Study Title: The Effect of Creatine Nitrate and Caffeine Individually or Combined on Exercise Performance and Cognitive Function: A Randomized, Crossover, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study examined the effect of creatine nitrate and caffeine alone and combined on exercise performance and cognitive function in resistance-trained athletes. In a double-blind, randomized crossover trial, twelve resistance-trained male athletes were supplemented with 7 days of creatine nitrate (5 g/day), caffeine (400 mg/day), and a combination of creatine nitrate and caffeine. The study involved twelve resistance-trained male athletes who initially provided a blood sample for comprehensive safety analysis, including tests for key enzymes and a lipid profile, and then performed standardized resistance exercises-bench and leg press at 70% 1RM-and a Wingate anaerobic power test. Cognitive function and cardiovascular responses were also examined forty-five minutes after supplementation. Creatine nitrate and caffeine that were co-ingested significantly enhanced cognitive function, as indicated by improved scores in the Stroop Word-Color Interference test (= 0.04; effect size = 0.163). Co-ingestion was more effective than caffeine alone in enhancing cognitive performance. In contrast, no significant enhancements in exercise performance were observed. The co-ingestion of creatine nitrate and caffeine improved cognitive function, particularly in cognitive interference tasks, without altering short-term exercise performance. Furthermore, no adverse events were reported. Overall, the co-ingestion of creatine nitrate and caffeine appears to enhance cognition without any reported side effects for up to seven days.
