Study Title: Feasibility and Acceptability of Spanish-Language Parenting Interventions for Young Children With Developmental Delays.

Study Summary:
Hispanic/Latinx parents of children with developmental delays/disabilities (DD) face disparities in service access and research participation. In the present study, 60 Spanish-speaking caregivers of young children with DD participated in randomly assigned stress reduction interventions (psychoeducation/support groups or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction [MBSR]), followed by behavioral parent training (BPT). Caregiver attendance and satisfaction ratings were measured, and focus groups gathered additional information on caregivers' takeaways from the interventions. Caregivers demonstrated high satisfaction across interventions, with slightly greater preference for psychoeducation/support groups, and qualitative data indicated that the relevance of the information and style of delivery may be responsible. Researchers and clinicians may attain greater engagement with this population by focusing on intervention services that include psychoeducation and peer support elements.
