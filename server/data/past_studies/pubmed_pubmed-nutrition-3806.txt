Study Title: Effect of fetal lung maturation on the efficacy of acetaminophen for premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of maturing fetal lung on clinical efficacy of acetaminophen in the treatment of premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A total of 441 premature infants admitted to our hospital from May 2020 to May 2021 were recruited, including 152 premature infants receiving fetal lung maturation (13 cases of PDA closure with drug use and 2 cases failed) and 289 cases without maturing fetal lung (17 cases of PDA closure and 8 cases failed). Finally, a total of 30 cases were enrolled in this clinical trial. All infants were divided into groups A and B according to whether fetal lung maturation was adopted before delivery. In group A, 13 infants received fetal lung maturation, and 17 in group B did not undergo fetal lung maturation. Infants in both groups were orally given with acetaminophen. After 3-day treatment, the second course of treatment was given immediately if PDA was not closed. The PDA closure rate and patency rate of PDA at the end of 2 treatment courses were statistically compared between 2 groups. The feeding intolerance, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, the age at total enteral nutrition and the length of hospital stay were also compared between 2 groups. After the 1st and 2nd treatment courses, the PDA closure rate in group A was 84.61%, significantly higher than 52.94% in group B (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05), whereas there was no significant difference in the PDA patency rate between 2 groups (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). No significant differences were observed regarding the feeding intolerance, renal failure, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the length of hospital stay and the age at total enteral nutrition between 2 groups (all P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). In addition, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in group A was 7.69%, slightly lower than 5.88% in group B (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). Compared with premature infants untreated with fetal lung maturation interventions before delivery, premature infants who receive fetal lung maturation interventions combined with acetaminophen for PDA are likely to obtain a higher PDA closure rate and a lower incidence rate of the upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
