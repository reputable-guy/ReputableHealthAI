Study Title: The Use of Yoga and Mindfulness-based Interventions to Reduce Stress and Burnout in Healthcare Workers: An Umbrella Review.

Study Summary:
Mental health problems are common in healthcare workers as they are exposed to a variety of risk factors. Healthcare professionals face extraordinary stressors in the medical environment. They demonstrate high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and burnout, and sleep disorders, which inevitably lead to medication errors and lower standards of care. We conducted a wide-ranging review to analyze how the use of yoga and mindfulness-based interventions reduce stress, anxiety, and burnout in healthcare workers. The main scientific databases we consulted, such as PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL, contain all the systematic reviews present in the literature. No restrictions of year, publication, or language were applied. Based on PRISMA guidelines, 12 reviews were included in this paper. Quality assessment of the systematic reviews included in the research was done using the AMSTAR checklist. In accordance with the literature, the study shows that increasing the use of yoga and mindfulness-based interventions can provide support to healthcare workers in achieving stable psycho-physical well-being, which can enhance their value within their work environment. Employers in the healthcare industry should consider implementing workplace wellness programs that integrate these methods to promote the well-being of their staff. MBI and yoga are effective interventions that can help the psychological functioning of healthcare professionals; however, further high-quality research is needed before this finding can be confirmed.
