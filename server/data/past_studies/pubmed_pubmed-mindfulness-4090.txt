Study Title: Mindfulness-based group intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes: initial findings from a pilot and feasibility randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate feasibility/acceptability of a virtual, group mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) adapted for pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D). This two-way controlled trial randomized adolescents 1:1 to MBI (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) or health education (HE; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) groups lasting 6-7&#x2009;weeks. Eligibility included 12-17&#x2009;years, T1D&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 year, and elevated scores on PROMIS depression or anxiety measures. Recruitment, retention, and session attendance were tracked to measure feasibility. Acceptability was measured via youth-reported post-session surveys. Adolescents completed depression, anxiety, and diabetes-specific surveys at baseline, immediately post-program, and 3&#x2009;months post-program completion. HbA1c values approximating these timeframes were obtained from chart review. 55% of screened participants were eligible to participate, and 100% of eligible youth enrolled. There was 93% study retention and 96% session attendance rates. Survey data were 100% complete at baseline, and 93% complete at post-program and 3-month follow-ups; 83% and 78% of MBI participants rated sessions as at least somewhat enjoyable and helpful, respectively, and 91% and 82% of HE participants rated sessions as at least somewhat enjoyable and helpful, respectively. Mean scores showed declines in depression, anxiety, disordered eating, diabetes distress, and HbA1c in both groups across time, with trends toward potential greater reductions in depression and HbA1c in MBI. This pilot provides preliminary evidence that virtual MBI and HE groups adapted for adolescents with T1D are feasible to deliver and acceptable, with potential improvement in psychosocial, behavioral, and diabetes-specific outcomes. Whether MBI is more effective for targeting negative affect and glycemic control in the context of adolescent T1D requires testing in a full-scale efficacy trial.
