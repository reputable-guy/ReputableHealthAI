Study Title: Impact of Catheter Ablation on Cognitive Function in Atrial Fibrillation: A Randomized Control Trial.

Study Summary:
Early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) has been reported following atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, whether POCD is persistent long-term is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine if AF catheter ablation is associated with persistent cognitive dysfunction at 12-month follow-up. This is a prospective study of 100 patients with symptomatic AF who failed at least 1 antiarrhythmic drug randomized to either ongoing medical therapy or AF catheter ablation and followed up for 12&#xa0;months. Changes in cognitive performance were assessed using 6 cognitive tests administered at baseline and during follow-up (3, 6, and 12&#xa0;months). A total of 96 participants completed the study protocol. Mean age was 59 &#xb1; 12 years (32% women, 46% with persistent AF). The prevalence of new cognitive dysfunction in the ablation arm compared with the medical arm was as follows: at 3&#xa0;months: 14% vs 2%; P = 0.03; at 6&#xa0;months: 4% vs 2%; P = NS; and at 12&#xa0;months: 0% vs 2%; P = NS. Ablation time was an independent predictor of POCD (P = 0.03). A significant improvement in cognitive scores was seen in 14% of the ablation arm patients at 12&#xa0;months compared with no patients in the medical arm (P = 0.007). POCD was observed following AF ablation. However, this was transient with complete recovery at 12-month follow-up.
