Study Title: Development of a mindfulness-based intervention for narcolepsy: a feasibility study.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been shown to improve psychosocial functioning in medical populations but have not been studied in narcolepsy. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of an MBI that was adapted for narcolepsy, including three variations in program length. Adults with narcolepsy (N&#x2005;=&#x2005;60) were randomized to MBI groups of varying durations: brief (4 weeks), standard (8 weeks), or extended (12 weeks). Participants completed assessments at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. To assess feasibility and acceptability, primary outcomes included attendance, meditation practice, and data completeness. Additionally, participants completed measures of mindfulness, self-compassion, mood, sleep, psychosocial functioning, and cognition. An effect size of Cohen's d&#x2005;&#x2265;&#x2005;0.5 was used as the prespecified benchmark for a minimal clinically important difference (MCID). The attendance, meditation, and data completeness benchmarks were met by 71.7%, 61.7%, and 78.3% of participants, respectively. Higher proportions of the brief and extended groups met these benchmarks compared to the standard group. All groups met the MCID for mindfulness, self-compassion, self-efficacy for managing emotions, positive psychosocial impact, global mental health, and fatigue. Standard and extended groups met the MCID for anxiety and depression, and extended groups met the MCID for additional measures including social and cognitive functioning, daytime sleepiness, hypersomnia symptoms, and hypersomnia-related functioning. Results suggest that the remote delivery and data collection methods are feasible to employ in future clinical trials, and it appears that the extended MBI provides the most favorable clinical impact while maintaining attendance and engagement in meditation practice.
