Study Title: Neither an Individualised Nor a Standardised Sodium Bicarbonate Strategy Improved Performance in High-Intensity Repeated Swimming, or a Subsequent 200 m Swimming Time Trial in Highly Trained Female Swimmers.

Study Summary:
Inconsistent swimming performances are often observed following sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO) ingestion, possibly because the time taken to reach peak blood buffering capacity is highly variable between individuals. Personalising NaHCOingestion based on time-to-peak blood bicarbonate (HCO) could be a solution; however, this strategy is yet to be explored in swimming, or adequately compared to standardised NaHCOapproaches. Therefore, six highly trained female swimmers ingested 0.3 g&#xb7;kg BMNaHCOin capsules to pre-determine their individual time-to-peak blood HCO. They then participated in three experimental trials, consisting of a 6 &#xd7; 75 m repeated sprint swimming test, followed by a 200 m maximal time trial effort after 30 min active recovery. These experiments were conducted consuming a supplement at three different timings: individualised NaHCO(IND: 105-195 min pre-exercise); standardised NaHCO(STND: 150 min pre-exercise); and placebo (PLA: 90 min pre-exercise). Both NaHCOstrategies produced similar increases in blood HCOprior to exercise (IND: +6.8 vs. STND: +6.1 mmol&#xb7;L,< 0.05 vs. PLA) and fully recovered blood HCOduring active recovery (IND: +6.0 vs. STND: +6.3 mmol&#xb7;Lvs. PLA,< 0.05). However, there were no improvements in the mean 75 m swimming time (IND: 48.2 &#xb1; 4.8 vs. STND: 48.9 &#xb1; 5.8 vs. PLA: 49.1 &#xb1; 5.1 s,= 0.302) nor 200 m maximal swimming (IND: 133.6 &#xb1; 5.0 vs. STND: 133.6 &#xb1; 4.7 vs. PLA: 133.3 &#xb1; 4.4 s,= 0.746). Regardless of the ingestion strategy, NaHCOdoes not appear to improve exercise performance in highly trained female swimmers.
