Study Title: Brain compensatory mechanisms in depression and memory complaints in fibromyalgia: the role of theta oscillatory activity.

Study Summary:
The different clinical presentations of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) might play independent roles in the unclear etiology of cognitive impairments and depressive symptoms seen in patients with FMS. Understanding how these clinical presentations are associated with the clinical and neurophysiological aspects of FMS is important for the development of effective treatments. To explore the relationship of memory complaints and depressive symptoms with the different clinical and neurophysiological characteristics of FMS. Cross-sectional data analysis from a randomized clinical trial. Baseline demographics and data on physical fitness, sleep, anxiety, depression, cortical excitability, and pain (clinical and mechanistic) from 63 subjects with FMS were used. Multiple linear and logistic association models were constructed. Final regression models including different sets of predictions were statistically significant (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), explaining approximately 50% of the variability in cognitive complaints and depression status. Older subjects had higher levels of anxiety, poorer sleep quality, lower motor threshold, and higher relative theta power in the central area and were more likely to have clinical depression. Higher anxiety, pain, and theta power were associated with a higher likelihood of memory complaints. Depression symptoms seem to be associated with transcranial magnetic stimulation-indexed motor threshold and psychosocial variables, whereas memory complaints are associated with pain intensity and higher theta oscillations. These mechanisms might be catalyzed or triggered by some behavioral and clinical features, such as older age, sleep disruption, and anxiety. The correlation with clinical variables suggests that the increasing of theta oscillations is a compensatory response in patients with FMS, which can be explored in future studies to improve the treatment of FMS.
