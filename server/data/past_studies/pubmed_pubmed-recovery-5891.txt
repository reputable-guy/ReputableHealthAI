Study Title: Exoskeletal-Assisted Walking During Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation Enhances Recovery for Persons with Spinal Cord Injury-A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Spinal cord injury (SCI) negatively impacts individuals' functional independence, and motor and sensory function. Intense walking training has been shown to facilitate recovery for individuals with chronic SCI. Powered robotic exoskeletons provide therapists with a tool that allows them to conduct walking training with less therapist effort as compared to conventional walking training. Exoskeletal-assisted walking (EAW) has been studied in the chronic SCI population with preliminary reports showing benefits in mobility, health, and quality-of-life outcomes. However, few reports have studied EAW's benefits in the acute (<90 days post) SCI population at a time when neural plasticity is most dynamic and modifiable. The purpose of the study was to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand the effects of incorporated EAW in acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) for individuals with SCI on functional, motor, and sensory recovery. The study outcomes included the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III and International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) motor and sensory scores that were assessed by unblinded assessors. We also recorded EAW session data, including adverse events, walking and up time, step counts, Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), and compliance with scheduled EAW training. From August 2019 to July 2022, 16 participants completed the AIR with incorporated EAW, and 12 completed the standard AIR, all with SCI and preserved leg function within 90 days post-injury. During each session, the AIR with incorporated EAW group averaged 34.3 (&#xb1;9.4) min of up time, 25.4 (&#xb1;7.7) min of walk time, and 536 (&#xb1;157) steps. Analysis via two-by-two mixed-effects models showed significant increases in the SCIM total score and ISNCSCI total motor and sensory scores over time for the AIR with incorporated EAW group [SCIM total score:(1, 26) = 5.59,= 0.03; total motor score:(1, 26) = 8.06,< 0.01; total sensory score:(1, 19.2) = 5.08,= 0.04], outperforming the standard AIR group. The AIR with incorporated EAW group showed 13, 14, and 22 points higher changes in the SCIM total score, total motor score, and total sensory score (respectively) by discharge compared with the standard AIR group. Incorporating EAW into AIR may facilitate functional, motor, and sensory recovery for individuals with SCI during AIR better than standard AIR. However, the study had a limited sample size. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of EAW in AIR.
