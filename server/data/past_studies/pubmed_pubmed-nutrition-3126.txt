Study Title: Use of the Omaha System nursing model on nutritional status outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Study Summary:
To construct and apply a risk screening and intervention system for malnutrition in peritoneal dialysis patients based on the Omaha System. A total of 75 peritoneal dialysis patients were randomly divided into control (38 cases) and intervention group (37 cases). The control group received routine operation training and health education, and the intervention group implemented a nutritional management plan based on the Omaha System. The modified quantitative subjective comprehensive nutritional scale (MQSGA) score, kidney disease dietary compliance attitude (RAAQ) and behavior (RABQ) score, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), and hemoglobin (Hb) were observed. Before intervention, there was no significant difference in these indicators between the two groups (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). After 6&#xa0;months, the MQSGA score in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). RAAQ score and RABQ score in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group and (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), and the nutritional indicators in the intervention group, such as BMI, ALB, PA, and Hb, were higher than those in the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). A nutritional management plan based on the Omaha System can help improve the nutrition condition of peritoneal dialysis patients, and improve the dietary compliance of chronic kidney disease patients.
