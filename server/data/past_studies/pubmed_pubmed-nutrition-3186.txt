Study Title: A Prospective, Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a Vegan Nutraceutical to Improve Hair Growth and Quality in Females Following a Plant-Based Diet.

Study Summary:
Hair thinning affects upwards of 50% of women by age 50, impacting their social-emotional wellbeing. It is a condition now thought to be driven by a multi-factorial etiology, including diet and nutrition. Women following vegan, vegetarian, or other plant-based diets have specific needs for nutrients traditionally sourced from animals, which could affect hair health.&nbsp;To support hair growth and quality in women following a plant-based diet, a novel vegan nutraceutical (Nutrafol Women's Vegan Capsules, Nutraceutical Wellness, Inc., New York, NY) was evaluated for its ability to support hair health. The objectives of this 6-month, multi-site, single-blind prospective clinical study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the nutraceutical to improve hair growth and quality in women consuming a plant-based diet. The primary endpoint in this study was an increase in terminal hair count at day 180 compared with baseline, as assessed through phototrichogram analysis. Ninety-five subjects completed the study.&nbsp;Daily intake of the nutraceutical resulted in a significant increase in the number of terminal hairs at day 90 (P&lt;0.01) and day 180 (P&lt;0.01). There was also an increase in total hair counts (P&lt;0.01), the terminal-to-vellus ratio (P&lt;0.01), and a decrease in shedding (P&lt;0.01). Global Investigator Ratings revealed improved hair growth (P&lt;0.00001) and overall quality (P&lt;0.00001). In-person hair strength and brittleness assessments significantly improved as well (P&lt;0.01 for both). A significant proportion of subjects reported improved hair quality, appearance, texture, and volume. Hair problems affecting the quality of life of the subjects were also reported as improved. This study demonstrated significant improvements in hair growth and quality in a plant-based population with a vegan nutraceutical. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05332743.
