Study Title: Implementing changing behaviour towards aerobic and strength exercise: Results of a randomised, phase I study determining the safety, feasibility, and consumer-evaluation of an online exercise program in persons with multiple sclerosis.

Study Summary:
Many people with MS do not meet the recommended exercise regime to elicit health benefits. This study aimed to determine the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and appropriateness of an exercise intervention delivered online to persons with MS that meets current exercise recommendations and behaviour change principles. Seventy-two participants (age: 43.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;13.3&#xa0;years) with mild to moderate MS were stratified according to previous exercise behaviour and block-randomised into one of three groups: Control (CON; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24), General Exercise (GE; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24) who at screening did not meet current exercise recommendations, and Advanced Exercise, (AE; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24) who at screening met the current exercise recommendations. GE and AE groups received a four-month online-supervised, behaviour change theory-based exercise program and were assessed at baseline, four-months, five-months, and eleven-months for physical activity participation. The feasibility of process, resources, management, and scientific outcomes was assessed. Of 198 potential participants, 143 met the eligibility criteria (72&#xa0;%), and 72 were randomised. Fifty-three participants completed the intervention (74&#xa0;% immediate retention), and 44 were retained at the six-month follow-up (61&#xa0;%). Personnel time was 369&#xa0;h, and total per-participant cost was Au$1036.20. Adherence rate to &#x2265;70&#xa0;% of exercise sessions was 73&#xa0;% (GE) and 38&#xa0;% (AE). The GE group observed a small magnitude of improvement in physical activity (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.23). An online exercise program embedded with behaviour interventions for either GE or AE appears feasible, acceptable, appropriate and safe and may show long-term efficacy in increased exercise behaviours for persons with mild to moderate MS.
