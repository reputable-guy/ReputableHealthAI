Study Title: 'Touch for Health' based kinesiology interventions: An innovative qualitative research exploring clients' perspectives.

Study Summary:
Touch for health (TFH) based kinesiology is a complementary therapy with foundations in a natural health training developed utilising techniques from chiropractic, osteopathy and acupressure therapies. Although popular, the impact of the therapy is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to understand outcomes of TFH-based kinesiology interventions that clients perceive as important in their lives. A qualitative phenomenological approach was chosen to capture rich descriptive data. Thirteen individuals were recruited from TFH-based kinesiology practices. Focus groups included semi-structured questions, photo-elicitation and a wellness word activity to prompt discussion on impacts of interventions. Audio-recordings were transcribed, coded and grouped to develop themes. Comparisons were made and linked with the wellness model, theory of planned behaviour and mindfulness-based interventions. Three interrelated themes emerged: impact on awareness, experience of effects and impact on action. TFH-based kinesiology was perceived to enhance self-awareness and feelings of wellbeing, promote self-care and support new actions to manage stress and complement conventional healthcare. The use of a mind-body approach with feedback from muscle testing and less need for dialogue were valued. Photo-elicitation generated rich narratives recounting experiences after interventions. Impacts aligned with the wellness model and resembled outcomes of mindfulness-based interventions. This study provides an insight into experiences and impacts of TFH-based kinesiology. Interventions were seen to facilitate self-awareness, experiences of wellbeing and promote self-care. Findings contribute towards a knowledge-base to foster dialogue and inform TFH-based kinesiologists, health professionals, consumers and research of TFH-based kinesiology and comparative therapies.
