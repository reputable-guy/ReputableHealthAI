Study Title: Intake of Dark and Milk Chocolate Differently Affects Autonomic Nervous Control of the Heart During Rest and Mental Stress.

Study Summary:
Chocolate is a popular food that may affect the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a single dose of dark or milk chocolate on ANS cardiac control during rest and mental stress induced by the Stroop test (ST). Healthy participants, divided into DARK or MILK chocolate groups, ingested corresponding type of chocolate (1&#x2009;g/kg body weight). They underwent measurement of ANS during relaxation and ST before and 2&#x2009;h after chocolate consumption. ANS control was assessed by determination of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability using parameters related to complex autonomic modulation (TP, SDNN) or primary vagal modulation (HFnu, RMSSD). HR was always increased during ST in both groups. Relaxation HR values after chocolate ingestion were higher only in the DARK chocolate group. During ST, values of TP, SDNN and HFnu decreased before and after chocolate ingestion in the DARK group, but only before chocolate ingestion in the MILK group. RMSSD values decreased during ST before and after chocolate ingestion in both groups. Relaxation TP, RMSSD and HFnu values after chocolate ingestion were lower in the DARK but not in the MILK group. The results suggest that even a single dose of milk chocolate attenuates changes in ANS cardiac control induced by mental stress, whereas a single dose of dark chocolate has an activating effect on the heartmodification of ANS cardiac control at rest. Different levels of sugars and cocoa biologically active compounds in the two types of chocolate could explain the observed effects.
