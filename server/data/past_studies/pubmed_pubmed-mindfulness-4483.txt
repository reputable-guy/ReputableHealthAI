Study Title: Mindfulness Combined With Exercise Online (MOVE) Compared With a Self-management Guide for Adults With Chronic Pain: A Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Limited studies exist combining mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and exercise in a pain management programme (PMP), with none thus far delivering a combined intervention as an online PMP. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a combined MBSR and exercise online PMP for adults with chronic pain and to examine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing MBSR and exercise delivered online with an online self-management guide. A feasibility RCT was conducted with participants randomized into the MOVE group (8-wk MBSR and exercise live online) or the self-management (SM) group (8-wk online self-management guide). Primary outcomes included recruitment, attrition, intervention adherence, and satisfaction. Participants wore a Fitbit watch during the study and completed patient-reported outcome measures at baseline, postintervention, and 12-week follow-up. Ninety-six participants were randomized and 80 (83.3%) completed the interventions. Higher mean satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8) was reported in the MOVE group 26.2 (&#xb1;5.5) than the SM group 19.4 (&#xb1;5.6). The Patient Global Impression of Change scale showed favourable changes in both groups; 65.1% of the MOVE group, 42.3% of the SM group reporting improvement. Seventy-three participants (76.3%) adhered to wearing the Fitbit for 8 weeks. Comparable improvements postintervention and at a 12-week follow-up were noted within both groups for Brief Pain Inventory, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Pain Disability Index, Pain Catastrophising Scale, Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire and Short Form-36 Health Survey. The findings suggest both interventions explored are acceptable and feasible. A fully powered RCT examining the effectiveness of MBSR combined with exercise, delivered live online is warranted.
