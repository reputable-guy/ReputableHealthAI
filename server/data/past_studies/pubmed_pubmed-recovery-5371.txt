Study Title: Effect of different anesthesia depths on perioperative heart rate variability and hemodynamics in middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia.

Study Summary:
To analyze the effects of different anesthesia depths on perioperative heart rate variability and hemodynamics in middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia, and to provide a basis for clinical application. A total of 111 patients with gastric cancer who were treated with epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia were selected as the study subjects, and the patients were randomly divided into group A, group B and group C. The bispectral index (BIS) was maintained by adjusting the infusion speed of anesthetics, the BIS of group A was maintained at 50&#x2009;~&#x2009;59, the BIS of group B was maintained at 40&#x2009;~&#x2009;49, and the BIS of group C was maintained at 30&#x2009;~&#x2009;39. The high-frequency power (HFP), low-frequency power (LFP), total power (TP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured before anesthesia induction (T1), immediately after intubation (T2), 3&#xa0;min after intubation (T3), and 6&#xa0;min after extubation (T4). The cognitive function of the patients was evaluated before and 48&#xa0;h after surgery. The HFP, LFP/HFP, TP, HR, DBP and SBP between the three groups at T1&#x2009;~&#x2009;T3 are significantly difference from each other (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There were significant differences in spontaneous breathing recovery time, eye opening time and extubation time among group A, B and C groups, and group B had the lowest spontaneous breathing recovery time, eye opening time and extubation time (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions during anesthesia between the three groups. The cognitive function score of group B was significantly higher than that of group A and group C (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). BIS maintenance of 40&#x2009;~&#x2009;49 has little effect on perioperative heart rate variability and hemodynamics in middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia, which is helpful for postoperative recovery.
