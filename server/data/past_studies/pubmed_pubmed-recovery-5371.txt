Study Title: Protein Supplement Tolerability and Patient Satisfaction after Bariatric Surgery.

Study Summary:
Disproportional fat-free mass loss often occurs post-bariatric surgery, partly due to insufficient protein intake during the post-surgery recovery phase. We compared five protein-enhancing strategies (PES) on patient tolerability, satisfaction and protein intake. Ninety-four participants, scheduled for bariatric surgery, were enrolled and allocated to either of the following: (1) whey powder, (2) hydrolysed collagen powder, (3) plant-based powder, (4) protein-rich products, (5) protein gel, or control. PES groups were instructed to add 30 g of powder or 2 gels or protein products to their diet. Patient satisfaction and tolerability were evaluated with questionnaires. Dietary intake was assessed prior to and during PES use. Seven patients dropped out (i.e. loss of contact, personal reasons or post-surgery complications) yielding an analytical cohort of 87 participants. The majority of patients (61%) did not experience dietary complaints from PES and could use PES&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;5 days of the week. PES non-usage was mainly related to taste dislike (58%). Hydrolysed collagen scored highest on tolerability and satisfaction: 86% of the participants could use HC&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;5 days and 71% were satisfied with the product. PES increased protein intake from 54.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;21.5 g/day to 64.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;23.4 g/day during the intervention (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), which differed from the control group (+&#x2009;10.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;24.5 g/day vs.&#x2009;-&#x2009;6.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;23.8 g/day for controls, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019). Whey showed the highest increase, namely&#x2009;+&#x2009;18.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;16.3 g/day (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). PES were tolerated by the majority of participants, and an improved protein intake with PES use was seen. However, the taste of the products could be improved to further enhance satisfaction and tolerability.
