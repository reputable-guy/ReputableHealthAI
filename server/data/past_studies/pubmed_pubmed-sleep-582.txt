Study Title: Modafinil Subjectively Does Not Impair Sleep in Aviators After a Period of Extended Wakefulness.

Study Summary:
Modafinil is used as a countermeasure to limit the effects of fatigue in military aviation. However, literature is conflicting about its negative effects on subsequent sleep.This randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted by the Center of Man in Aviation of the Royal Netherlands Airforce is part of a larger study. It included 32 subjects (mean age 35&#x2009;yr old, 84% male) who followed a normal daily routine and stayed awake the subsequent night. At midnight, all subjects received either 300&#x2009;mg caffeine, 200&#x2009;mg modafinil, or placebo. At the end of the test night, subjects were awake for a median period of 26&#x2009;h. Afterwards, sleep questionnaires containing qualitative (Groningen Sleep Quality Scale) and quantitative parameters of sleep for the subsequent day (recovery sleep) and consecutive night (post-test sleep) were completed and statistically analyzed using Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests.A statistically significant difference in the reported recovery sleep was observed. The modafinil group slept 30% shorter than placebo, but sleep efficiency was not statistically different. Quantitatively post-test sleep did not vary statistically significantly between the three groups. However, Groningen Sleep Quality Scale scores were lower post-test than pre-test in the modafinil group, while this was not the case in the caffeine and placebo group.This study found that modafinil subjectively does not negatively impact recovery sleep or subsequent nighttime sleep after an extended period of wakefulness and suggests it may decrease the need for recovery sleep compared to placebo or caffeine.
