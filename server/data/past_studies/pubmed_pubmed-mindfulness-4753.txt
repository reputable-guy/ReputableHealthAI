Study Title: Mindfulness-based supportive therapy on reducing suffering in patients with advanced cancer: randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Suffering is common among patients with advanced cancer. The practice of mindfulness during patient care can potentially reduce suffering. We aimed to examine the efficacy of mindfulness-based supportive therapy (MBST) on reducing suffering in patients with advanced cancer. We conducted a parallel-group, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial at the University of Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia. Seventy-three patients with advanced cancer with an overall suffering score &#x2265;4/10 based on the Suffering Pictogram were recruited and randomly assigned into either the MBST group (n=34) or the control group (n=39). There was a statistically significant reduction in the overall suffering score in the MBST group compared with the control group (U=432.5, median=-2.0, median=-1.0, z=-2.645, p=0.008). There was also significant improvement in the total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (U=483.5, median=-4.0, median=-3.0, z=-1.994, p=0.046), and the total Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being score (U=252.0, median=+14.5, median=+5.0, z=-4.549, p=0.000) in the MBST group compared with the control group. The results provided evidence that the practice of MBST during patient care could promote positive psychosocial outcomes.
