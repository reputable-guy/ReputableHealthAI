Study Title: Effects of two different dual-task training protocols on gait, balance, and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults: a 24-week randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Although alternating dual-task (ADT) training is functionally easier for older adults, a large part of the motor and cognitive tasks is simultaneously performed, especially during activities of daily living that require maintaining body balance. To evaluate the effects of mixed dual-task training on mobility, cognitive function, and balance in community-dwelling older adults. Sixty participants were randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio into the experimental group-single motor task (SMT) and simultaneous dual task (SDT) interchangeably in stage 1 (for 12 weeks) and after strictly with SDT in stage 2 (the last 12 weeks)-or into the control group-only SMT and SDT interchangeably in stages 1 and 2. Gait parameters were acquired by two inertial sensors. Physical and cognitive performance were acquired by specific questionnaires. Generalized linear mixed models were used for analyzing interaction and main effects. No between-group difference was observed for gait performance. Both protocols improved mobility (mean change ((MC) = 0.74)), dual-task effect (MC = -13.50), lower limb function (MC = 4.44), static (MC = -0.61), and dynamic balance (MC = -0.23), body sway (MC = 4.80), and cognitive function (MC = 41.69). Both dual-task training protocols improved these outcomes.
