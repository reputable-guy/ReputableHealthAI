Study Title: Enhancing postoperative recovery in total hip arthroplasty: the role of pericapsular nerve group and lateral cutaneous nerve block under spinal anaesthesia.

Study Summary:
To compare the efficacy of spinal anaesthesia alone versus spinal anesthesia augmented with ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block combined with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) block in improving perioperative analgesia and functional recovery in patients undergoing THA. In a prospective, randomized clinical trial we included 66 patients scheduled for THA were divided into two groups: one receiving spinal anaesthesia alone (SA group; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;32) and the other receiving spinal anaesthesia with regional analgesia blocks PENG&#x2009;+&#x2009;LFCN (SRAB group; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34). In the SRAB group, PENG followed by LFCN blocks were administered under ultrasound guidance before spinal anaesthesia. There were significant differences between the two groups in the onset of postoperative pain (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) and the total amount of analgesics required in the first 36 postoperative hours (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). The combined approach of spinal anaesthesia with PENG and LFCN blockade, enables opioid-free analgesia and may contribute to a safer and more comfortable postoperative experience for THA patients.
