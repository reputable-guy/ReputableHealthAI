Study Title: The acute effects of coffee ingestion on postural control and physical function in older adults: A randomised crossover trial.

Study Summary:
Caffeine consumption can elicit improvements in aspects of physical function in older adults but also, negatively modify standing balance, potentially increasing fall risk. However, balance alterations and changes in physical function induced by commonly consumed caffeine vehicles such as coffee have not been investigated. Therefore, this study investigated coffee ingestion providing 3&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg BWcaffeine on balance performance and physical function, in a group of older adults. In a randomised, crossover design, 22 older adults (Male n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10, Age: 68&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6&#xa0;years) completed bipedal standing balance and physical function assessments (Senior Fitness Test) under one of the following conditions: caffeinated coffee (COF), decaffeinated coffee (DEC), placebo (PLA) or a control (CON) (no fluid ingestion). Centre of pressure (COP) root mean square and power frequency were calculated to characterise postural performance and strategy, respectively. The complexity (i.e., regularity) of the COP signal was also determined by calculating sample entropy. Caffeinated coffee had limited effects on COP outcomes. Frequency of the COP in the anteroposterior direction was greater following COF compared to DEC (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.047;g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.29) but there were no statistical differences between COF and PLA or CON (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant performance differences between any conditions in all tests of physical function (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). This suggests that coffee has limited effects on balance performance or physical function but may influence both balance complexity and the strategy utilised to maintain upright stance. Overall, a strong cup of coffee does not significantly influence balance and measures of functional performance in healthy older adults.
