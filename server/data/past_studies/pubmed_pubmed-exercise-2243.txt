Study Title: Design of the VOILA-intervention study: A 12-week nutrition and resistance exercise intervention in metabolic or mobility compromised Dutch older adults and the response on immune-metabolic, gut and muscle health parameters.

Study Summary:
Exercise and nutrition interventions can slow ageing-induced decline in physiology. However, effects are heterogeneous and usually studied separately per outcome domain. In the VOILA study, we simultaneously study various health outcomes relevant for older adults and the inter-individual heterogeneity in response to a lifestyle intervention. VOILA is a 12-week lifestyle intervention in 3 groups of older adults (&#x2265;60 years), with compromised mobility (n=50), compromised metabolic health (n=50), or recovering from total knee replacement (TKR, n=70, of which 20 randomized to standard care only). The intervention includes high-intensity resistance exercise training thrice weekly, nutritional counselling, and nutritional supplements every morning and evening (including 20-25&#x202f;g whey protein and (evening only) 5.5&#x202f;g Biotis&#x2122; GOS). We measure immune-metabolic, gut health, muscle mass and physical functioning at baseline and after completion of the intervention/standard care. An additional reference group of healthy older adults (n=50) will undergo baseline measurements only. Improvements in various physiological systems are expected, but with differences between groups/individuals. This study will provide insights into how the physiological state of older adults influences the extent of lifestyle-induced health improvements to create better tailored interventions to attenuate biological ageing and improve the health span of subgroups and individuals.
