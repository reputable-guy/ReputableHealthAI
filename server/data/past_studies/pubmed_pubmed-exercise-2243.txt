Study Title: mHealth-Based Self-Management Program for Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that gradually limits physical function and decreases quality of life (QOL). We evaluated an mHealth-based self-management program to help patients with RA improve their physical and psychological health, self-efficacy, physical activity, and QOL. The sample included 73 experimental and 69 control participants. A pilot randomized controlled design was employed to identify the effectiveness of an 8-week mHealth-based self-management program, which comprised educational modules regarding disease management and exercise, cognitive training, and motivational support through mobile messages and periodic phone calls. Knowledge of the health effects of RA, disease activity, perceived health, depression, self-efficacy for controlling symptoms, physical activity, and QOL were evaluated pre- and postintervention and after the 4-week follow-up period. This pilot study indicates that the mHealth-based program for people with RA is feasible. The mHealth self-management program improved patients' knowledge of RA, depression, self-efficacy for controlling symptoms, physical activity, and perceived health; however, disease activity and QOL did not significantly change. This pilot study demonstrates the potential of mHealth intervention as an effective program for strengthening self-management capacities in patients with RA. Trial Registration: KCT0007523.
