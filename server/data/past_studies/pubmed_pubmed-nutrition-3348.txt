Study Title: Effectiveness of the online-based comprehensive cognitive training application, Smart Brain, for community-dwelling older adults with dementia: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The fourth industrial revolution has brought about developments in information and communication technologies for interventions in older adults with dementia. Currently, most interventions focus on single interventions. However, community-dwelling older adults with dementia require comprehensive cognitive interventions, and clinical studies analyzing the effects of comprehensive interventions based on randomized controlled trials are lacking. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an information and communication technology-based comprehensive cognitive training program, Smart Brain, on multi-domain function among community-dwelling older adults with dementia. This was a two-group, randomized, controlled trial. This study was conducted at participant's home. We analyzed older adults with dementia. Participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (N.=30) or the control group (N.=30). Older adults with dementia in the intervention group received 8 weeks of Smart Brain comprehensive cognitive training using a tablet, whereas the control group received a similar tablet but without the training. We measured the outcomes at baseline, and at 4 and 8 weeks. Cognitive function, depression, quality of life, balance confidence, physical ability, nutrition, and caregiver burden were compared between groups. In the intervention group, cognitive function statistically increased from baseline to both week 4 (2.03; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.81) and week 8 (2.70; 95% CI 1.76 to 3.64). Depression was statistically different from week 0 to week 8 (-1.67, 95% CI -2.85 to -0.48). Physical ability statistically increased from baseline to both week 4 (-0.85; 95% CI 1.49 to -0.20) and week 8 (-1.44; 95% CI -2.29 to -0.59). Nutrition statistically increased from baseline to both week 4 (0.67; 95% CI 0.05 to 1.28) and week 8 (1.10; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84). Smart Brain significantly improved cognitive function, reduced depression, and enhanced physical and nutritional status in older adults with dementia. This demonstrates its potential as an effective non-pharmacological intervention in community-based dementia care. Smart Brain's personalized approach, which integrates user-specific preferences and expert guidance, enhances engagement and goal achievement in dementia care. This enhances self-esteem and clinical outcomes, demonstrates the application's potential to innovate rehabilitation practices.
