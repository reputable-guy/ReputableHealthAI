Study Title: Yogistic efficacy on cardiopulmonary capacities, endurance efficiencies and musculoskeletal potentialities in female college students.

Study Summary:
Physical exercise participation among female students is significantly compromised throughout the academic periods of college or university due to scholastic demands and also by less parental and community encouragements. Thus, physical inactivity in female college students leads to less musculoskeletal efficiency and work performance. Customized yogic module may be considered to enhance both aerobic and anaerobic power, pulmonary capacity and musculoskeletal efficiency for the improvement of systemic body functions among female college students. A randomized, controlled parallel study design (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;60; age&#x200a;=&#x200a;20.16&#xb1;2.05 years), on sedentary female college students practicing customized yogic module (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;30) for 5 days / week for 3 months (60&#x200a;min daily in the morning) to observe anthropometric, physiological, cardiopulmonary and muscular endurance indices. After yogic practice, a significant reduction in body fat (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05) (%), heart rate (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001), systolic blood pressure (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001), double product (p&#x2039;0.01) and rate pressure product (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05) were estimated. Significant improvement (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001) in vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1&#x200a;sec was also observed. Evaluation of hand grip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and physical work capacity showed significant increase (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.01) after yogic intervention. A three-month customized yogic training improved resting physiological activities, cardiopulmonary functions, musculoskeletal strength and endurance fitness due to focused breathing, mindfulness meditation and by stretching-strengthening patterns for achieving recreational physical activity among female college students.
