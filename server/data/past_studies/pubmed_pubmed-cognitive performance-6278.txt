Study Title: Ketone Ester Supplementation Improves Some Aspects of Cognitive Function during a Simulated Soccer Match after Induced Mental Fatigue.

Study Summary:
Ketone supplementation has been proposed to enhance cognition during exercise. To assess whether any benefits are due to reduced cognitive fatigue during the latter portions of typical sport game action, we induced cognitive fatigue, provided a ketone monoester supplement (KME) vs. a non-caloric placebo (PLAC), and assessed cognitive performance during a simulated soccer match (SSM). In a double-blind, balanced, crossover design, nine recreationally active men (174.3 &#xb1; 4.2 cm, 76.6 &#xb1; 7.4 kg, 30 &#xb1; 3 y, 14.2 &#xb1; 5.5 % body fat, V&#x2d9;O2 max = 55 &#xb1; 5 mL&#xb7;kg BM&#x2212;1&#xb7;min&#x2212;1; mean &#xb1; SD) completed a 45-min SSM (3 blocks of intermittent, variable intensity exercise) consuming either KME (25 g) or PLAC, after a 40-min mental fatiguing task. Cognitive function (Stroop and Choice Reaction Task [CRT]) and blood metabolites were measured throughout the match. KME reduced concentrations of both blood glucose (block 2: 4.6 vs. 5.2 mM, p = 0.02; block 3: 4.7 vs. 5.3 mM, p = 0.01) and blood lactate (block 1: 4.7 vs. 5.4 mM, p = 0.05; block 2: 4.9 vs. 5.9 mM, p = 0.01) during the SSM vs. PLAC, perhaps indicating a CHO sparing effect. Both treatments resulted in impaired CRT performance during the SSM relative to baseline, but KME displayed a reduced (p < 0.05) performance decrease compared to PLAC (1.3 vs. 3.4% reduction in correct answers, p = 0.02). No other differences in cognitive function were seen. These data suggest that KME supplementation attenuated decrements in CRT during repeated, high intensity, intermittent exercise. More study is warranted to assess fully the potential cognitive/physical benefits of KME for athletes.
