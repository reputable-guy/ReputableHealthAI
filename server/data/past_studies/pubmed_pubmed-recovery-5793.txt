Study Title: The Influence of a Polyphenol-Rich Red Berry Fruit Juice on Recovery Process and Leg Strength Capacity after Six Days of Intensive Endurance Exercise in Recreational Endurance Athletes.

Study Summary:
Various nutritional strategies are increasingly used in sports to reduce oxidative stress and promote recovery. Chokeberry is rich in polyphenols and can reduce oxidative stress. Consequently, chokeberry juices and mixed juices with chokeberry content are increasingly used in sports. However, the data are very limited. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of the short-term supplementation of a red fruit juice drink with chokeberry content or a placebo on muscle damage, oxidative status, and leg strength during a six-day intense endurance protocol. Eighteen recreational endurance athletes participated in a cross-over high intensity interval training (HIIT) design, receiving either juice or a placebo. Baseline and post-exercise assessments included blood samples, anthropometric data, and leg strength measurements. A significant increase was measured in muscle damage following the endurance protocol in all participants (&#x2206; CK juice: 117.12 &#xb1; 191.75 U/L, &#x2206; CK placebo: 164.35 &#xb1; 267.00 U/L;= 0.001, &#x3b7;= 0.17). No group effects were detected in exercise-induced muscle damage (= 0.371, &#x3b7;= 0.010) and oxidative status (= 0.632, &#x3b7;= 0.000). The reduction in strength was stronger in the placebo group, but group effects are missing statistical significance (&#x2206; e1RM juice: 1.34 &#xb1; 9.26 kg, &#x2206; e1RM placebo: -3.33 &#xb1; 11.49 kg;= 0.988, &#x3b7;= 0.000). Although a reduction in strength can be interpreted for the placebo treatment, no statistically significant influence of chokeberry could be determined. It appears that potential effects may only occur with prolonged application and a higher content of polyphenols, but further research is needed to confirm this.
