Study Title: Stem cell collection and hematological recovery in the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) MCL0208 clinical trial.

Study Summary:
In the frontline high-dose phase 3 FIL-MCL0208 trial (NCT02354313), 8% of enrolled mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients could not be randomised to receive lenalidomide (LEN) maintenance vs observation after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) due to inadequate hematological recovery and 52% of those who started LEN, needed a dose reduction due to toxicity. We therefore focused on the role played by CD34&#x2009;+&#x2009;hematopoietic stem cells (PBSC) harvesting and reinfusion on toxicity and outcome. Overall, 90% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;245) of enrolled patients who underwent the first leukapheresis collected&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10PBSC/kg, 2.6% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7) mobilized&#x2009;<&#x2009;4&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10PBSC/kg and 7.7% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) failed the collection. Similar results were obtained for the planned second leukapheresis, with only one patient failing both attempts. Median count of reinfused PBSC was 5&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10/kg and median time to recovery from neutropenia G4 was 10&#xa0;days from ASCT. No impact of mobilizing subtype or number of reinfused PBSC on hematological recovery and LEN dose reduction was noted. At a median follow-up of 75&#xa0;months from ASCT, PFS and OS of transplanted patients were 50% and 73%, respectively. A long lasting G4 neutropenia after ASCT (>&#x2009;10&#xa0;days) was associated with a worse outcome, both in terms of PFS and OS. In conclusion, although the harvesting procedures proved feasible for younger MCL patients, long-lasting cytopenia following ASCT remains a significant issue: this can hinder the administration of effective maintenance therapies, potentially increasing the relapse rate and negatively affecting survival outcomes.
