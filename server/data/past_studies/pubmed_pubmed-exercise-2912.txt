Study Title: Are pelvic-abdominal mechanics exercises effective for cesarean delivery rate and postpartum pelvic floor function: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To examine the effectiveness of pelvic-abdominal mechanics exercise in reducing cesarean section rates and preventing pelvic floor dysfunction in primiparous women. Randomized controlled trial. A single-center prospective study was conducted among 200 primiparous participants (aged 18-38&#x202f;years) who undertook formal card-issuing maternity tests between June 1, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Participants were divided into two groups: exercise (intervention) and control using the random number table method. Participants of the intervention group performed pelvic-abdominal mechanics exercise at least 1&#x202f;h each time per week for three months. Participants of the control group did not perform any pelvic-abdominal mechanics exercise during pregnancy. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation from three perspectives, including maternal and neonatal health outcomes during delivery, the recovery status of pelvic floor muscles at 42&#x202f;days postpartum, and the quality of life during late pregnancy (36-38&#x202f;weeks) and 42&#x202f;days postpartum. A significant difference was found in delivery outcomes. The cesarean section rates are significantly higher (p&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.05) in the control group (36&#x202f;%) than in the exercise group (19&#x202f;%). At 42&#x202f;days postpartum, pelvic floor assessment showed that the exercise group had significantly better results in pelvic floor muscle strength compared to the control group, with statistical significance (p&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.05). Pelvic-abdominal mechanics exercise lowers the rate of cesarean section and improves postpartum pelvic floor function.
