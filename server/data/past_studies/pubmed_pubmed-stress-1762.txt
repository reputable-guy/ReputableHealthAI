Study Title: Randomized effectiveness-implementation trial of dialectical behavior therapy interventions for young people with borderline personality disorder symptoms.

Study Summary:
Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment for people with emerging borderline personality disorder (BPD). In "real world" clinical settings, standard DBT is resource intensive. Emerging evidence suggests that group-based DBT skills training alone can lead to promising outcomes. This hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial directly compared the effectiveness of an 8-week group DBT-skills training program and a 16-week DBT-informed program including individual treatment and group-based skills training. This pragmatic trial employed a staggered, parallel-groups design. We recruited 104 participants, aged 16-25 years, with emotion dysregulation or emerging BPD symptoms. Participants were randomized to receive either program at a youth mental health service located in the Gold Coast, Australia. Data was collected via online surveys at baseline, 8-week, 16-week, and 24-week follow-up. Mixed effect linear models compared groups on the primary outcomes of emotion dysregulation and BPD symptoms, and secondary outcomes of suicidal ideation, coping skills, depression, anxiety, and stress. Across groups there were significant and sustained improvements relating to emotion dysregulation, BPD symptoms, stress, depression, and emotion-focused coping; but not suicide risk, anxiety, or task-focused coping. There was no significant time by group differences between the 8-week and 16-week interventions on any primary or secondary outcome. The more intensive mode of delivering DBT was not more effective than the brief group-based skills training. Both interventions resulted in significant improvements across both primary and most secondary outcomes. These results have implications for clinical practice regarding length and intensity of DBT treatment in young people.
