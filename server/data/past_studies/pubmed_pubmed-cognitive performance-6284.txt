Study Title: One-year aerobic exercise increases cerebral blood flow in cognitively normal older adults.

Study Summary:
The impact of aerobic exercise training (AET) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation remains inconclusive. This study investigated the effects of one-year progressive, moderate-to-vigorous AET on CBF, central arterial stiffness, and cognitive performance in cognitively normal older adults. Seventy-three older adults were randomly assigned to AET or stretching-and-toning (SAT, active control) intervention. CBF was measured with 2D duplex ultrasonography. Central arterial stiffness, measured by carotid &#x3b2;-stiffness index, was assessed with the ultrasonography and applanation tonometry. Cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) was calculated as mean arterial pressure divided by CBF. A cognitive battery was administered with a focus on memory and executive function. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by peak oxygen consumption (O). One-year AET increasedOand CBF and decreased CVR and carotid &#x3b2;-stiffness index. In the AET group, improvedOwas correlated with increased CBF (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.621, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and decreased CVR (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.412, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037) and carotid &#x3b2;-stiffness index (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.478, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). Further, increased Woodcock-Johnson recall score was associated with decreased CVR (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.483, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012) and carotid &#x3b2;-stiffness index (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.498, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008) in AET group (not in SAT group). In conclusion, one-year progressive, moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise training increased CBF and decreased carotid arterial stiffness and CVR which were associated with improved memory function in cognitively normal older adults.
