Study Title: [Effect of He'smethod of acupuncture on serological levels in patients with acute ischaemic stroke].

Study Summary:
To investigate the repair effects of He'smethod of acupuncture (involved bloodletting technique with strong action of unblocking) on the neurovascular unit of the patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in terms of serological indicators so as to provide new ideas for the treatment of AIS. Seventy subjects with AIS were randomly divided into an observation group (35 cases, 1 case dropped out) and a control group (35 cases , 4 cases dropped out). Patients in the control group were treated with conventional regimen. In the observation group, the bloodletting was operated, combined with the conventional treatment. Bloodletting was performed at Baihui (GV20), Sishencong (EX-HN1) and bilateral Erjian (EX-HN6), using He'smethod of acupuncture, 3 times a week and for 2 weeks. Before and after treatment, the scores of the national institute of health stroke scale (NIHSS), the modified Rankin scale (MRS), and the Barthel index were evaluated&#xff1b;and the serological levels of the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and blood-brain barrier permeability-associated protein (S100&#x3b2; protein) were detected in the two groups. After treatment, NIHSS score and MRS score were decreased (<0.01), and Barthel score was increased (<0.01) in both groups. NIHSS score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group (<0.01). Compared with those before treatment, the content of BDNF in both groups increased (<0.05), and VEGF content was elevated in the observation group (<0.05) after treatment. The total effective rate was 100% (34/34) in the observation group, higher than that (67.74%, 21/31) in the control group (<0.01). He'smethod of acupuncture can promote the recovery of neurological deficits in AIS patients and effectively improve their motor function and the activity of daily living, which may be related to the reconstruction of neurovascular unit in the brain of AIS patients by increasing the levels of serological repair factors.
