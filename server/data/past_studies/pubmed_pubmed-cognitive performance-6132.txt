Study Title: Acute Effects of Naturally Occurring Guayusa Tea and Nordic Lion's Mane Extracts on Cognitive Performance.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of guayusa extract and Nordic Lion's Mane (LM) on cognition. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, we examined the effects of a single dose of 650 mg guayusa extract (AMT: AmaTeaMax) vs. 1 g Nordic-grown Lion's Mane (LM) vs. placebo (PL). Participants attended three testing visits consisting of neuropsychological tests (Go/No-go, N-Back, and Serial 7 s tasks) assessing performance, subjective assessments of cognitive perception, and vital signs. Each assessment was measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and 1 and 2 h post ingestion. AMT significantly (&#x2264; 0.05) improved the number of attempts during Serial 7s, total score, number of correct responses, total number of responses, and reaction time during N-Back and improved Go stimulus reaction time, but it reduced the percentage of correct responses in the No-go stimulus response during Go/No-go. LM significantly (&#x2264; 0.05) improved the number of attempts during Serial 7s and reaction time during N-Back and improved Go stimulus reaction time in Go/No-go. AMT improved mental clarity, focus, concentration, mood, and productivity at 1 and 2 h (< 0.05); the ability to tolerate stress at 1 h; and had greater ratings than LM and PL for mental clarity, focus, concentration, and productivity. PL improved focus and concentration at 1 h from baseline (&#x2264; 0.05). AMT and LM improved subjective ratings of "happiness compared to peers" and "getting the most out of everything" (< 0.05); however, this occurred earlier in LM (i.e., 1 h post ingestion). AMT uniquely elevated blood pressure from baseline. AMT significantly improved cognitive performance and self-perceived cognitive indices of affect over a 2 h period and perceptions of happiness 2 h post ingestion. In comparison, LM helped improve working memory, complex attention, and reaction time 2 h post ingestion and perceptions of happiness over a 2 h period.
