Study Title: Assessment of Efficacy and Safety of Mangifera indica Extract (Stadice&#xae;) for Cognitive Function: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Background and objectives Stadiceis a proprietary herbal ingredient preparation standardized to mangiferin, developed to support cognitive wellness in healthy adults.extract and its active constituent, mangiferin were known for its positive cognitive health benefits at experimental levels. This was an attempt to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Stadiceon healthy subjects. Materials and methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was designed to study the efficacy and safety of Stadice. Sixty healthy subjects who were regularly playing virtual/mobile/computer/laptop games online or offline were asked to consume a capsule containing 300 mg of Stadiceor placebo per day for seven days. Cognitive ability tests, that were part of the NIMHANS Neuropsychological Battery and Auditory verbal learning tests were used to assess the cognitive health effects. Psychological stress response, anxiety, mood, subjective working memory, and cortisol levels were also assessed. All assessments were carried out at the baseline and at the end of the study. Results Stadicewas found to significantly improve mental speed, attention, working memory, response inhibition, and verbal learning and memory as evidenced by the results of the multiple cognitive ability tests. Additionally, Stadiceshowed beneficial responses in managing psychological stress in terms of handling nervousness, irritability, or mood swings. No safety concerns were found in the laboratory safety test parameters as they were within the normal physiological range and no adverse events were reported in this study. Conclusion The proprietaryextract (Stadice) holds promise for enhancing cognitive abilities in healthy adults, particularly those engaged in esports. Improvements in learning, memory, mental speed, attention, response inhibition, and working memory among participants supplemented with Stadicewere observed with a good safety profile. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain its broader applicability as well as to elucidate the possible mechanisms.
