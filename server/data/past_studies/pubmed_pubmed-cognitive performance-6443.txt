Study Title: The effects of dynamic daylight-like light on the rhythm, cognition, and mood of irregular shift workers in closed environment.

Study Summary:
Shift workers are mostly suffered from the disruption of circadian rhythm and health problems. In this study, we designed proper light environment to maintain stable circadian rhythm, cognitive performance, and mood status of shift workers. We used five-channel light-emitting diodes to build up the dynamic daylight-like light environment. The illuminance, correlated color temperature, and circadian action factor of light were tunable in the ranges of 226 to 678&#xa0;lx, 2680 to 7314&#xa0;K, and 0.32 to 0.96 throughout the day (5:30 to 19:40). During the nighttime, these parameters maintained about 200&#xa0;lx, 2700&#xa0;K, and 0.32, respectively. In this light environment, three subjects had engaged in shift work for 38 consecutive days. We measured plasma melatonin, activity counts, continuous performance tests, and visual analogue scale on mood to assess the rhythm, cognitive performance, and mood of subjects. After 38-day shift work, the subjects' peak melatonin concentration increased significantly. Their physiological and behavioral rhythms maintained stable. Their cognitive performance improved significantly after night work, compared with that before night work. Their mood status had no significant change during the 38-day shift work. These results indicated that the light environment was beneficial to maintain circadian rhythm, cognitive performance and mood status during long-term shift work in closed environment.
