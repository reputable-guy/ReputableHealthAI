Study Title: A Fullerton Functional Fitness Test-based exercise intervention for older adults yields quick physical and psychological benefits.

Study Summary:
Functional fitness is essential for healthy living in older adults. Specially targeted fitness programs might be the most beneficial. This intervention study aimed to assess the efficacy of a specific 16-week exercise program in improving functions as measured by the Fullerton Functional Fitness Test (FFFT), also known as the Senior Test, in older adults. Thirty-eight participants (66&#xa0;% women, M&#xa0;=&#xa0;80.15, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.21) were randomized into an exercise group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24) and a waiting list control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;14). The exercise group trained three times a week for 1&#xa0;h. Objective tests (FFFT and handgrip power) and subjective psychological measures (life satisfaction, resilience, happiness, perceived stress, and well-being) were obtained at baseline, after eight weeks, and after 16 weeks. The data were analyzed using mixed-effect regression models. The results yielded statistically significant group-by-time interactions in all models, indicating improvements in physical and psychological measures over time in the treatment group compared to the control group. Significant differences between the groups in the estimated marginal means (with adjusted 95&#xa0;% confidence intervals) emerged after 16 weeks in happiness (-3.5 [-6.5, -0.4]), resilience (-5.5 [-9.9, -1.2]), perceived stress (2.2 [0.2, 4.2]), well-being (-5.8 [-7.9, -3.6]), upper limb strength (-5.7 [-9.0, -2.4]), upper body flexibility (-8.7 [-16.4, -1.0]), and agility and balance (4.6 [1.2, 8.1]). Except for happiness and resilience, these differences surfaced already after eight weeks. The here-employed 16-week exercise program, targeting the test elements of the FFFT, efficiently induced physical and mental improvements in older adults.
