Study Title: Mediating Effects of Thought Suppression in the Relationship Between Mindfulness and Substance Use Craving.

Study Summary:
: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant issue in the United States, characterized by chronic relapse following periods of abstinence. One of the primary precursors to relapse is craving. Findings from several studies have shown a negative association between trait mindfulness and craving in clinical samples; however, further research is needed to understand mechanisms underlying this relationship.: The current study assessed thought suppression as a partial mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness and craving.: The current study used data from a previous randomized controlled trial of adults (&#x2009;=&#x2009;244) enrolled in community-based treatment for substance use disorder (SUD).: Analyses showed a significant moderate positive association between thought suppression and craving, a significant moderate negative association between thought suppression and trait mindfulness, and a significant moderate negative association between trait mindfulness and craving. Subsequent analyses confirmed a partial mediating role of thought suppression in the relationship between trait mindfulness and craving, indicating the inverse relationship between trait mindfulness and craving was partially explained by thought suppression.: These findings may inform treatment for SUD. Specifically, targeting thought suppression through mindfulness-based treatment approaches may be a mechanism through which craving can be reduced.
