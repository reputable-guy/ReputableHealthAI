Study Title: Investigating the Effect of a Multicomponent Exercise Program on Adropin, Endothelial Function, Insulin Resistance, and Sleep Quality in Overweight Older Adults (a Link With Physiological Indexes and Sleep Quality): Results of a Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of multicomponent training on adropin, endothelial function, insulin resistance, and sleep quality in overweight older adults. In this randomized controlled study, 40 overweight older adults were randomly divided into training and control groups. The multicomponent training program including aerobic, resistance, and balance exercise was followed for 8&#xa0;weeks, 3&#xa0;days a week. Study variables were measured 48&#xa0;hr before and after the intervention. After 8&#xa0;weeks of multicomponent training, adropin (p = .01), nitric oxide (p = .01), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max; p = .002) increased, and glucose (p = .001), insulin (p = .001), insulin resistance (p = .01), systolic blood pressure (p = .01), and sleep disorders (p = .01) decreased significantly. Also, Pearson's test results showed a significant inverse relationship between adropin level (p = .01 and r = -.55) and glucose (p = .01 and r = -.51) with sleep disorders. It seems that multicomponent training increases adropin and improves insulin resistance, endothelial function, and sleep quality in older adults.
