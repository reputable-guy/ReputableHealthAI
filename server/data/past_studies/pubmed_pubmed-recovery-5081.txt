Study Title: Effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on acute postoperative breast augmentation pain: study protocol.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study is to describe a protocol for evaluating the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on pain following breast augmentation surgery. Fifty-four women will be randomly allocated into two groups: active TENS and placebo. Pain will be assessed at rest and during movement, before and immediately after TENS application. Secondary outcomes include pain one-hour post-treatment, respiratory muscle strength, patient satisfaction, and analgesic use in the first four hours post-surgery. The results of this clinical trial could enhance the management of post-operative pain in breast augmentation surgery using non-pharmacological interventions, potentially reducing costs and improving patient experience.Clinical Trial Registration: RBR-96h3k97.
