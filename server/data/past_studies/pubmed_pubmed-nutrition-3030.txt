Study Title: Exercise Training Counteracts Compromised Mitochondrial Capacity Induced by Energy Restriction in Prediabetics in a Sex-Dependent Manner.

Study Summary:
The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to examine if exercise training can counteract energy restriction-induced impairment of mitochondrial capacity in skeletal muscle of 55-70-years people with prediabetes and metabolic syndrome. The potential impact of sex was explored. Fifty sedentary men and women with prediabetes and metabolic syndrome (age: 61&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6 (&#xb1;SD) years, BMI: 29.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.7&#x2009;kg&#xb7;m, body fat content: 37.5%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.2% and VO: 22.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.7&#x2009;mL&#xb7;min&#xb7;kg) were randomized to either exercise training and dietary advice (EX-DI) or dietary advice only (DI). Dietary advice aimed to induce weight loss and improve glycemic control. Exercise consisted of 32&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2 mixed 30-60&#x2009;min training sessions with recreational small-sided soccer distributed across 16&#x2009;weeks. Maximal activity and protein abundance of key regulatory mitochondrial enzymes were determined in m. vastus lateralis pre- and post-intervention. Muscle glycogen content was also determined. Dietary advice only (DI), impaired (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) citrate synthase (CS), and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) maximal activity by 18%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;43% and 23%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;19%, respectively. When combined with exercise training, no dietary impairment of CS or HAD maximal activity was detectable. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and CS protein expression also declined (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) in DI and remained unchanged in EX-DI. In terms of sex differences, a decrease in maximal CS activity in both EX-DI and DI was observed exclusively in men (all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In conclusion, 16&#x2009;weeks of exercise training counteracts energy restriction-induced impairment in skeletal mitochondrial function in 55- to 70-year-old women and men with prediabetes and metabolic syndrome.
