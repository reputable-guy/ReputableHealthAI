Study Title: The impact of a walking program on self-management, anxiety, stress, depression, quality of life, and seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy: A mixed methods approach using the COM-B behaviour change model.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effect of a walking program based on the COM-B Behavior Change Model on self-management, anxiety, stress, depression, quality of life, and seizure frequency in individuals with epilepsy. A prospective, parallel-group controlled experimental design and mixed methods were used. A total of 78 individuals with epilepsy were included in the study and randomly assigned to the intervention (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38) and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40) groups. The intervention group participated in a weekly, twice-a-week, walking program for 12 weeks. The program was based on the COM-B model, focusing on increasing individuals' capability, opportunity, and motivation levels. The control group received standard treatment. Self-management, anxiety, stress, depression, and quality of life were measured using scales. Seizure frequency was measured using daily logs. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 10 participants to understand barriers to walking in individuals with epilepsy. Qualitative data revealed time constraints, lack of motivation, and safety concerns as barriers to walking participation. After a 12-week intervention, a significant increase in self-management levels, a significant decrease in anxiety, stress, and depression levels, a significant improvement in quality of life, and a significant reduction in seizure frequency were observed in the intervention group. No significant changes were observed in these variables in the control group. This study demonstrated that a walking program based on the COM-B Behavior Change Model had a positive impact on self-management, mental health, and quality of life in individuals with epilepsy and may help reduce seizure frequency.
