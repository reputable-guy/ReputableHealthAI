Study Title: High-Carbohydrate Energy Intake During a Round of Golf-Maintained Blood Glucose Levels, Inhibited Energy Deficiencies, and Prevented Fatigue: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group Comparison Study.

Study Summary:
This study primarily aimed to examine the optimal amount of carbohydrates in the effects of high-isomaltulose and high-sucrose ingestion compared with low-sucrose ingestion on blood glucose levels. The secondary objective was to assess the changes in blood glucose levels that may impact golf-related performance. This study included 29 healthy male competitive golfers playing 18 holes. These participants were randomly assigned to the low-sucrose (LSUC, 30.9 g/h of carbohydrates), high-sucrose (HSUC, 44.2 g/h of carbohydrates), and high-isomaltulose (HISO, 44.5 g/h of carbohydrates) groups. They were required to continuously consume the test food during the round. Assessment items included blood glucose, golf performance, urinary urea nitrogen, subjective ratings (concentration, fatigue, and relaxation), and anxiety ratings. A main effect of the test meal of changes in interstitial glucose concentration was determined. The HSUC had significantly more interstitial glucose than the HISO and LSUC, while the HISO group had a much lower decrease in urine urea nitrogen than the LSUC group. In subjective fatigue, the main effect of the test diet was observed, and the HSUC and HISO showed significantly lower values than the LSUC after 18 h. Compared with low-carbohydrate intake, high-carbohydrate intake during a round of golf-maintained the blood glucose levels and prevented fatigue. Therefore, this study indicates that competitive golfers need a high-carbohydrate intake of approximately 44 g/h for energy intake during a round of golf.
