Study Title: Effects of a Long-Term Supervised Schroth Exercise Program on the Severity of Scoliosis and Quality of Life in Individuals with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial Study.

Study Summary:
: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) affects individuals aged 10-18 years and is characterized by spinal deformity, three-dimensional axis deformation, and vertebral rotation. Schroth method exercises and braces have been shown to reduce the Cobb angle and halt spinal deformity progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a 12-month, supervised Schroth exercise program on scoliosis severity and quality of life in adolescents with AIS.: Eighty adolescents with AIS (aged 10-17 years) were prescribed a brace and were divided into two groups. The intervention group followed a supervised Schroth exercise program three times a week for 12 months in addition to wearing a brace. The control group used only the brace. Outcomes included the Cobb angle of the main curvature and the sum of curves using radiography, the maximum angle of trunk rotation (ATR maximum, using a scoliometer), and quality of life with the Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire. Evaluations were conducted at baseline, after 12 months, and 6 months post-intervention. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used for statistical analysis (-Value < 0.05).: The intervention group showed statistically significant improvement compared to the control group in the 12th month in Cobb angle (mean differences, 95% CI: -3.65 (-5.81, -1.53),-Value < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.30), ATR maximum (mean differences, 95% CI: -3.05 (-3.86, -2.23),-Value < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.74), and SRS-22 score (mean differences, 95% CI: 0.87 (0.60, 1.13),-Value < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.58). Differences in ATR maximum and SRS-22 score remained significant at the 18-month measurement. No significant differences were found between groups in the sum of curves (-Value > 0.05).: A 12-month supervised Schroth exercise program in AIS patients undergoing brace treatment significantly improves scoliosis severity (Cobb angle and ATR maximum) and quality of life. Improvements were greater than those in shorter-duration studies, suggesting a linear dose-response relationship. Further clinical studies are needed to clarify the impact of long-term Schroth programs.
