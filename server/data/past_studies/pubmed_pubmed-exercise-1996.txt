Study Title: Effect of Multi-component Exercise Program on Body Composition and Physical, Emotional and Social well being in Breast Cancer Survivors.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this research intended to determine the impact of an multi-component exercise program on body composition and physical, emotional and social well being (PWB, EWB,SWB) in breast cancer survivors (BCS). &#xa0;Methods: One hundred and thirty two eight women with BC were enrolled in this research based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomized into group A and B. Group A received breast cancer (BC) support group therapy whereas group B received multi-component exercise program. Waist Hip ratio (WHR), Body Mass Index (BMI), Circumference measurement and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy &#xa0;Breast (FACT-B) scale were employed as outcome measures. To validate the outcomes, pre- and post-assessments of the mentioned measures were conducted. Statistical evaluation was conducted with SPSS statistical software (version 26.0). The findings revealed considerable improvement among the group for homolateral and contralateral arm and forearm, right and left thigh and right and left leg circumference (p=0.0087,0.0162, 0.0061, 0.0048, 0.0266,0.0142,0.0364, 0.0021), FACT-B (p=0.008, 0.002, 0.007,0.01,0.001,<0.0001), conversely no significant enhancement was observed for BMI (p=0.743) and WHR (p=0.6614) of patients undergoing multi-component exercise as compared to other group. Also, significant improvement between the groups was observed for circumference(0.0478,0.0305,0.0279,0.0240,0.0374,0.0293,0.0420,0.0334,0.0449,0.0260,0.0412 ,0.0160,0.0454,0.0324,0.0375,0.0214), FACT-B (0.51, 0.045, 0.313, 0.238, 0.593, 0.049, 0.405, <0.0001, &#xa0;0.190, 0.015,0.131,0.176,0.006,<0.0001), conversely no significant enhancement was observed for BMI (p=0.9634, 0.364), WHR (p=0.988, 0.915) at post treatment 6 month and 1 year. The study concluded that multi-component exercise program had shown a significant effect on body composition and PWB, EWB, SWB among BCS.
