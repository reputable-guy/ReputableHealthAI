Study Title: The relationship between emotional intelligence, resilience, and psychological distress among nurses in Jordan.

Study Summary:
Nurses have significant levels of depression, anxiety, and stress as a result of their exposure to various stressors at work. Emotional intelligence and resilience are relatively new notions essential for nurses to naturalize high levels of psychological problems. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence and resilience and their impact on depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used and recruited 152 nurses from three private hospitals in Jordan. Variables were measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, and Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale. The participants' average age was 27.6&#xa0;years, and they were mostly female (66.4&#xa0;%). Resilience earned an average of 3.1, while emotional intelligence averaged 31.7. Depression, anxiety, and stress were all significantly higher among nurses. Also, negative relationships were found between emotional intelligence, resilience, and psychological problems (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001). Emotional intelligence is positively associated with resilience (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.83, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001). In addition, emotional intelligence and resilience were both significant predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress. Emotional intelligence is critical to nurses' well-being. Higher emotional intelligence is associated with higher resilience and lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses. Interventions and education programs emphasizing emotional intelligence and resilience are essential to improving their mental health. Healthcare organizations and governments should promote these attributes to enhance nurses' psychological wellness in challenging healthcare settings.
