Study Title: Age-related changes to oscillatory dynamics during maintenance and retrieval in a relational memory task.

Study Summary:
In aging, structural and/or functional brain changes may precede changes in cognitive performance. We previously showed that despite having hippocampal volumes similar to those of younger adults, older adults showed oscillatory changes during the encoding phase of a short-delay visuospatial memory task that required spatial relations among objects to be bound across time (Rondina et al., 2016). The present work provides a complementary set of analyses to examine age-related changes in oscillatory activity during maintenance and retrieval of those spatial relations in order to provide a comprehensive examination of the neural dynamics that support memory function in aging. Participants were presented with three study objects sequentially. Following a delay (maintenance phase), the objects were re-presented simultaneously and participants had to determine whether the relative spatial relations among the objects had been maintained (retrieval phase). Older adults had similar task accuracy, but slower response times, compared to younger adults. Both groups showed a decrease in theta (2-7Hz), alpha (9-14Hz), and beta (15-30Hz) power during the maintenance phase. During the retrieval phase, younger adults showed theta and beta power increases that predicted greater task accuracy, whereas older adults showed a widespread decrease in each of the three frequency ranges that predicted longer response latencies. Older adults also showed distinct patterns of behaviour-related activity depending on whether the analysis was time-locked to the onset of the stimulus or to the onset of the response during the test phase. These findings suggest that older adults may experience declines in relational binding and/or comparison processes that are reflected in oscillatory changes prior to structural decline.
