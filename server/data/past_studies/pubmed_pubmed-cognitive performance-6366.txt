Study Title: Multimodal investigation of the association between shift work and the brain in a population-based sample of older adults.

Study Summary:
Neuropsychological studies reported that shift workers show reduced cognitive performance and circadian dysfunctions which may impact structural and functional brain networks. Here we tested the hypothesis whether night shift work is associated with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), cortical thickness and gray matter volume in participants of the 1000BRAINS study for whom information on night shift work and imaging data were available. 13 PRESENT and 89 FORMER night shift workers as well as 430 control participants who had never worked in shift (NEVER) met these criteria and were included in our study. No associations between night shift work, three graph-theoretical measures of RSFC of 7 functional brain networks and brain morphology were found after multiple comparison correction. Preceding multiple comparison correction, our results hinted at an association between more years of shift work and higher segregation of the visual network in PRESENT shift workers and between shift work experience and lower gray matter volume of the left thalamus. Extensive neuropsychological investigations supplementing objective imaging methodology did not reveal an association between night shift work and cognition after multiple comparison correction. Our pilot study suggests that night shift work does not elicit general alterations in brain networks and affects the brain only to a limited extent. These results now need to be corroborated in studies with larger numbers of participants.
