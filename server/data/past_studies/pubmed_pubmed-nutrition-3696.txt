Study Title: An Education Intervention to Increase Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Confidence and Acceptability: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To explore the effect of an intervention to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination confidence, attitudes, and beliefs among non-Hispanic Black mothers. Participants were 63 non-Hispanic Black mothers of children aged 9-17 years who resided in the United States and whose children had not received HPV vaccination. Interventions and data collection were conducted via a videoconferencing platform. A randomized controlled trial was performed using two groups. The experimental group received two HPV vaccination education sessions and the control group received two healthy nutrition education sessions. Data were collected after the last intervention and four weeks later. Variables included HPV vaccination confidence, attitudes, and beliefs. The experimental group reported more positive attitudes and beliefs about HPV vaccination (p = 0.002) and greater vaccination confidence than the control group (p = 0.049). Nurses can improve HPV vaccination confidence, attitudes, and beliefs among non-Hispanic Black mothers through HPV vaccination education.
