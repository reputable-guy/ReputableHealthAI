Study Title: The effectiveness of group interpersonal synchrony in young autistic adults' work environment: A mixed methods RCT study protocol.

Study Summary:
Few autistic adults are able to integrate successfully into the world of work given their difficulties adapting to the social and stressful aspects of work environments. Interpersonal synchrony, when two or more individuals share body movements or sensations, is a powerful force that consolidates human groups while promoting the ability to self-regulate and cooperate with others. The abilities to self-regulate and cooperate are crucial for maintaining a calm and productive work environment. This study protocol outlines research that aims to assess the effects of group interpersonal synchrony on prosociality and work-related stress of young autistic adults in their work environment. This mixed-methods randomized controlled trial will investigate two movement-based group synchronous and non-synchronous intervention conditions. The sample will be composed of young adults enrolled in an innovative Israeli program designed to integrate cognitively-abled 18- to 25-year-old autistic adults into the Israeli army work force. The movement-based intervention sessions will take place in groups of 10-14 participants, once a week for 10 weeks. Questionnaires, behavioral collaborative tasks and semi-structured interviews will be conducted. Quantitative data will be collected for each participant at three points of time: before and after the intervention period, and 17 weeks after the end of the intervention. Qualitative data will be collected after the intervention period in interviews with the participants. Little is known about interventions that promote successful integration into social and stressful work environments. The findings are likely to shed new light on the use of group interpersonal synchrony in autistic individuals at work. NCT05846308.
