Study Title: Educational intervention on perceived stress among adults with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome: a non-randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the effectiveness of an educational intervention on perceived stress and metabolic syndrome parameters among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fifty-one adults (aged 48.73&#xb1;7.84; 86.3% of women) were included in a non-randomized clinical trial performed in a healthcare unit for six months (Brazilian Clinical Trial Registry: RBR-43K52N). All participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (intervention group, n=26; control group, n=25). The intervention consisted of a nurse-led educational health-promoting program with a multidisciplinary approach organized in seven workshops. The primary outcome was decreased perceived stress, and the secondary outcome was improvement in metabolic syndrome parameters according to perceived stress levels. These outcomes were assessed at two points in time, at the baseline and follow-up. Participation in the intervention program resulted in a significant decrease in perceived stress (p=0.028). The stressed participants in the intervention group experienced a significant decrease in blood glucose levels (p=0.001) and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p=0.003) concentrations after the six-month intervention. The nurse-led educational health-promoting program decreased perceived stress among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, improving fasting blood glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol among the stressed participants in the intervention group.
