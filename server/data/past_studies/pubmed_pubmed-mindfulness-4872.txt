Study Title: The Mindful Lawyer: Investigating the Effects of Two Online Mindfulness Programs on Self-Reported Well-Being in the Legal Profession.

Study Summary:
Two studies were conducted to determine whether mindfulness meditation could be an effective tool for improving well-being among legal professionals-a population plagued by high rates of depression, anxiety, and stress. Study 1. Legal professionals completed questionnaires before and after an 8-week mindfulness program. Study 2. Lawyers were randomly assigned to either an experimental or waitlist condition. Questionnaires were administered at the beginning of the study and after experimental participants had completed a 30-day intervention. Study 1. Participants reported significant improvements in mood, resilience, trait mindfulness, stress, anxiety, and depression over time. Study 2. Post-intervention, experimental participants reported better mood, lower levels of stress, and higher levels of non-reactivity and observing than waitlist participants. Mindfulness and meditation may effectively improve well-being among legal professionals.
