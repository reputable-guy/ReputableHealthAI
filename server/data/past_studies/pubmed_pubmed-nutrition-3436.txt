Study Title: Influence of gastric residual assessment in preterm neonates on time to achieve enteral feeding (the GRASS trial)-Multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Gastric residual measurement is routinely performed in premature infants prior to feeding despite a lack of evidence of benefit. We aimed to evaluate if the exclusion of routine gastric residual measurement and evaluation has an impact on the time taken to achieve full enteral feeding in preterm neonates. International multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Clinically stable, appropriate for gestational age infants between 26and 30&#xa0;weeks of gestation and less than 1.5&#xa0;kg birth weight were eligible. Infants were randomised to the intervention arm (no monitoring of gastric aspirates) or control arm (routine care). Primary outcome was the achievement of enteral feeds of 100&#xa0;ml/kg/day by day 5 of life. Ninety-five infants were recruited with 88 included in an intention-to-treat analysis, 45 in the&#xa0;intervention&#xa0;arm and 43 in the control arm. There was no imbalance in baseline characteristics. Thirty-three (73.3%) infants in the intervention group and 32 infants (74.4%) in the control group reached full feeds by day 5 of life (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91) with no difference in median time to full feeds. There were no statistically significant differences in survival or the major morbidities of prematurity. &#xa0;There was no difference in time to attainment of enteral feeds of 100&#xa0;ml/kg/day in premature infants when gastric residuals were not monitored. In the absence of a clinical benefit to routine monitoring, it may be appropriate to discontinue this practice and only monitor residuals when clinical concern of feeding intolerance or gastrointestinal pathology arises in this group of patients. &#xa0;NCT03111329- https://clinicaltrials.gov/ . Registered 06/04/2017. &#x2022; Previous randomized trials have shown little benefit to the performance of routine assessment of gastric residuals in preterm infants. Despite this, they continue to be performed due to concerns from observational data regarding development of NEC. Meta-analysis to date has failed to answer the question regarding NEC. &#x2022; In very low birth weight infants who are fed using modern feeding practice of faster feed advancement, to minimize use of central access and parenteral nutrition, exclusion of routine checks of gastric residuals did not increase the proportion of infants reaching full enteral feeds by day 5. No harm was seen when residual checks were not performed. &#x2022; In the absence of a clinical benefit to the routine performance of gastric residuals in very low birth weight infants, it may be appropriate to discontinue their use and instead check residuals when clinical concern of pathology arises.
