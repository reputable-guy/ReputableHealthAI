Study Title: Advantages of remimazolam for sedation in impacted tooth extraction.

Study Summary:
This study aims to compare the sedative effects of remimazolam and midazolam during impacted tooth extraction to provide a comfortable sedation treatment for patients with dental anxiety. A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which 60 patients undergoing intravenous sedation for mandibular impacted third molar extraction were evenly divided into either the remimazolam or midazolam group. Prior to receiving a nerve blocker, the patients were sedated with remimazolam or midazolam. Various parameters were recorded and analyzed, including onset time, awakening time, recovery time, modified dental anxiety scale (MDAS) scores before and after surgery, patient-doctor satisfaction levels, postoperative side effects within 24 hours, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at different time points. Compared with the midazolam group, patients in the remimazolam group demonstrated significantly shorter onset, awakening, and recovery times as well as lower postoperative MDAS scores and higher levels of patient-doctor satisfaction. Fewer postoperative side effects were reported in the remimazolam group, although the differences were not statistically significant. The use of remimazolam demonstrates faster onset and recovery, superior efficacy in reducing dental anxiety, and enhanced satisfaction among patients and doctors, thereby presenting distinct advantages for sedation treatment for patients with dental anxiety.
