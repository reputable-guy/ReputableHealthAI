Study Title: A live online exercise program for older adults improves depression and life-space mobility: A mixed-methods pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Aging is the primary risk factor for sarcopenia and mobility limitations. Exercise reduces these risks, but older adults have low levels of participation in physical activity and exercise. We investigated the preliminary effectiveness of a live, online exercise program on community-dwelling older adults' physical activity levels. A mixed-method pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted according to CONSORT 2010 statement: extension for pilot and feasibility trials. Sedentary older adults (65-80 years) were randomly assigned to the online exercise intervention (ACTIVE) or a waitlist control (CON) group. Outcomes were measured pre-randomization and following the 8-week intervention for ACTIVE and CON and two months following the end of the intervention for the ACTIVE group. Outcomes included habitual physical activity levels, depression, anxiety, loneliness, life-space mobility, nutrition risk, and feasibility. All participants were invited to participate post-intervention in individual semi-structured qualitative interviews. Reporting of the qualitative research followed the checklist for the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting research. Seventeen older adults (71% women) were allocated to ACTIVE group, while 15 were allocated to CON group (87% women). Following the intervention, participants in the ACTIVE group reported reduced symptoms of depression (ACTIVE: pre = 4.2 &#xb1; 2.5; post = 2.2 &#xb1; 1.9; CON: pre = 3.5 &#xb1; 2.1, post = 3.5 &#xb1; 2.1; p <0.001) and improved life-space mobility (ACTIVE: pre = 62.4 &#xb1; 14.7; post = 71.8 &#xb1; 16.0; CON: pre = 65.1 &#xb1; 19.0, post = 63.6 &#xb1; 22.0; p = 0.003) compared to waitlist control participants. The ACTIVE group had good adherence (97%) and acceptability (98%). Twenty-two participants participated in qualitative interviews. Five themes were identified, including (1) Feasibility of the online exercise program; (2) Perceived health benefits and improvements; (3) Registered Kinesiologists and Physiotherapists contributed to perceived safety; (4) Social connectivity associated with synchronous/live delivery; and (5) Growing old gracefully and preventing disability. Our online exercise program was acceptable to older adults, had good adherence, reduced depression, and increased life space. Participants reported improved functional and mental health benefits. Further research is warranted to expand on these findings. NCT04627493; 13/11/2020.
