Study Title: Preliminary Findings From a Pilot Professional Coaching Program on the Components of Burnout in a Diverse Group of Physician Leaders.

Study Summary:
Burnout impacts physicians at alarming rates; physician leaders are not immune. While burnout of physician leaders is associated with decreased leadership efficacy, physician coaching has been associated with reduced burnout. This study aimed to assess the effect of a physician-leader specific coaching program on the components of burnout. A 10-week Wellness Coaching Program for physician medical directors was conducted and burnout was measured pre and post intervention using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS). All subscales of the MBI-GS trended towards a decrease in the components of burnout with a statistically significant decrease in Cynicism. Wellness coaching programs have the potential to positively impact the threat of burnout experienced by physician leaders in today's health care workforce.
