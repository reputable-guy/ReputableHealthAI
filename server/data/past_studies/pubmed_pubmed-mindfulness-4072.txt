Study Title: Art, meditation and cognitive science: a framework for museum-based community meditation programme during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore.

Study Summary:
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused mandatory lockdowns worldwide, exacerbating mental health issues created by social isolation. Aimed to improve mental health and maintain engagement, the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) rapidly deployed an online programme called Unwind with SAM to engage the public with the museum's contemporary art collection coupled with meditation. The programme focused on the positive effect of arts on mental health, combined with the cognitive benefits of meditation by 'slow-looking' at artworks. This practice-based report reflects on the processes and explores the potential between art, contemplation and cognitive sciences. The first section outlines the current landscape of art and wellness approaches in museums. The second section explains the philosophical framework that guides the programme, alongside a breakdown of components and design rationale. The final part provides a critical reflection and concludes with recommendations for practitioners, managers and scientists to utilise the framework for designing future programmes.
