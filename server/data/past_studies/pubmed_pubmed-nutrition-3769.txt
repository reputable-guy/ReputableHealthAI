Study Title: The Effects of Yogurt Supplementation and Nutritional Education on Malnourished Infants: A Pilot RCT in Dhaka's Slums.

Study Summary:
Our objective was to quantify the effects of yogurt supplementation and nutrition education over three months on the linear growth of infants at risk of stunting. We conducted a three-arm pilot randomized controlled trial: (1) nutrition education for mothers; (2) nutrition education plus a daily yogurt supplement (50 g) for the index child; and (3) usual care (control). Dyads of children aged 4-6 months and at risk of stunting [length-for-age z-score (LAZ) &#x2264; -1 SD and >-2 SD] and their mothers with &#x2264;10 years of education were eligible for the study. Participants were recruited from five slum areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Intention-to-treat (N = 162) and complete-case analyses (N = 127) showed no between-group statistically significant differences in LAZ or weight-for-age (WAZ). However, the yogurt group showed greater change in linear growth compared to the control (LAZ: mean difference 0.20, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.47,-value 0.13), which was also slightly greater than the education-only group. Children in the yogurt plus group were five times (95% CI: 0.80, 31.80,-value 0.09) more likely to meet the minimum dietary diversity (MDD) score compared to the control. A 3-month follow-up of this pilot study did not demonstrate that yogurt was beneficial to linear growth. However, there were encouraging trends that merit replication of the intervention with larger samples and longer follow-ups.
