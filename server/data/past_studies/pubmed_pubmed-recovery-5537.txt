Study Title: The Biological Effect of Platelet-Rich Plasma on Rotator Cuff Tears: A Prospective Randomized In Vivo Study.

Study Summary:
The positive effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on tendon metabolism has been extensively investigated and proven in vitro. Additionally, in vivo animal studies have correlated the application of PRP with the enhancement of tenocyte anabolic activity in the setting of tendon degeneration. However, less is known about its in vivo effect on human tendon biology. The purpose of the current prospective randomized comparative study was to evaluate the effect of PRP on torn human supraspinatus tendon. Twenty consecutive eligible patients with painful and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-confirmed degenerative supraspinatus tendon tears were randomized in a one-to-one ratio into two groups. The patients in the experimental group (= 10) underwent an ultrasound-guided autologous PRP injection in the subacromial space 6 weeks before the scheduled operation. In the control group (= 10), no injection was made prior to surgery. Supraspinatus tendon specimens were harvested from the lateral end of the torn tendon during shoulder arthroscopy and were evaluated under optical and electron microscopy. In the control group, a mixed cell population of oval and rounded tenocytes within disorganized collagen and sites of accumulated inflammatory cells was detected. In contrast, the experimental group yielded abundant oval-shaped cells with multiple cytoplasmic processes within mainly parallel collagen fibers and less marked inflammation, simulating the intact tendon structure. These findings indicate that PRP can induce microscopic changes in the ruptured tendon by stimulating the healing process and can facilitate a more effective recovery.
