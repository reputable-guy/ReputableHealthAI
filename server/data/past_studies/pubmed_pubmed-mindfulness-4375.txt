Study Title: The Impact of Mindfulness Treatment on Maternal Inflammation and Fetal Neurodevelopment Among Participants with Histories of Hypertensive Disorders.

Study Summary:
This was a secondary analysis of a prenatal mindfulness training (MT) RCT versus treatment as usual (TAU) on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a measure of maternal inflammation, and fetal head circumference. Fifteen participants were randomized to MT and 14 to TAU. NLR in third trimester was significantly lower in the MT group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.11,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019) relative to those in TAU. Higher NLR values in second (&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.644,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and third trimesters (&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.601,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030) were associated with lower fetal HC%. There was no group difference in fetal HC%. A future, fully powered study is needed to replicate these findings. Clinical Trials Number: NCT03679117.
