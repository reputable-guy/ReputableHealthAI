Study Title: Bifidobacterium longum 1714 improves sleep quality and aspects of well-being in healthy adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Stress and sleep are linked with overall well-being. Bifidobacterium longum 1714 has been shown to influence stress responses and modulate neural responses during social stress, and influence sleep quality during examination stress in healthy adults. Here, we explored the ability of this strain to alter sleep quality in adults using subjective and objective measures. Eighty-nine adults (18-45y) with impaired sleep quality assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and with a global score&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;5 were randomized to receive B. longum 1714 or placebo daily for eight weeks. Assessing the effect of the strain on PSQI global score was the primary objective. Secondary objectives assessed sleep quality and well-being subjectively and sleep parameters using actigraphy objectively. While PSQI global score improved in both groups, B. longum 1714 significantly improved the PSQI component of sleep quality (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) after 4&#xa0;weeks and social functioning (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and energy/vitality (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) after 8&#xa0;weeks, compared to placebo. No significant effect on actigraphy measures were observed. The 1714 strain had a mild effect on sleep, demonstrated by a faster improvement in sleep quality at week 4 compared to placebo, although overall improvements after 8&#xa0;weeks were similar in both groups. B. longum 1714 improved social functioning and increased energy/vitality in line with previous work that showed the strain modulated neural activity which correlated with enhanced vitality/reduced mental fatigue (ClinicalTrials.gov:&#xa0;NCT04167475).
