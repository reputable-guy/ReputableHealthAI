Study Title: Psychedelic Art and Implications for Mental Health: Randomized Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Psychedelic art (PA) emerged in the 1960s during the psychedelic era; then characterized by visuals induced by the ingestion of psychedelic drugs, it is now an art form known for its vibrant colors, distorted forms, and intricate patterns. Building upon the existing research on art viewing as an effective means to improving physiological and psychological well-being, viewing PA is postulated to evoke positive emotions and provide a meditative experience, contributing to improved mental well-being. This study aims to investigate how digitally rendered PA influences viewers' perceived emotional, mental, and physical states compared to imagery of natural scenery, offering insights into potential applications in mental health care and well-being. Overall, 102 participants age 18 to 35 years were randomly assigned to either the experimental group viewing 300 seconds of PA imagery (50/102, 49%) or the control group viewing 300 seconds of scenic imagery (52/102, 51%), after which every participant completed a survey that gathered qualitative data on the perceived impact of viewing their given imagery on their physical, mental, and emotional states through open-ended questions. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify the patterns of experiences reported by the participants. Qualitative analysis unveiled a greater intensity and diversity of emotional, mental, and physical impacts induced by PA compared to natural scenery, including the sense of relaxation and peace, anxiety and stress alleviation, joy, thrill and sense of euphoria, sensations of awe and wonder, hypnotizing effect, holistic meditative effect, provocation of creative thoughts, induced hyperawareness of bodily states, and transitions from induced overstimulation or anxious thoughts to feelings of calmness. The preliminary findings of this study suggest that PA is a rich and complex form of visual art that has the potential to facilitate healing and promote well-being and mental health. PA presents promising avenues for integration into mental health care, therapeutic practices, digital health, health care environment, and medical research.
