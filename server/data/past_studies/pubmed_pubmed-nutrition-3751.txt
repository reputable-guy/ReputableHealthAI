Study Title: Effects of Continuous Carbohydrate Intake with Gummies during the Golf Round on Interstitial Glucose, Golf Performance, and Cognitive Performance of Competitive Golfers: A Randomized Repeated-Measures Crossover Design.

Study Summary:
This study examined the effects of continuous carbohydrate intake during a golf round on interstitial glucose, golf performance, and the cognitive performance of competitive golfers. Eleven competitive golfers participated and played 18 holes of golf in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to the group indicated to consume the test food (CHO intake) or the group required to not consume it (NOT intake). Here, gummies were used as the test food, and the amount of carbohydrates was 30 g per h. Blood glucose levels were evaluated using interstitial glucose. Golf performance was measured in five tests, including scores, 2.5 m putting test, club head speed, driving distance, and accuracy. Cognitive performance was measured in three tests, including self-perceived levels of fatigue (PLF), self-perceived levels of concentration (PLC), and self-perceived levels of relaxation (PLR). Interstitial glucose (< 0.001) and PLF (< 0.001) were significantly reduced in the CHO intake compared with that in the NOT intake from the sixth hole. PLC was significantly higher in the CHO intake than in the NOT intake on all 18 holes (= 0.032). These findings suggest that continuous carbohydrate intake may be effective in reducing fatigue and maintaining the performance of competitive golfers.
