Study Title: Effects of monopolar pulsed-capacitive dielectric radiofrequency diathermy in patients with chronic low back pain: a randomised clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Monopolar capacitive diathermy is a physiotherapy technique that uses high-frequency currents to generate heat in deep tissues. This heat can have several therapeutic effects, especially in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP), however, until now there is little evidence of this type of diathermy. The purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of a pulsed monopolar dielectric radiofrequency diathermy (PRF)-capacitive type versus simulated treatment on symptomatology of patients with CLBP. A single-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted. Sixty patients with CLBP were randomly assigned to a PRF-capacitive or a simulated treatment group. All participants received 3 sessions per week for 3&#xa0;weeks. Disability, pain intensity, movement phobia, lumbar anteflexion, quality of life, and sleep quality were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at two months. The application of 9 sessions of PRF-capacitive showed significant improvements compared to simulated therapy during the entire follow-up for disability (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;26.99, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), pain intensity (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.550, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), the quality of life components of physical function (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.780, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), social function (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.780, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and mental health (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.858, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) and for sleep duration (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.863, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004).
