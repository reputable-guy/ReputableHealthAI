Study Title: Impact of varied feeding protocols on gastrointestinal function recovery in the early postoperative period following repeat cesarean section: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
With the adjustment of China's birth policy, the repeat cesarean sections raises concerns about potential gastrointestinal mechanical injuries and disturbances in gastrointestinal neurohormonal regulation, affecting the postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function. These affect maternal nutritional status, prolong recovery, extend hospitalization, increase medical costs, and lead to neonatal care challenges.This study is to examine the effects of different postoperative feeding protocols on the restoration of gastrointestinal function in women undergoing repeat cesarean section. A total of 103 women were randomly assigned to three groups: experimental group A (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;35), experimental group B (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34), and a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34). In group A, women without choking symptoms received a clear fluid diet postoperatively, followed by a pureed diet after 6&#xa0;h, and a regular soft diet after passing flatus. In group B, women chewed gum postoperatively, followed by a clear fluid diet after 2&#xa0;h, a pureed diet after 6&#xa0;h, and a regular soft diet after passing flatus. The control group received a clear fluid diet, a pureed diet after passing flatus, and a regular soft diet after defecation. Outcomes measured included recovery of gastrointestinal function, blood biochemical markers, comfort level, exclusive breastfeeding rate, and newborn weight loss. The baseline maternal data across the three groups demonstrated no significant differences (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Both experimental groups A and B showed earlier recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function compared to the control group, though there was no significant difference between the two experimental groups (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Additionally, postoperative comfort levels were significantly higher in both experimental groups than in the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Early feeding is safe and effective for women who underwent repeat cesarean sections.It has been shown to accelerate gastrointestinal recovery, significantly improve maternal comfort and satisfaction.In cases where immediate postoperative oral intake is not feasible, chewing gum demonstrates a comparable promotive effect, providing a viable substitute in facilitating recovery. This trial has been prospectively registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200065825) and the first registration date was 11/16/2022.
