Study Title: Effects of Magnesium Supplementation on Sleep Architecture

Study Summary:
A double-blind, randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of magnesium supplementation on sleep quality and architecture, with particular focus on deep sleep duration and overall sleep efficiency.

Methodology:

1. Study Design
Type: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
Duration: 12 weeks
Sample Size: 160 participants
Groups: Intervention (n=80) and Placebo (n=80)

2. Participant Characteristics
Demographics:
- Age range: 25-65 years
- Gender distribution: 55% female, 45% male
- Baseline sleep quality: PSQI scores > 5
- No diagnosed sleep disorders

Inclusion Criteria:
- Self-reported sleep issues
- Normal BMI range (18.5-29.9)
- No current magnesium supplementation
- Consistent sleep schedule

3. Intervention Protocol
Supplementation:
- Form: Magnesium glycinate
- Dosage: 400mg daily
- Timing: 1-2 hours before bedtime
- Duration: 12 weeks

Control:
- Matched placebo
- Identical appearance and packaging
- Same administration protocol

4. Measurements
Primary Outcomes:
- Deep sleep duration
- Total sleep time
- Sleep efficiency
- Sleep onset latency

Secondary Outcomes:
- Sleep architecture patterns
- Subjective sleep quality
- Daytime alertness
- Recovery metrics

5. Data Collection Methods
Objective Measures:
- Wearable sleep tracking devices
- Weekly blood magnesium levels
- Physical activity monitoring
- Heart rate variability

Subjective Measures:
- Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
- Sleep diary entries
- Epworth Sleepiness Scale
- Quality of life assessment

6. Results and Findings
Primary Outcomes:
- 23% increase in deep sleep duration
- 18% improvement in sleep efficiency
- 15% reduction in sleep onset latency
- 12% increase in total sleep time

Secondary Outcomes:
- Improved subjective sleep quality
- Enhanced recovery metrics
- Better daytime alertness
- Reduced sleep disturbances

7. Statistical Analysis
Methods Used:
- Mixed-effects model analysis
- Repeated measures ANOVA
- Multiple regression analysis
- Effect size calculations

Key Findings:
- Significant improvement in deep sleep (p<0.001)
- Large effect size for sleep efficiency (d=0.82)
- Moderate effect size for onset latency (d=0.65)
- Strong correlation with blood magnesium levels

8. Safety Monitoring
Adverse Events:
- Minor gastrointestinal effects (7%)
- Mild headaches (3%)
- No serious adverse events
- Good overall tolerability

Safety Measures:
- Weekly health check-ins
- Blood pressure monitoring
- Kidney function tests
- Electrolyte balance checks

9. Protocol Compliance
Adherence Rates:
- 92% supplement compliance
- 88% device wear time
- 95% questionnaire completion
- 90% follow-up rate

Quality Control:
- Daily compliance tracking
- Weekly data validation
- Monthly protocol reviews
- Regular calibration checks

10. Conclusions
Key Takeaways:
- Significant improvement in sleep quality
- Particular benefit for deep sleep
- Good safety profile
- High compliance rate

Recommendations:
- Consider magnesium for sleep quality
- Monitor blood levels
- Individual response variation
- Long-term safety confirmed

This study provides valuable insights into:
- Supplement efficacy measurement
- Sleep quality assessment methods
- Protocol implementation strategies
- Safety monitoring procedures
