Study Title: The whole-body and skeletal muscle metabolic response to 14&#x2009;days of highly controlled low energy availability in endurance-trained females.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the effects of 14&#x2009;days low energy availability (LEA) versus optimal energy availability (OEA) in endurance-trained females on substrate utilization, insulin sensitivity, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity; and the impact of metabolic changes on exercise performance. Twelve endurance-trained females (V&#x307;O55.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.1&#x2009;mL&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;min&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;kg) completed two 14-day randomized, blinded, cross-over, controlled dietary interventions: (1) OEA (51.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.0&#x2009;kcal&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;kg fat-free mass (FFM)&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;day) and (2) LEA (22.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;kcal&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;kg FFM&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;day), followed by 3&#x2009;days OEA. Participants maintained their exercise training volume during both interventions (approx. 8&#x2009;h&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;weekat 79% heart rate max). Skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity, glycogen, and maximal activity of CS, HAD, and PFK were unaltered with LEA. 20-min time trial endurance performance was impaired by 7.8% (&#x394; -16.8&#x2009;W, 95% CI: -23.3 to -10.4, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) which persisted following 3&#x2009;days refueling post-LEA (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). Fat utilization was increased post-LEA as evidenced by: (1) 99.4% (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) increase in resting plasma free fatty acids (FFA); (2) 270% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007) larger reduction in FFA in response to acute exercise; and (3) 28.2% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.015) increase in resting fat oxidation which persisted during submaximal exercise (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). These responses were reversed with 3&#x2009;days refueling. Daily glucose control (via CGM), HOMA-IR, HOMA-&#x3b2;, were unaffected by LEA. Skeletal muscle Outilization and carbohydrate availability were not limiting factors for aerobic exercise capacity and performance; therefore, whether LEA per se affects aspects of training quality/recovery requires investigation.
