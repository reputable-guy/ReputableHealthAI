Study Title: [Evaluation of a program led by community workers to promote cardiometabolic health in adults in a highly marginalized Mexican municipality].

Study Summary:
Objective: to evaluate the impact of a group program of nutrition education implemented by community workers on food consumption, physical activity and cardiometabolic risk. Material and methods: a randomized trial by conglomerates was performed. The intervention group (n = 246) participated in a program of nine group sessions of nutrition education delivered by community workers and focused on giving healthy habits options and evocation of motivations. The control group (n = 183) received printed information on healthy eating and physical activity. At the beginning of the study and after one year of follow-up, anthropometric measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, lipid profile and glucose were assessed. A questionnaire was applied to collect sociodemographic data, food consumption and physical activity. Results: in multilevel regression models it was observed that the intervention group reported an increase in the frequency of consumption of fruits, vegetables and legumes, increased body mass index and its probability of increasing recreational physical activity was higher; in addition, it reduced its consumption of sweetened cereals, and decreased the probability of hyperglycemia compared to the control group. Resting heart rate increased in both groups, but the increase was lower in the intervention group. Conclusions: nutrition education guided by community workers can have positive effects on cardiometabolic risk, so it would be an alternative to traditional education focused on providing information.
