Study Title: The role of experiential avoidance in the early stages of an online mindfulness-based intervention: Two mediation studies.

Study Summary:
There is evidence to suggest that only 2-4 weeks of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can already alleviate emotional stress. The current studies sought to examine whether experiential avoidance mediated the effects of MBIs on emotional distress during an early stage of the intervention.Chinese participants with high emotional distress were recruited. Study 1 included 324 participants, randomly assigned to an online MBI (=&#x2009;171) or a control group (=&#x2009;153). Experiential avoidance and general emotional distress were measured at baseline and after the 3rd week of the intervention. Study 2 included 158 participants, randomly assigned to an online MBI (=&#x2009;79) or a control group (=&#x2009;79). Experiential avoidance and emotional distress were measured at baseline and weekly in the first three weeks.Compared to the control group, experiential avoidance and emotional distress were significantly improved in the MBI group during the first three weeks of the intervention (Cohen's&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22-0.63). Moreover, changes in experiential avoidance mediated the effects of MBI on emotional distress in the early stage in both contemporary and lagged mediation models.Experiential avoidance is an important mediator during the early-stage of MBIs for alleviating emotional distress.
