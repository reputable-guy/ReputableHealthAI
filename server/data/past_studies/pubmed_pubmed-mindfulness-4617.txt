Study Title: A Randomized Pilot Study of Online Hatha Yoga for Physical and Psychological Symptoms Among Survivors of Allogenic Bone Marrow Transplant.

Study Summary:
Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is a curative procedure for patients with hematological malignancies, hemoglobinopathies, and errors of inborn metabolism. Survivors are not without symptom burden. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 12-week online yoga intervention compared to an educational control group in survivors of allogenic BMT. Participants were recruited nationally. Consenting participants were assigned to online yoga or a podcast control. Yoga and control group participants were instructed to complete 12 weeks of 60 minutes/week of online yoga and podcasts, respectively. Study participants were asked to complete online questionnaires at baseline (wk 0), midpoint (wk 6), postintervention (wk 12), and follow-up (wk 20). Feasibility benchmarks included > 70% satisfied with intervention and > 70% intending to continue participating in online yoga (acceptability); > 70% of participants achieving > 42 minutes/week of online yoga (demand); > 70% completing all four questionnaires (practicality); and at least small effect sizes of the intervention on Lee Symptom Score, physical function, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbance, social functioning, pain interference, depression, and quality of life as compared to control group (limited efficacy). Seventy-two participants consented and enrolled in the study (yoga group n = 33; podcast group n = 39). Of the yoga group participants, 54.5% (n = 19) completed the postintervention questionnaire, with 73.7% (n = 14) indicating they were satisfied/very satisfied and 15.8% (n = 3) likely/very likely to continue online yoga. Yoga participation averaged 31.98 minutes/week across 12 weeks. Both groups experienced a significant improvement in the Lee Symptom Score (6.2%-8.7% improvement from baseline) and depressive symptoms (5.3%-6.6% improvement from baseline). The yoga group experienced a significant reduction in pain (6.1% from baseline), and the podcast group experienced a significant reduction in fatigue (6.4% improvement from baseline). Online yoga was not found to be feasible to deliver to this population of survivors of BMT. However, there was satisfaction with online yoga among the majority of survivors of BMT, and beneficial effects were experienced in the yoga group on Lee Symptom Score, depressive symptoms, and pain. Future research is needed to enhance our understanding of barriers to online yoga participation for survivors of BMT and to determine its efficacy.
