Study Title: Randomized controlled trial of intravenous sedation vs general anesthesia for esophageal dilation with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in esophageal cancer patients.

Study Summary:
Esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is mostly diagnosed in its later stages, when patients present with dysphagia and weight loss. Esophageal dilation with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a common surgical procedure in patients with locally advanced ESCC because of tumor obstruction and enteral nutrition support during neoadjuvant or definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Esophageal dilation with PEG is widely performed under general anesthesia (GA) with endotracheal intubation. To determine the overall success rate of completing this procedure using intravenous (IV) sedation with dexmedetomidine (DEX) relative to GA and to compare its perioperative conditions, including procedure times, pain scores (visual analog scale), adverse events, and costs. Songklanagarind&#xa0;Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. Prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) of locally advanced ESCC patients who had dysphagia and needed esophageal dilation with PEG between January 2020 and December 2021. Esophageal dilation (using a Savary-Gilliard dilator) and PEG were performed using the pull technique. Seventy patients were randomly assigned to either the DEX group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34) or the GA group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36). All patients in both groups underwent successful surgery. The DEX group had a significantly shorter procedure time, lower procedure cost, and lower total hospital cost than the GA group. However, there were no significant between-group differences in pain scores or length of hospital stay. There were no serious adverse events in either group; however, the GA group had some incidences of sore throat, transient hoarseness, and atelectasis. This study found that IV sedation with DEX during esophageal dilation with PEG was as effective and safe as using GA.
