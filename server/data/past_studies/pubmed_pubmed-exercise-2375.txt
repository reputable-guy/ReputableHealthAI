Study Title: Vascular-endothelial adaptations following low and high volumes of high-intensity interval training in patients after myocardial infarction.

Study Summary:
Determinants of coronary artery disease, such as endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, could be attenuated by high-intensity aerobic interval exercise training (HIIT). However, the volume of this type of training is not well established. To assess the impact of two volumes of HIIT, low (LV-HIIT, <10&#x2009;min at high intensity) and high (HV-HIIT, >10&#x2009;min at high intensity), on vascular-endothelial function in individuals after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Clinical trial in 80&#x2009;AMI patients (58.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.3&#x2009;years, 82.5% men) with three study groups: LV-HIIT (&#x2009;=&#x2009;28) and HV-HIIT (&#x2009;=&#x2009;28) with two sessions per week for 16&#x2009;weeks and control group (CG,&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) with unsupervised physical activity recommendations. Endothelial function (brachial flow-mediated dilation, FMD), atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness ultrasound, cIMT), and levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) as a marker of oxidative stress were determined before and after the intervention period. After the intervention, in the exercise groups, there was an increase in FMD (LV-HIIT, &#x2191;58.8%; HV-HIIT, &#x2191;94.1%;&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) concurrently with a decrease in cIMT (LV-HIIT, &#x2193;3.0%; HV-HIIT, &#x2193;3.2%;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019) and LDLox (LV-HIIT, &#x2193;5.2%; HV-HIIT, &#x2193;8.9%;&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), with no significant changes in the CG. Furthermore, a significant inverse correlation was observed between ox-LDL and endothelial function related to the volume of HIIT training performed (LV-HIIT:&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.376,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031; HV-HIIT:&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.490,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.004), with no significance in the CG (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.924). In post-AMI patients, HIIT may lead to a volume-dependent enhancement in endothelial function, attributed to a decrease in oxidative stress, with added beneficial effects in reducing vascular wall thickness. An LV-HIIT program, with less than 10&#x2009;min at high intensity per session, has proven enough efficiency to initiate favorable vascular-endothelial adaptations, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk among patients with coronary artery disease.
