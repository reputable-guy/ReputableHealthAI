Study Title: The effect of oropharyngeal mother's milk on nutritional outcomes in preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Oropharyngeal interventions are an accepted method to improve the nutritional performance of premature infants. Considering the countless benefits of breast milk and the few studies on the use of breast milk as an oral-pharyngeal intervention, this study was conducted with the aim of determining the effect of oral-pharyngeal administration of breast milk on nutritional outcomes in premature infants. In this clinical trial, 80 premature infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of Amir al-Mu'minin Hospital in Semnan (a city in Iran) were randomly assigned to intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) and control groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40). Infants in the intervention group were given breast milk, and infants in the control group were given sterile water as a placebo. The data collection tool included demographic and clinical questions checklist, including sex, gestational age, weight, milk administration time, lavage and its amount, vomiting, abdominal distension, and so on. Data analysis was performed using SPSS23. The mean volume of total milk received by infants (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047) and the mean volume of milk received by mouth (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.000) at the time of discharge were higher in the intervention group. Moreover, the time to start enteral nutrition in the intervention group was lower than in the control group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012). Administering mother's milk through the oropharyngeal method led to a reduction in infants' length of stay in the hospital (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022). Based on the results of the present study, the oropharyngeal administration of breast milk in the first days after the birth of premature infants admitted to the hospital improves the outcomes related to their nutritional status. Therefore, it is suggested that this convenient, safe, and feasible method be used in hospitalized premature infants as soon as possible so that premature infants can benefit from the important advantages of breast milk.
