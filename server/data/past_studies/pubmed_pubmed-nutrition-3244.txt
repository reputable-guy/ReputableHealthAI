Study Title: Effect ofGene Polymorphism and Acute Caffeine Supplementation on Hormonal Response to Resistance Exercise: A Double-Blind, Crossover, Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Previous studies have reported that TT genotype carriers of the adenosine A2a receptor () gene rs5751876 polymorphism have better ergogenic and anti-inflammatory responses to caffeine intake compared to C allele carriers. The aim of the present study was twofold: (1) to investigate the association of thers5751876 polymorphism with acute caffeine supplementation on hormonal (growth hormone and testosterone) response to resistance exercise (RE); (2) to examine the relationship between the rs5751876 polymorphism and the resting levels of growth hormone and testosterone in athletes who are light caffeine consumers. A double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study involving 30 resistance-trained men (age 21.7 &#xb1; 4.1) was conducted to assess the impact of caffeine supplementation on serum growth hormone (GH) and testosterone (TS) levels before, immediately after, and 15 min post-RE. One hour before engaging in resistance exercise, subjects were randomly administered 6 mg of caffeine per kg of body mass or a placebo (maltodextrin). After a 7-day washout period, the same protocol was repeated. Resting testosterone and growth hormone levels were examined in the sera of 94 elite athletes (31 females, age 21.4 &#xb1; 2.8; 63 males, age 22.9 &#xb1; 3.8). Caffeine consumption led to significantly greater increases in GH and TS in men with the TT genotype compared to C allele carriers. Furthermore, in the group of athletes, carriers of the TT genotype had significantly higher testosterone (= 0.0125) and growth hormone (= 0.0365) levels compared to C allele carriers. In conclusion, thegene rs5751876 polymorphism may modify the effect of caffeine intake on the hormonal response to exercise.
