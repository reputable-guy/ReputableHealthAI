Study Title: Effect of Acute Nutritional Ketosis on Circulating Levels of Growth Differentiation Factor 15: Findings from a Cross-Over Randomised Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Exogenous supplementation with ketone beverages has been shown to reduce plasma glucose levels during acute nutritional ketosis. It remains to be investigated whether growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15)-an anorexigenic hormone-is involved in this process. The aim was to investigate the effect of a ketone ester beverage delivering &#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate (KE&#x3b2;HB) on plasma levels of GDF-15, as well as assess the influence of eating behaviour on it. The study was a randomised controlled trial (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03889210). Individuals were given a KE&#x3b2;HB beverage or placebo in a cross-over fashion. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min after ingestion. Eating behaviour was assessed using the three-factor eating questionnaire. GDF-15 levels were not significantly different (= 0.503) after the KE&#x3b2;HB beverage compared with the placebo. This finding remained consistent across the cognitive restraint, emotional eating, and uncontrolled eating domains. Changes in the anorexigenic hormone GDF-15, irrespective of eating behaviour, do not appear to play a major role in the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous ketones.
