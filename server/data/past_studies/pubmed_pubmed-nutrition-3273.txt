Study Title: A theoretical explanation for how a nutrition counseling and medically tailored meal delivery program benefitted participants living with lung cancer.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to assess participants' perceptions and experiences while participating in a Food is Medicine medically tailored meal plus intensive nutrition counseling intervention to create a theoretical explanation about how the intervention worked. This interpretive qualitative study included the use of semi-structured interviews with active participants in a randomized controlled trial aimed at understanding how a medically tailored meal plus nutrition counseling intervention worked for vulnerable individuals with lung cancer treated at four cancer centers across the USA. During the 8-month long study, participants in the intervention arm were asked to be interviewed, which were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using conventional content analysis with principles of grounded theory. Twenty individuals participated. Data analysis resulted in a theoretical explanation of the intervention's mechanism of action. The explanatory process includes three linked and propositional categories leading to patient resilience: engaging in treatment, adjusting to diagnosis, and active coping. The medically tailored meals plus nutrition counseling engaged participants throughout treatment, which helped participants adjust to their diagnosis, leading to active coping through intentional self-care, behavior change, and improved quality of life. These findings provide evidence that a Food is Medicine intervention may buffer some of the adversity related to the diagnosis of lung cancer and create a pathway for participants to experience post-traumatic growth, develop resilience, and change behaviors to actively cope with lung cancer. Medically tailored meals plus intensive nutrition counseling informed by motivational interviewing supported individuals' adjustment to their diagnosis and resulted in perceived positive behavior change.
