Study Title: Intermittent feeding with an overnight fast versus 24-h feeding in critically ill neonates, infants, and children: An open-label, single-centre, randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Critically ill children are fed day and night, assuming this improves enteral tolerance and the probability of achieving nutritional goals. It was previously shown that a fasting response, reflected by increased ketosis, at least partly explained the beneficial outcome of delayed initiation of supplemental parenteral nutrition. This study aims to investigate whether an overnight fast increases ketosis and is feasible and safe in critically ill children. The Continuousversus Intermittent Nutrition in Paediatric Intensive Care (ContInNuPIC) study is a randomised controlled trial in a tertiary referral Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in the Netherlands. Critically ill children (term newborn-18 years) with an expected PICU stay &#x2265;48&#xa0;h, dependent on artificial nutrition, were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified for age group) to intermittent feeding, with interruption of feedings during an age-dependent overnight period of eight to 12&#xa0;h, or to continuous feeding, with the administration of feedings day and night. In both groups, similar daily caloric targets were pursued. For children younger than one year, mandatory minor glucose infusions were provided during fasting. The primary outcome was the feasibility, defined as two conditions (1): a significant difference in the patients' highest daily ketone (3-&#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate, BHB) levels during each overnight period, and (2): non-inferiority regarding daily caloric intake, examined using a two-part mixed-effects model with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 33%, in an intention-to-treat analysis. The study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NL7877). Between May 19, 2020, and July 13, 2022, 140 critically ill children, median (first quartile; third quartile) age 0.3 (0.1; 2.7) years, were randomised to intermittent (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;67) or continuous feeding (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;73). In the intermittent feeding group, BHB levels were significantly higher (median 0.4 (0.2; 1.0) vs. 0.3 (0.1; 0.7) mmol/L, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). The ratio of total caloric intake in the intermittent feeding group to the intake in the continuous feeding group was not consistently significantly more than 0.67, thus not proving non-inferiority. No severe, resistant hypoglycaemic events, nor severe gastrointestinal complications related to the intervention occurred, and feeding intolerance did not occur more often in the intermittent than in the continuous feeding group. Compared with day and night feeding, intermittent feeding with an overnight fast and mandatory glucose infusion for children younger than one year marginally increased ketosis and did not lead to more hypoglycaemic incidents in critically ill children. Because non-inferiority regarding daily caloric intake was not proven, the feasibility of an overnight fast could not be shown in the current study. However, as feeding intolerance did not increase during the condensed feeding periods, the nutritional intake was probably limited by the prescription of nutrition and interruptions. More research is needed to determine the optimal level and duration of clinically relevant ketosis and the best method to achieve this.
