Study Title: Testing the Effectiveness of a Mindfulness- and Acceptance-Based Smartphone App for Nurses Traumatized by the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
A significant proportion of frontline nurses developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as a result of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a mindfulness- and acceptance-based smartphone app intervention among nurses traumatized by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. We randomly assigned 60 frontline nurses working in various clinical settings in the United States during the pandemic to either the intervention group (i.e. participants used the mindfulness app for 6 wk) or the wait-list control group. We assessed the app's efficacy through outcome measures of PTSD symptom severity, experiential avoidance, rumination, mindfulness, and resilience, measured at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention periods and a 1-month follow-up. Intervention satisfaction and perceived usability of the app were assessed within the intervention group. There was strong evidence of within-between interaction for PTSD, experiential avoidance, and rumination, implying significant improvement of these outcomes for the intervention group as compared to the control group. We only found a within-group interaction effect for mindfulness, indicating significant improvement of mindfulness within the intervention group only. Participants in the intervention group reported high satisfaction levels and perceived usability with the app. Findings highlight that mindfulness- and acceptance-based smartphone apps can improve PTSD symptoms of nurses traumatized by the pandemic. Healthcare organizations should provide nurses with accessible interventions (e.g. mindfulness apps) to treat and prevent secondary behavioral consequences of the pandemic, such as PTSD.
