Study Title: Mixed-Mode Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for psychological resilience, Self Esteem and Stigma of patients with schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
People with schizophrenia often face challenges such as lower psychological resilience, reduced self-worth, and increased social stigma, hindering their recovery. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has shown promise in boosting psychological resilience and self-esteem while diminishing stigma. However, MBCT demands professional involvement and substantial expenses, adding to the workload of professionals and the financial strain on patients. Mixed-mode Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (M-MBCT) integrates both "face-to-face" and "self-help" approaches to minimize staff effort and costs. This study aims to assess the impact of M-MBCT on the psychological resilience, self-esteem, and stigma in schizophrenia patients. This randomized, controlled, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial enrolled 174 inpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group underwent an 8-week M-MBCT intervention, while the control group received standard treatment. Data collection employed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI), and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) before and after the intervention. Post-intervention, significant differences in ISMI, CD-RISC, and RSES scores were observed between the experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, ISMI scores notably decreased, while CD-RISC and RSES scores significantly increased (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis identified age, education, and family history of mental illness as significant factors related to stigma (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Additionally, correlation analysis indicated a significant negative relationship between the reduction in CD-RISC scores and the reduction in ISMI scores (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). M-MBCT effectively enhanced psychological resilience and self-esteem while diminishing stigma in individuals with schizophrenia. M-MBCT emerges as a promising treatment option for schizophrenia sufferers. The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 03/06/2023 ( www.chictr.org.cn ; ChiCTR ID: ChiCTR2300069071).
