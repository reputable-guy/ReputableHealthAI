Study Title: Reduction in intake of discretionary foods and drinks among Danish schoolchildren: dietary results from the real-life cluster-randomised controlled trial 'Are You Too Sweet?'.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the multicomponent intervention trial 'Are You Too Sweet?' in reducing discretionary foods and drinks intake among young schoolchildren. The study was a 3&#xb7;5-month two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial among primary schoolchildren and their families. School health nurses provided guidance to families regarding discretionary foods and drinks for the children. Moreover, families were given a variety of knowledge- and capability-building materials to utilise at home. Dietary intake was assessed using a web-based 7-d dietary record. Linear mixed regression models were used to estimate intervention effects as changes in child intake of discretionary foods and drinks and sugar between groups. Six schools from a Danish municipality were randomised to the intervention group (4) or the control group (2). A total of 153 children aged 5-7 years. No significant reduction in the children's intake of total discretionary foods and drinks or discretionary foods alone was observed between the intervention and control group, while a decreased intake of discretionary drinks of 40&#xb7;9 % (= 0&#xb7;045) was observed compared with control. Secondary subgroup analysis showed that children of parents with shorter educational level significantly reduced their intake of added sugar by 2&#xb7;9 E% (= 0&#xb7;002). The results of this study indicate that multicomponent interventions involving school health nurses may have some effects in reducing, especially, discretionary drinks.
