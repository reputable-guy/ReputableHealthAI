Study Title: A randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled clinical trial of topical cryosim-1, a synthetic TRPM8 agonist, in prurigo nodularis.

Study Summary:
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is an intensively pruritic skin disease that negatively influences quality of life. Cryosim-1 (Intrinsic IB Spot) is a synthetic, selective transient receptor potential melastatin 8 agonist. To investigate the efficacy and safety of cryosim-1 in PN patients. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial including 30 patients was conducted. The numerical rating scale (NRS) of pruritus was evaluated before and 2&#x2009;h after cryosim-1 application at every visit. At week 8, the mean pruritus NRS before serum application (4.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4 treatment, 6.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5 placebo; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045) and 2&#x2009;h after serum application (2.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4 treatment, 4.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5 placebo; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031) were significantly lower in the treatment group, and the mean NRS for sleep disorder was significantly lower in the treatment group (2.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5 treatment, 4.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.8 placebo; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031). The mean satisfaction scales for pruritus improvement were significantly higher in the treatment group (7.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6) than in the placebo group (4.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.9; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). There was no difference in TEWL between the two groups, and no adverse reactions were reported. Cryosim-1 is a safe and effective topical treatment for PN patients.
