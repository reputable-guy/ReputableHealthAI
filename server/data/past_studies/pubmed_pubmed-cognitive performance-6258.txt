Study Title: Motor, cognitive, and combined rehabilitation approaches on MS patients' cognitive impairment.

Study Summary:
At the moment, the possible options for the management of cognitive dysfunctions in patients with MS (pMS) are pharmacological interventions, cognitive rehabilitation (CR), and physical exercise. However, worldwide, multimodal programs are infrequently applied in pMS and CR is not easily accessible through the National Health System as MR. The aim of the study is to explore if the combination of motor and cognitive rehabilitation may favor better outcomes on cognitive efficiency compared to separate trainings. Forty-eight pMS were submitted to detailed neuropsychological and motor assessments, before (T0) and after (T1) having performed one of three rehabilitation conditions (two cognitive trainings/week-Reha1; one cognitive and one motor training/week-Reha2; two motor trainings/week-Reha3, for 12&#xa0;weeks); they were randomly assigned to one condition or another. The CR was focused on memory functioning and performed with the Rehacom program. No significant differences in age, sex, education, and disease course were found between the three groups (sig.&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05). Reha1 patients increased only their cognitive performance, and Reha3 only increased their motor performance, while Reha2 increased both cognitive and motor performances. This benefit was also confirmed by the cognitive efficiency expressed by the Cognitive Impairment Index. These data confirm that to include cognitive training within rehabilitation programs may induce important benefits in pMS. Furthermore, pMS seem to benefit from a combined approach (cognitive and motor) more than from CR and motor rehabilitation separately (ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT05462678; 14 July 2022, retrospectively registered).
