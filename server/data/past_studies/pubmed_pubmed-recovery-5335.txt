Study Title: Effects of Serratus Anterior Plane Block on Early Recovery from Thoracoscopic Lung Resection: A Randomized, Blinded, Placebo-controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The efficacy of serratus anterior plane block for treatment of pain after minimally invasive thoracic surgery remains unclear. This trial assesses the impact of serratus anterior plane block on postoperative opioid consumption and on measures of early recovery after thoracoscopic lung resection. Patients undergoing minimally invasive anatomic lung resection at a single center were randomized to undergo serratus anterior plane block with 40&#x2009;ml injectate containing bupivacaine 0.25%, clonidine 100 &#x3bc;g, and dexamethasone 4&#x2009;mg (serratus anterior plane block group) or sham block with 40&#x2009;ml normal saline (placebo group) at the conclusion of surgery. The primary outcome was cumulative intravenous morphine equivalents during the first 24&#x2009;h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were intravenous morphine equivalents, pain scores at rest and with cough, inspiratory volume on incentive spirometry, incidence of nausea or vomiting during the first 48&#x2009;h postoperatively, Quality of Recovery-15 score on postoperative day 7, and length of stay. Using the protocol-specified intention-to-treat analysis, the median (interquartile range) intravenous morphine equivalents was 10.6 (5.0 to 27.1) mg in serratus anterior plane block patients (n = 46) versus 18.8 (9.9 to 29.6) mg in placebo patients (n = 46; 32% reduction; ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.06]; P = 0.085). Of the secondary outcomes, only the composite pain with cough scores differed significantly in the serratus anterior plane block group by a coefficient of -0.41 (95% CI, -0.81 to -0.01; P = 0.044). A sensitivity as-treated analysis reported median (interquartile range) intravenous morphine equivalents of 10.0 (5.0 to 27.2) mg in serratus anterior plane block patients (n = 44) versus 19.9 (10.4 to 29.0) mg in placebo patients (n = 48; 36% reduction; ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.00]; P = 0.048). The protocol-specified intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that serratus anterior plane block did not result in a significant reduction in opioid consumption when added to a multimodal analgesic regimen after thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection. The sensitivity as-treated analysis showed a significant and modest clinical reduction in the primary outcome that warrants further investigation.
