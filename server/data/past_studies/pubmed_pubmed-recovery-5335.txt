Study Title: Opioid-free anesthesia improves postoperative recovery quality of small and medium-sized surgery: a prospective, randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Opioid anesthesia (OA) is currently the predominant anesthetic method. However, its associated side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, coupled with the principle of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), have spurred the adoption of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) in select surgical procedures. For small and medium-sized operations, ERAS is particularly important. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of OFA, utilizing esketamine in combination with dexmedetomidine and sevoflurane, on postoperative recovery quality following small and medium-sized surgical interventions. A total of 120 patients who underwent various small and medium-sized operations were randomly allocated to OFA and OA groups. The OA group received sufentanyl and sevoflurane, while the OFA group received esketamine, dexmedetomidine, and sevoflurane. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative quality of recovery-40 scores (QoR-40) 24 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic changes at different time intervals, the incidences of adverse events were recorded. Patients in the OFA group exhibited a higher QoR-40 score of 184.0 (182.0, 186.2) compared to 182.0 (180.0, 184.0) in the OA group (P<0.001). The disparities were particularly noble in terms of Physical comfort and Emotional status. Multivariable analysis identified postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) as a significant independent factor impacting QoR-40 (&#x3b2;=-4.49 [-6.1, -2.87], P<0.001). Hemodynamic stability was more pronounced in the OFA than in the OA group. The incidence of PONV was substantially lower in the OFA group (one [1.6%] vs. 14 [25%], P<0.001), with a reduced need for vasoactive drugs (five [7.8%] vs. 15 [26.8%], P=0.005), and a lower incidence of respiratory depression (0 [0%] vs. six [10.7%], P=0.009). OFA improves the postoperative recovery quality in small and medium-sized surgical procedures, potentially attributed to decreased incidence of PONV. Additionally, OFA facilitates the maintenance of more stable hemodynamics throughout the operation.
