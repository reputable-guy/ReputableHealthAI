Study Title: Mindfulness and connection training during preservice teacher education reduces early career teacher attrition 4&#xa0;years later.

Study Summary:
Early career teacher attrition disrupts school continuity, precludes many of those who leave from achieving expertise, and drains economic resources from school systems. In a longitudinal cluster randomized controlled trial (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;8, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;98), we examined the impact of a 9-week meditation-based intervention on undergraduate preservice teachers' rates of attrition from teaching approximately 4&#xa0;years later. The odds of attrition among intervention group participants 3&#xa0;years into their teaching careers were significantly reduced by at least 77.0% regardless of modeling approach (Odds ratios&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.13-0.23, ps&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.013) compared to teacher education as usual controls. In benefit-cost analyses, we estimated that for every $1 spent on the intervention, hiring districts saved $3.43 in replacement teacher costs. Additional research is required to replicate the core finding of reduced attrition and understand the pathways through which the intervention caused these reductions.
