Study Title: Caring for a "Blue" Population: Addressing Priorities of the Officer Safety and Wellness Group in Nurse Practitioner Practice.

Study Summary:
Increased public concern over policing and the psychological impact of trauma-associated events by first responders have highlighted a critical need to improve the availability of mental health and wellness resources for law enforcement officers. The national Officer Safety and Wellness Group prioritized mental health, alcohol use, fatigue, and body weight/poor nutrition as targets for safety and wellness initiatives. Departmental culture will need to change from silence and fear-driven hesitancy to a culture of openness and support. Increased education, openness, and support for mental health will likely reduce stigma and improve access to care. Psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioners and other advanced practice nurses who wish to work with law enforcement officers should be aware of the specific health risks and standards of care that are summarized in this article.
