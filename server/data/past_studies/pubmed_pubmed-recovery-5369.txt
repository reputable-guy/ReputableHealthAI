Study Title: Differential effects of theta-gamma tACS on motor skill acquisition in young individuals and stroke survivors: A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study.

Study Summary:
Theta-gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) was recently found to enhance thumb acceleration in young, healthy participants, suggesting a potential role in facilitating motor skill acquisition. Given the relevance of motor skill acquisition in stroke rehabilitation, theta-gamma tACS may hold potential for treating stroke survivors. We aimed to examine the effects of theta-gamma tACS on motor skill acquisition in young, healthy participants and stroke survivors. In a pre-registered, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study, 78 young, healthy participants received either theta-gamma peak-coupled (TGP) tACS, theta-gamma trough-coupled (TGT) tACS or sham stimulation. 20 individuals with a chronic stroke received either TGP or sham. TACS was applied over motor cortical areas while participants performed an acceleration-dependent thumb movement task. Stroke survivors were characterized using standardized testing, with a subgroup receiving additional structural brain imaging. Neither TGP nor TGT tACS significantly modified general motor skill acquisition in the young, healthy cohort. In contrast, in the stroke cohort, TGP diminished motor skill acquisition compared to sham. Exploratory analyses revealed that, independent of general motor skill acquisition, healthy participants receiving TGP or TGT exhibited greater peak thumb acceleration than those receiving sham. Although theta-gamma tACS increased thumb acceleration in young, healthy participants, consistent with previous reports, it did not enhance overall motor skill acquisition in a more complex motor task. Furthermore, it even had detrimental effects on motor skill acquisition in stroke survivors.
