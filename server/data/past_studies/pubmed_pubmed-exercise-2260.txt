Study Title: Combining motivational and exercise intervention components to reverse pre-frailty and promote self-efficacy among community-dwelling pre-frail older adults: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Exercise is effective in preventing frailty status in older adults, but the effect of an exercise program based on Wellness Motivation Theory (WMT) on the frailty status, self-efficacy for exercise, and quality of life for older adults with pre-frailty remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the efficacy of a multicomponent exercise program based on WMT on frailty status, self-efficacy, and quality of life among pre-frail older adults. This was a randomized controlled trial of pre-frail older adults aged from 60 years to 85 years. Participants in the intervention group performed exercise three times a week for 24 weeks, once at a community health service station instructed by two researchers and two times at home. Participants in the control group were given one-time advice on physical activity. The assessor was the only one blinded. The primary outcome was the reversal rate of pre-frailty. The secondary outcomes included self-efficacy and quality of life. One hundred and forty-four participants were randomized into two groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;72 in the intervention group and n&#x2009;=&#x2009;72 in the control group) and analyzed. After 24 weeks, the proportion of pre-frailty was significantly lower in the intervention group than in control (31.8% versus 74.6%, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 42.8% [95% CI, 25.1-57.1]. In the 8th week and the 24th week, the frailty score of the intervention group was significantly lower than that of the control group. There were significant improvements in self-efficacy at week 2, week 8, and week 24. In weeks 8 and 24, participants in the intervention group reported a higher quality of life than the control group. There were no exercise-related injuries or falls among the participants. The exercise intervention based on WMT for pre-frail older adults could reverse pre-frailty, increase self-efficacy for exercise, and improve the quality of life in older Chinese.
