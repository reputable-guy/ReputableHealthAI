Study Title: Evaluation of Splint and Exercise Interventions for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Insights from Ultrasonographic Measurements.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a neuropathy caused by the entrapment of the median nerve, which requires effective management strategies. The median nerve is subjected to pressure within the carpal tunnel, resulting in tingling, numbness, and pain in the median side of the hand. We compared the efficacy of splint use with an exercise program vs exercise alone in patients with mild and moderate CTS. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-four patients with CTS were enrolled. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: splint+exercise and exercise only. A range of assessment tools were used, including ultrasonography, dynamometer, the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms &amp; Signs Pain Score (LANSS), Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Q-DASH) score, and 36-Item Short Form Quality of Life Scale (SF-36) score, to provide comprehensive evaluation. RESULTS The 2 groups had comparable outcomes at the end of treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in Q-DASH (P=0.326, Cohen's d=0.067), SF-36 (P=0.329, Cohen's d=0.218), VAS (P=0.521, Cohen's d=-0.299), or LANSS scores (P=0.627, Cohen's d=0.039) between the groups (P>0.05). The results demonstrate that a targeted exercise regimen, when used in isolation, can elicit outcomes that are comparable to those achieved through the integration of splinting techniques. CONCLUSIONS The study findings align with conflicting existing data on the effectiveness of splint immobilization in conjunction with exercises for CTS. The results support the significance of regular exercises, which can be applied in the home-based setting in CTS management, and offer alternative online management strategies.
