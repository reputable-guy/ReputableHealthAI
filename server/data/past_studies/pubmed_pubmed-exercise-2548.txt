Study Title: Improving management in gastroesophageal reflux disease through leveraging WeChat platform for mobile health care: A randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to a clinical condition characterized by gastric content reflux into the esophagus, causing symptoms like acid regurgitation and heartburn. While patient education is essential for GERD treatment, traditional educational models often struggle to effectively improve treatment outcomes. Between January 2021 and April 2022, we enrolled 257 patients and assessed their GERD knowledge. The patients were randomly assigned to either the WeChat group (60 participants) for health education via WeChat platform or the control group (60 participants) for conventional education only. GERD-Q scores were collected at 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention, with compliance and satisfaction assessed at the study's conclusion. The overall awareness rate of GERD among patients was approximately 22.3 %. The WeChat group showed better compliance than the control group in terms of adhering to a proper diet, taking medication on time, and engaging in moderate exercise (P < 0.05 for all). Furthermore, the WeChat group demonstrated significantly higher treatment effectiveness and satisfaction than the control group (P < 0.05 for all). Patients have a relatively low level of knowledge regarding GERD. WeChat has the potential to facilitate lifestyle changes and improve compliance, treatment effectiveness, and treatment satisfaction among patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
