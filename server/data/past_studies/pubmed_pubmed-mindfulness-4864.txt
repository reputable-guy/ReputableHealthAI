Study Title: The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Sex Therapy on Improving Sexual Desire Disorder, Sexual Distress, Sexual Self-Disclosure and Sexual Function in Women: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Sexual desire disorder is the most common form of sexual dysfunction among women and is associated with problems like sexual distress and reduced sexual self-disclosure. As a result, this RCT study was conducted with 70 reproductive-age women in the form of 4 weekly group educational sessions. Compared to the control group, the mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral sex therapy (MBCST) intervention significantly improved sexual -desire, -distress, self-disclosure and -function immediately, 4 and 12 weeks after the educational sessions were completed in the intervention group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Overall, our findings underscore the significance of the MBCST intervention on improving sexual dysfunction among women.Trial registration number: Iranian registry of clinical trials.
