Study Title: Vitamin D supplementation has no effect on cognitive performance after four months in mid-aged and older subjects.

Study Summary:
Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with impaired cognitive function, but the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function is uncertain. 422 subjects were included in a randomized controlled trial with vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 100,000&#x202f;IU given as a bolus dose followed by 20,000&#x202f;IU per week versus placebo for four months. Cognitive function was evaluated with verbal recall test, coding test and tapping test. 374 subjects (mean age 52&#x202f;years, 198 males) had complete cognitive tests both at baseline and at end of study. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 34&#x202f;nmol/L. At baseline there were no significant associations between serum 25(OH)D and the three separate cognitive tests. At the end of the study mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 89&#x202f;nmol/L and 31&#x202f;nmol/L in the vitamin D and placebo groups, respectively. At the end of the study, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding change in the cognitive test scores. Nor did sub-group analyses based on gender, age, baseline serum 25(OH)D and cognitive test scores reveal significant differences between the two groups at the end of the study. Vitamin D supplementation did not improve cognitive function during a four months intervention in mid-aged and older subjects. ClinicalTrials.govNCT02750293.
