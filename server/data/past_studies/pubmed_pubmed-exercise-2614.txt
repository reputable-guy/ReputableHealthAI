Study Title: The effect of formative assessment on students' clinical knowledge, skills and self-efficacy levels.

Study Summary:
This research aims to examine the effect of using formative assessment methods in clinical education on students' knowledge, skills and self-efficacy levels. Formative assessment is used as a method designed to identify areas where students fall short and provide feedback for improvement. Formative assessment and feedback represent fundamental characteristics of quality teaching in higher education and play a decisive role in learning in nursing education. Although educators observe students performing practical tasks during clinical education, evaluation is not made by a structured control list. Therefore, just as nursing students are evaluated with "Skill Checklists" in the OSCE exam, there is a need to evaluate nursing skills during patient care in the clinical field. The study was designed as a pre-test post-test randomized controlled experimental study. Before the research, both groups filled out the self-efficacy form. The experimental group received formative assessment throughout the course. At the end of the semester, all students were given a skills test and asked to fill out the self-efficacy form again. Finally, a knowledge test was administered to the entire class. The average knowledge score of the experimental group is higher than the control group. It was determined that there was a statistical difference of 16.54 points in the average skill scores between the groups. Posttests showed significant differences in skills such as breathing-cough exercise, basic glycemic measurement, subcutaneous injection and blood collection skills. It was determined that the formative assessment method increased nursing students' knowledge, skills and self-efficacy levels regarding basic nursing skills.
