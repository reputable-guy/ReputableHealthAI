Study Title: Treatment Satisfaction With Omnipod DASH in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: A Nonblinded 1:1 Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Omnipod DASH Insulin Management System is a tubeless insulin pump that overcomes the physical inconveniences of conventional tubed insulin pump therapy (IPT). We compared treatment satisfaction with Omnipod DASH System to usual care (multiple daily injections [MDIs] or tubed IPT) in adults with type 1 diabetes using self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG). Adults with type 1 diabetes on MDI (n = 40) or IPT (n = 25) from 4 diabetes centers in Australia were randomly assigned in a 1:1 nonblinded manner to Omnipod DASH System (Omnipod group) or continue usual care (Usual Care group) for 12 weeks, followed by a further 12-week extension during which all participants used the device. The primary outcome was treatment satisfaction assessed by change in Diabetes Technology Questionnaire "current" (&#x394;DTQ-current) score at 12 weeks (study end). Secondary outcomes included &#x394;DTQ-current following extension and other participant-reported outcomes (PROs) measuring quality of life, burden of disease treatment, and glycemic and device-related outcomes at 12 weeks (study end) and 24 weeks (end extension). Treatment satisfaction improved more in the Omnipod group vs the Usual Care group (&#x394;DTQ-current score of 16.4 [21.2] vs 0.0 [12.8]; P < .001) at study end. Significantly greater improvements in other PROs and glycated hemoglobin A1c were also observed. Improvements in DTQ-current and other PROs comparing study end and end extension were similar. While percentage in time in range change from baseline did not differ at study end (-2.0 [12.7] %), it was significantly greater at end extension (5.6 [10.9] %; P = .016). The Omnipod DASH System resulted in greater treatment satisfaction at 12 weeks in adults with type 1 diabetes using SMBG that was sustained after 24 weeks of device use without compromising sleep quality and fear of hypoglycemia. Improvements in glycemia were also observed.
