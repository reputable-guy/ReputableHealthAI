Study Title: How enteral nutrition modes influence nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors with late dysphagia after radiotherapy: a randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Palliation to late dysphagia after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) continues to be a challenge. Intermittent oro-esophageal tube feeding (IOE) is an emerging enteral nutrition mode that can address nutrition and quality of life issues related to nasogastric tube feeding (NGT). This study aims to investigate the effect of IOE versus NGT in late dysphagia after radiotherapy for NPC. This randomized controlled study included 82 NPC survivors with late dysphagia after radiotherapy. The subjects were randomized divided into the IOE and NGT groups (n1&#x2009;=&#x2009;n2&#x2009;=&#x2009;41). Both groups received standard-of-care rehabilitation. Enteral nutrition supports were administered through IOE or NGT accordingly. This study lasted 2&#xa0;weeks for each participant. The primary outcome was nutritional status including albumin, hemoglobin, total serum protein, and body mass index. The secondary outcomes were (i) the functional oral intake scale (FOIS), (ii) the penetration-aspiration scale (PAS), (iii) oral transit time (OTT), (iv) hyoid pause time (HPT), (v) pharyngeal transport time (PTT), and (vi) swallowing-quality of life (SWAL-QoL). Three cases quitted the study halfway and there were no significant baseline differences between the IOE (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) and NGT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;39) groups. Both time and group effects were significant in all nutritional indicators. The time effect was significant in the FOIS levels, OTT and PTT, while the group effect was not. Either time or group effect were insignificant in the PAS levels and HPT. Both group and time effects were significant in the SWAL-QoL total scores (z&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.080, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; z&#x2009;=&#x2009;18.005, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The significance of time and group effects varied across different dimensions of the SWAL-QoL. Rehabilitation interventions can improve swallowing function among NPC survivors with late dysphagia after radiotherapy. In this population who received standard-of-care rehabilitation, IOE is more conducive to the improvement of nutritional status, and swallowing-related quality of life.
