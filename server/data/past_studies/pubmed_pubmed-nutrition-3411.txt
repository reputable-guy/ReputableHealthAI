Study Title: Comparison of Growth Outcomes Between Human Milk-Fed Preterm Infants on Standard Versus Adjustable Fortification Protocols.

Study Summary:
Human milk (HM) is usually fortified using standard fortification (STD) to improve nutrition of preterm infants. However, the protein component may still be insufficient. HM could be further fortified with additional protein to improve STD.The primary objective was to compare changes in body weight (g/day, g/kg/day), length, and head circumference (mm/day) between preterm neonates fed HM with STD and those fed HM with adjustable fortification (ADJ).This study was a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled study in preterm infants of gestational age <32 weeks and weighing &#x2264;1,800 g, admitted to the neonatal unit of the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health. Once the infants received full HM feed with STD at 24 kcal/oz, they were randomized to either continue with STD or with ADJ group by adding additional protein to the STD and making further protein adjustments based on the blood urea nitrogen levels.Thirty preterm infants completed the study and were randomized into two groups of 15 each. The baseline characteristics, total fluid, and energy intake were similar. Compared with the STD group, infants in the ADJ group exhibited significantly greater weight gain (36.46&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.09 vs. 25.78&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.81 g/day;= 0.001) and greater length gain (1.93&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.57 vs. 1.12&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.64 mm/day;= 0.001). Protein intake significantly correlated with both weight (= 0.632,< 0.001) and length gain (= 0.577,= 0.001); however, no correlation was found between energy intake, volume intake, and growth outcomes.Preterm infants fed with ADJ had significantly higher weight and length gains than those fed with STD, suggesting that additional protein intake may play an important role in growth.
