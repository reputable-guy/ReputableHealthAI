Study Title: Creatine Supplementation Prior to Strength Exercise Training Is Not Superior in Preventing Muscle Mass Loss Compared with Standard Nutritional Recommendations in Females After Bariatric Surgery: A Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
This study examines whether creatine supplementation combined with strength training mitigates muscle mass loss in women during early rehabilitation post-bariatric surgery, as its effectiveness remains untested in this context. Fifteen women (37.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.6 years; BMI, 38.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.6 kg/m) completed the intervention (creatine group&#x2009;=&#x2009;7; placebo group&#x2009;=&#x2009;8). Both groups followed a strength training program three times a week for 8 weeks. The dosage for both the creatine and placebo was 8 g prior to each exercise session. Body weight, skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, handgrip strength, and physical activity levels were measured before and after the intervention. The creatine group showed a reduction of 9.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5 kg in body weight, with a 0.72&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6 kg decrease in muscle mass and an 8.64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.2 kg reduction in fat mass. The placebo group had a reduction of 9.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.5 kg in body weight, with a 0.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.2 kg decrease in muscle mass and an 8.88&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.2 kg reduction in fat mass, without significant differences between groups (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The pre-session strength exercise training creatine supplementation is not superior to placebo regarding body weight and fat mass losses and the attenuation of muscle mass loss during the first weeks of rehabilitation following bariatric surgery.
