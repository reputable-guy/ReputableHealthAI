Study Title: Effects of Acute Citrulline Malate Supplementation on CrossFitExercise Performance: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Cross-Over Study.

Study Summary:
Given the increasing popularity of CrossFitas a high-intensity functional training program and the potential benefits of citrulline malate (CM) in enhancing exercise performance through its role as a precursor to L-arginine and nitric oxide production, this study aimed to investigate the acute effects of CM supplementation on CrossFitperformance and cardiovascular function. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 21 recreationally active participants (mean age 22.2 &#xb1; 2.6 years, mean body weight 75.9 &#xb1; 10.4 kg) with CrossFitexperience completed the "Cindy" workout under CM and placebo conditions. Participants consumed 4.4 g of CM or a placebo 60 min before the workout, and the performance was measured by the number of rounds completed. Secondary outcomes included heart rate response, time spent in different heart rate intensity zones, and post-exercise recovery time. The results indicated no significant difference in the number of rounds completed between the CM and placebo conditions (13.5 &#xb1; 5.2 vs. 13.8 &#xb1; 6.7 rounds, respectively;= 0.587). However, the time spent in zone 4 (80-90% of HR max) was significantly increased in the CM condition (527 &#xb1; 395 s vs. 453 &#xb1; 334 s;= 0.017), suggesting a potential benefit for aerobic capacity and anaerobic threshold. No significant differences in post-exercise recovery time were observed (6.6 &#xb1; 4.7 h vs. 6.9 &#xb1; 4.7 h;= 0.475). This study highlights the need for further research with larger sample sizes, both genders, and different CM dosages to clarify these findings and better understand CM's role in enhancing athletic performance.
