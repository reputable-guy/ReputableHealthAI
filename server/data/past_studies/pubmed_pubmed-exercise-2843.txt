Study Title: Effectiveness of McKenzie exercises plus stabilization exercises versus McKenzie exercises alone on disability, pain, and range of motion in patients with nonspecific chronic neck pain: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Chronic nonspecific neck pain is a common disorder that causes disability and reduced quality of life. Effective conservative treatment options are needed to manage this condition. This randomized trial compared the efficacy of McKenzie exercises alone versus McKenzie plus cervical and scapulothoracic stabilization training for patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in an outpatient physical therapy clinic. 76 patients with chronic (> 3 months) neck pain were randomized to 6 weeks of either McKenzie exercises alone (n= 38) or McKenzie plus stabilization exercise (n= 38). The McKenzie protocol included posture correction, range of motion exercises, and lateral neck stretches. The stabilization program added targeted exercises for the neck and scapula. The combination of McKenzie plus stabilization exercises resulted in significantly greater reduction in current neck pain intensity compared to McKenzie alone at 6 weeks (mean difference: -1.2 points on 0-10 scale, 95% CI -1.8 to -0.6; p< 0.001). Neck disability improved in both groups. Cervical range of motion also improved more with the addition of stabilization, except for extension. Adding specific cervical and scapulothoracic stabilization exercises to a standard McKenzie protocol led to clinically meaningful reductions in neck pain compared to McKenzie therapy alone in patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain. This combined approach can improve outcomes.
