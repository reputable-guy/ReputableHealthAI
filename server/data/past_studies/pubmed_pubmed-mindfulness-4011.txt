Study Title: Effect of applying mindfulness-based relapse prevention nursing program on readiness for change and self-efficacy among clients with substance use disorders: A randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
Investigate the effect of applying mindfulness-based relapse prevention on readiness for change and self-efficacy among patients with substance use disorders. A randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms was conducted among 100 male inpatients with substance use disorders, equally divided into a study group and a control group (50 clients in each). Tools included the Five Factors Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale, and the Drug Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale. The study group exhibited significant and immediate improvement in mindfulness post-intervention, with a large effect size sustained to one month. The intervention markedly enhanced mindfulness significantly more than the control group. The study group demonstrated a significant increase in readiness for change and an immediate significant reduction in temptation-related self-efficacy. In addition, there was a significant increase in confidence-related self-efficacy among the study group, more than in the control group. The improvement of the five factors of mindfulness following participation in mindfulness-based relapse Prevention was associated with enhanced readiness for change and self-efficacy among patients with substance use disorders in the study group, in contrast to minimum improvement in the control group. Our findings suggest that psychiatric nurses can effectively integrate mindfulness-based Relapse Prevention into treatment protocols for substance use disorders, thereby enhancing patient outcomes. Their responsibilities include facilitating mindfulness-based relapse prevention sessions, a practice that can empower patients with valuable skills to navigate the challenges of recovery and maintain abstinence.
