Study Title: Self-administered mindfulness interventions reduce stress in a large, randomized controlled multi-site study.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness witnessed a substantial popularity surge in the past decade, especially as digitally self-administered interventions became available at relatively low costs. Yet, it is uncertain whether they effectively help reduce stress. In a preregistered (OSF https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UF4JZ ; retrospective registration at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06308744 ) multi-site study (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2,239, 70.4% women, M&#x2009;=&#x2009;22.4, s.d.&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.1, all fluent English speakers), we experimentally tested whether four single, standalone mindfulness exercises effectively reduced stress, using Bayesian mixed-effects models. All exercises proved to be more efficacious than the active control. We observed a mean difference of 0.27 (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.56; 95% confidence interval, -0.43 to -0.69) between the control condition (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.95, s.d.&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.50) and the condition with the largest stress reduction (body scan: M&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.68, s.d.&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46). Our findings suggest that mindfulness may be beneficial for reducing self-reported short-term stress for English speakers from higher-income countries.
