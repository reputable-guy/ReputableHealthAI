Study Title: Metataxonomic analysis of endophytic bacteria of blackberry (Rubus ulmifolius Schott) across tissues and environmental conditions.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: Endophytic bacteria represent an important component of plant wellness. They have been widely studied for their involvement in plant development and enhancement of stress tolerance. In this work, the endophytic communities of roots, stems, and leaves of blackberry (Rubus ulmifolius Schott) were studied in three different niches: natural, riverside, and human-impacted niches. (2) Results: The microbiome composition revealed that Sphingomonadaceae was the most abundant family in all samples, accounting for 9.4-45.8%. In contrast, other families seem to be linked to a specific tissue or niche. Families Microbacteriaceae and Hymenobacteraceae increased their presence in stem and leaf samples, while Burkholderiaceae abundance was important in riverside samples. Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed that root samples were the most diverse, and they gathered together in the same cluster, apart from the rest of the samples. (3) Conclusions: The analysis of the microbiome of R. ulmifolius plants revealed that the composition was essentially the same in different niches; the differences were primarily influenced by plant tissue factors with a core genome dominated by Sphingomonadaceae. Additionally, it was observed that R. ulmifolius can select its own microbiome, and this remains constant in all tissues evaluated regardless the niche of sampling.
