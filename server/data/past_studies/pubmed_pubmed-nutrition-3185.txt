Study Title: Effect of an intensive nutrition intervention of a high protein and low glycemic load diet on weight of kidney transplant recipients: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a high protein and low glycemic load diet in preventing weight gain after kidney transplantation. We designed a prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled study to compare the efficacy of a high protein (1.3-1.4&#x2009;g/kg/day) and low glycemic load diet versus a conventional diet (0.8-1.0&#x2009;g/kg/day of protein and no recommendations on glycemic load) in preventing weight gain (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02883777). A total of 120 patients were evaluated. Patients were followed for 12 months, and the primary outcome was weight maintenance or weight gain lower than 5%. There were no differences in total energy intake, carbohydrates, and total fats between groups. Intervention group (IG) increased protein intake to 1.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.56&#x2009;g/kg/day and decreased the glycemic load to 87.27&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.54&#x2009;g/day, while control group (CG) had a dietary protein intake of 1.19&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.43&#x2009;g/kg/day and a glycemic load of 115.60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.01&#x2009;g/day. Total fiber intake was greater and trans-fat was lower in IG. Dietetic cholesterol increased in IG over time and was significantly different between groups. Overall, patients had an increase in body weight over time, with a mean increment of 4.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.5&#x2009;kg (5.75%). The percentage of patients who achieved the primary outcome was 50% of sample size, without differences between groups. The glomerular filtration rate improved over time in both groups. Considering 24-h proteinuria and albuminuria, a similar rise was observed in both groups. The present dietary intervention was safe, but had no effect on weight gain in kidney transplant subjects. Our findings suggest that other strategies, including alternative dietary and/or pharmacological and psychological interventions might be tested in randomized control trials in order to improve patients' body weight outcomes after transplant.
