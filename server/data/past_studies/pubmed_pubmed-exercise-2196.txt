Study Title: No effect of grape juice on exercise-induced muscle damage or performance in male runners: a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to verify the effect of grape juice () intake on exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) and exercise performance parameters (5 km running time-trial (TT), running economy, and countermovement jump (CMJ)). Twenty trained male runners were randomized into two blinded groups and consumed either placebo (&#xa0;=&#xa0;9) or grape juice (&#xa0;=&#xa0;11) for six consecutive days (600&#x2009;mL/day). On the fourth day, the participants performed a downhill running (-15%) at speed that elicited 70% V&#x307;Omax for 20&#x2009;min, to induce muscle damage, followed by assessment of running economy, 5&#x2009;km TT, and CMJ tests. Blood samples were obtained before and after the exercise tests for quantifying total phenols, creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). On the sixth day, blood parameters and CMJ were evaluated. A two-way Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) mixed model was employed for data analysis, the effects were the juice groups, measurement and a interaction between the factors. EIMD was confirmed by increased levels of indirect markers (serum AST and LDH activities) and an impairment in TT and CMJ performances after 48&#x2009;h. The 5&#x2009;km TT, economy, and CMJ were compromised after EIMD, to a similar extent in the groups. Blood concentrations of CK, LDH, AST, and total phenolic compounds presented similar time course behavior between the groups, showing no group&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;time interaction effects. In conclusion, grape juice consumption over 6 days did not attenuate EIMD markers or the impairment in running performance in trained male runners. (ReBEC number: RBR-9jkkvbb).
