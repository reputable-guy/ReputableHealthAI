Study Title: A novel prolonged exposure therapy protocol for improving therapy session attendance and PTSD symptoms among adults receiving buprenorphine or methadone treatment.

Study Summary:
Among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is higher than in the general population. Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy is highly efficacious for improving PTSD symptoms. However, few studies have evaluated PE in individuals receiving medications for OUD (MOUD) and treatment completion rates have been low. This randomized trial evaluated the efficacy of a novel protocol for improving PE attendance and PTSD symptoms among adults receiving buprenorphine or methadone treatment. Eligible participants (n=52) were randomized to one of three 12-week experimental conditions: (a) continued MOUD treatment as usual (TAU; n=17), (b) Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE; n=17), or (c) PE with financial incentives contingent upon PE session attendance (PE+; n=18). Primary outcomes included percent of PE sessions attended and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). PE+ participants attended significantly more therapy sessions than PE participants (88&#x2009;% vs 33&#x2009;%; p<.001). All three groups reported significant (p<.05) improvements in CAPS-5 scores between intake and week 12, with no significant group differences. However, PE+ participants achieved significantly greater improvements in self-reported PTSD symptoms (p=.02) than TAU participants, as well as higher rates of diagnostic remission compared to TAU and PE participants (p<.001). Participants in the two PE groups did not exhibit an increase in non-prescribed drug use. In this study of adults receiving MOUD treatment, PE+ was efficacious for increasing PE attendance. Our findings also provide promising support for the efficacy of PE+ for improving PTSD symptoms without exacerbating substance use. NCT04104022.
