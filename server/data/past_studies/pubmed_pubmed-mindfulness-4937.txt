Study Title: A qualitative comparison of mindfulness meditation, cognitive therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for chronic low back pain.

Study Summary:
This study reports a qualitative analysis of patient experiences following cognitive therapy (CT), mindfulness meditation (MM), or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for chronic low back pain (CLBP). It aimed to investigate the procedural elements reported by participants as important across these approaches, as well as the role of treatment-related change processes and common factors. Research Method/Design: A qualitative analysis of posttreatment semistructured interviews was conducted with participants who enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing MM, CT, and MBCT (N = 57 adults with CLBP). A thematic analysis of transcribed interviews was undertaken by two independent coders; emerging themes, subthemes, and direct quotes were collated, and thematic maps were created. Procedural elements that were both unique (e.g., "cognitive restructuring" in CT) and shared among the three treatments (e.g., "knowledge gained" on pain-related topics) were reported as important. Each treatment was associated with a small number of unique therapeutic processes that were consistent with theoretical tenets underlying the interventions (e.g., "staying in the present moment" in MM). A large number of shared processes and common factors also emerged as important across all three treatments. These first-person accounts provide insight into those participant-identified therapeutic procedures and change processes that were most valued by individuals completing cognitive and mindfulness-based interventions for CLBP. Early identification of treatment barriers and strategies to overcome these barriers is necessary. Further, therapeutic rapport and training participants in coping skills they themselves can use were critical, as was engendering changes in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral mechanisms.
