Study Title: Effectiveness and safety of motion-style acupuncture treatment using traction for inpatients with acute low back pain caused by a traffic accident: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as neck pain and low back pain (LBP) are common after a traffic accident (TA). While motion-style acupuncture treatment (MSAT) is effective in relieving pain, MSAT using traction (T-MSAT) has rarely been studied, and evidence for its efficacy and safety is lacking. To address this gap, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of T-MSAT for pain and functional disturbances in patients with acute LBP caused by a TA. This two-armed, parallel, assessor blinded randomized controlled trial, conducted at Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine, included 100 patients with acute LBP occurring within 1 week of a TA. The participants were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either combined T-MSAT and integrative Korean medicine treatment (IKMT) or only conventional IKMT, applied for 3 consecutive days after admission. The primary outcome was the difference between numerical rating scale (NRS) scores for LBP at baseline and after treatment completion on day 4 after admission. At the primary endpoint, the difference in NRS scores for LBP between the T-MSAT and control groups was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-1.48). The T-MSAT group showed a significantly lower NRS score for LBP than the control group. Differences in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores between the T-MSAT and control groups were significant at baseline and discharge. The area under the curve of the VAS score showed a significant difference (-46.86 [95% CI -85.13 to -8.59]), indicating faster pain reduction in the T-MSAT group than in the control group. Recovery (30% pain reduction) was achieved more rapidly in the T-MSAT group than in the control group (log-rank test P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.005). Meanwhile, the NRS, VAS, Oswestry disability index, and quality of life scores at discharge or at the 12-week follow-up showed no significant difference. The rates of mild adverse events (AEs) were comparable between the groups. No severe AEs were reported, and none of the AEs were associated with the clinical trial. T-MSAT combined with IKMT is a safe treatment that can effectively and quickly reduce initial pain in patients with LBP.
