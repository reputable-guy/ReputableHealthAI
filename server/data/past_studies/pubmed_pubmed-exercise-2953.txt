Study Title: The effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on cognitive function in individuals with stroke-induced mild cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled pilot study.

Study Summary:
To assess the impact of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on working memory in stroke-induced mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Randomized, double-blind controlled study. Twenty MCI patients from the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (December 2021 to February 2023), aged 34-79, 2-12 months post-stroke, were divided into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG), each with 10 participants. The EG underwent standard rehabilitation plus 40 minutes of aerobic exercise, while the CG received only standard therapy, 5 times weekly for 2 weeks. Working memory was tested using the n-back task, and overall cognitive function was measured with the MOCA and MMSE Scales before and after the intervention. The EG showed higher 3-back correctness (71.80&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14.53 vs 56.50&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13.66), MOCA scores (27.30&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.57 vs 24.00&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.13), and improved visuospatial/executive (4.60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.52 vs 3.30&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.06) and delayed recall (4.30&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.82 vs 3.00&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.56) on the MOCA scale compared with the CG. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise may enhance working memory, visuospatial/executive, and delayed recall functions in stroke-induced MCI patients.
