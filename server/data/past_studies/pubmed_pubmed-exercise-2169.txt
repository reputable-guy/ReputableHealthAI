Study Title: Comparison of Pressure Feedback Biofeedback Training with Conventional Lumbar Dynamic Strength Exercises for Chronic Low Back Pain: A Prospective Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
Different exercise regimens have been used to manage chronic low back pain (CLBP) but it is unclear which system is most effective. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of stabilization with pressure feedback biofeedback training and conventional lumbar dynamic strength exercises on pain level, functionality, fear avoidance beliefs, and quality of life in patients with CLBP. The study was a randomized, controlled trial. The study was conducted at a private hospital in Bursa, Turkey. Participants were 34 patients diagnosed with CLBP, aged 18 to 55 years. Participants were divided into two groups with n = 17 in each group. Group 1 received conservative therapy and strengthening exercises, while Group 2 received conservative therapy and stabilization exercises. Both groups underwent 20 sessions over 4 weeks, 5 days a week. Range of motion, Transversus Abdominis muscle strength, pain intensity with Visual Analog Scale, quality of life with Short Form-12, Oswestry Disability Index, and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire were assessed pre- and post-treatment in both groups. Both exercise groups showed significant improvements in lumbar flexion (P = .011 for Group 1, P = 0.007 for Group 2), muscle strength (all P < .001), visual analog scale scores (all P = .033 - <.001), functionality (all P < .001), fear avoidance beliefs (P < .011 for Group 1, P = .012 for Group 2), and quality of life values (all P < .001) after treatment. However, no inter-group difference was found in any of the measurements (P = .177-.935). Although we observed improvement in pain level, functionality, fear avoidance beliefs, and quality of life in both groups, the interventions did not show any superiority to each other.
