Study Title: Effect of voxelotor on cerebral perfusion and cerebral oxygen metabolism and cardiac stress in adult patients with sickle cell disease.

Study Summary:
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is complicated by silent cerebral infarcts (SCIs), for which anemia is an important risk factor. Despite normal oxygen delivery (OD), cerebral vascular reserve (CVR), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO) are diminished in SCD, possibly causing the formation of SCIs. Voxelotor inhibits polymerization by increasing the hemoglobin oxygen binding, ameliorating hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, anemia is related to cardiac complications. Our aims were to assess the effect of voxelotor on markers of cerebral perfusion, cerebral oxygen metabolism, and markers of cardiac stress in SCD patients. Cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism were measured with MRI before and after 3&#x2009;months of voxelotor treatment (1500&#x2009;mg/day) in 18 adults with SCD (HbSS/HbS&#x3b2;-thalassemia). Hemoglobin levels significantly increased (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001) and markers of hemolysis decreased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). OD increased from 6.5 (IQR, 6.0-7.1) mL O/100&#x2009;g/min to 8.1 (IQR, 7.2-8.7) mL O/100&#x2009;g/min (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001). CBF and CVR did not change. CMROdecreased from 2.0 (IQR, 1.9-2.1) mL O/100&#x2009;g/min to 1.9 (IQR, 1.6-2.1) mL O/100&#x2009;g/min (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03). N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels decreased (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.048) and maximum tricuspid regurgitation flow velocity (TRV) normalized in all but one patient with increased TRV. Voxelotor treatment in patients with severe SCD did not decrease CBF despite increased Hb levels. Cerebral oxygen metabolism slightly decreased, despite raised OD, most likely due to drug-induced increase in oxygen binding. Nonetheless, voxelotor improved clinically validated markers of cardiac stress.
