Study Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial, Non-Nutrition Based mHealth Program: The Potential Impact on Dietary Intake in College Students.

Study Summary:
The aims of this study were to (1) explore this sample's pre- and post-intervention dietary intake, specifically the macro- and micronutrients, and their eating habits related to location of consumption and use of electronic devices, and (2) compare this sample's nutritional measures to the current Dietary Guidelines 2020 to 2025. Twenty-eight participants were included in the secondary data analysis. Participants reported a total of 822 items consumed during this study. Most items were consumed at home (&#x2009;=&#x2009;629, 76.5%). We found significant differences in the intake of energy, protein, total fat, carbohydrates, total vegetables, total grains, and total meat in different locations. For most of these measures, consumption at home and/or restaurants resulted in a greater magnitude of consumption than at other locations (e.g., car, daycare). Participants reported consuming most of their energy and nutrients while either using electronic devices alone (&#x2009;=&#x2009;365, 44.4%) or using no devices (&#x2009;=&#x2009;346, 42.1%). Significant differences were found among three measures including energy, total fat, and total fiber. The majority of the macronutrients (total fiber, fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy) consumed by our sample were under the threshold recommended in the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines.
