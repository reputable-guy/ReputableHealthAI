Study Title: Influence of sleep quality on lapse to alcohol use during a quit attempt.

Study Summary:
Sleep problems are common among individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and is often associated with a heightened relapse risk. The present study examines the relationship between sleep and alcohol use among individuals with current AUD during a 6-day quit attempt as part of a medication study. The current study is a secondary analysis of a medication trial for individuals with AUD. Individuals with AUD (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;53, 26 females) were randomized to active medication or matched placebo. Randomized participants completed a week-long medication titration (Days 1-7). Following the titration period, participants attended an in-person visit (Day 8) to begin a 6-day quit attempt. During the quit attempt, participants completed daily diary assessments to report on previous day alcohol consumption, sleep quality, and alcohol craving. In the present study, medication condition was controlled for in all models. Baseline global sleep quality was not a significant predictor of drinks per drinking day (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.72) or percent days abstinent (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.16) during the 6-day practice quit attempt. Daily diary analyses found that greater sleep quality was associated with higher next-day drinks per drinking day (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.198, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029). In contrast, participants reported worse sleep quality following nights of greater alcohol intake, albeit at a trend-level (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.12, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.053). These results suggest that better sleep quality was a risk factor for drinking during the 6-day quit period, such that better sleep may be associated with increased craving for alcohol and alcohol use the next day. These findings are limited to the early abstinence period and should be considered in studies exploring longer periods of abstinence.
