Study Title: Safety and efficacy of motor imagery-based physical activity in high-risk pregnancy: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of motor imagery-based physical activity on maternal well-being, maternal blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, fetal heart rate, and uterine contractions in women with high-risk pregnancies. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Izmir Tepecik Education and Research Hospital from August 2023 to January 2024. Seventy-six women with high-risk pregnancies were randomized into two groups: a motor imagery group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;38, diaphragmatic-breathing exercise and motor imagery-based physical activity) and a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;38, diaphragmatic-breathing exercise). Maternal well-being was determined using the Numerical Rating Scale-11. Digital sphygmomanometry was used to measure maternal heart rate and blood pressure, pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation, and cardiotocography for fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Assessments were performed pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and post-intervention. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). There was a significant main effect of time in terms of maternal well-being and maternal heart rate (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015). In addition, there was a significant main effect of the group on oxygen saturation (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025). The overall group-by-time interaction was significant for maternal well-beingm with an effect size of 0.05 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041). The combination of diaphragmatic-breathing exercises and a motor imagery-based physical activity program in women with high-risk pregnancies was determined to have no adverse effects on the fetus, did not induce uterine contractions, and resulted in a significant improvement in maternal well-being and oxygen saturation. Thus, imagery-based physical activity can be used in high-risk pregnancies where physical activity and exercise are not recommended.
