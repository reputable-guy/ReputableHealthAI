Study Title: Addressing Nursing Students' Anxiety During Simulation Sessions: A Pilot Intervention Study.

Study Summary:
Although simulation-based education plays a vital role in nursing education, it consistently induces high levels of anxiety among nursing students. This study aimed to implement a mindfulness intervention to alleviate anxiety in nursing students during simulation sessions. This randomized controlled trial study included 54 nursing students. Both survey and emotion track system data were collected and analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance. The intervention effectively reduced anxiety among students in the experimental group compared with students in the control group during simulation sessions. The frequency (F[1, 53] = 6.145,= .016), intensity (F[1, 51] = 3.771,= .050), and duration of anxiety felt by students (F[1, 50] = 4.223,= .017) decreased after the intervention. However, no long-term effects of the intervention were identified. The implementation of a mindfulness intervention successfully alleviated anxiety among nursing students during simulation..
