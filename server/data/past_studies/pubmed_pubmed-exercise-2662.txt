Study Title: Dose-response effects of caffeine during repeated cycling sprints in normobaric hypoxia to exhaustion.

Study Summary:
With limited studies exploring the dose-response of caffeine consumption on repeated sprint ability in hypoxia, this study aimed to determine the optimal caffeine dose (low, moderate or high) during repeated sprints in hypoxia to exhaustion. On separate visits, twelve active males randomly performed four experimental trials in normobaric hypoxia (inspired oxygen fraction: 16.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.2%). Participants ingested placebo (PLA) or caffeine capsules (3, 6 or 9&#xa0;mg/kg or LOW, MOD and HIGH, respectively) 1&#xa0;h before exercise and then underwent a repeated cycling sprint test (10&#xa0;s sprint/20&#xa0;s active recovery) to exhaustion. Total sprint number and work done, peak and mean power output, blood lactate concentration, cardiorespiratory and perceptual responses were recorded. Total sprint number was greater in MOD and HIGH compared to PLA (20&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7 and 18&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8 vs. 13&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4; all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), with MOD also higher than LOW (15&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Total work done was greater in MOD (111&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;40&#xa0;kJ) and HIGH (100&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;35&#xa0;kJ) compared to LOW (83&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;29&#xa0;kJ) and PLA (76&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;25&#xa0;kJ) (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). However, there were no significant differences in total sprint number or total work done between MOD and HIGH (all P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Blood lactate concentration was higher in both MOD and HIGH compared to PLA (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). However, peak and mean power outputs, fatigue index, and ratings of perceived exertion did not differ across different caffeine dosages (all P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). A moderate dose of caffeine (6&#xa0;mg/kg) is the optimal amount for enhancing repeated cycling sprint ability when compared to low and high doses in moderate normobaric hypoxia.
