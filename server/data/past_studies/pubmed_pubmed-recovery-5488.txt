Study Title: Desflurane versus sevoflurane anesthesia and postoperative recovery in older adults undergoing minor- to moderate-risk noncardiac surgery - A prospective, randomized, observer-blinded, clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The effect of volatile anesthetics on postoperative recovery in older adults is still not entirely clear. Thus, we evaluated the effect of desflurane versus sevoflurane anesthesia on speed of postoperative recovery in older adults eligible for same-day discharge. We further evaluated the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), bispectral index (BIS) values, and S100B concentrations. Single-center, prospective, observer-blinded, randomized clinical trial. Operating room. 190 patients &#x2265;65&#xa0;years of age and scheduled for minor- to moderate-risk noncardiac surgeries. Goal-directed administration of desflurane versus sevoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia with an intraoperative goal of BIS 50&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5. The primary outcome was the time to anesthesia recovery, which was defined as the time between arrival at the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and reaching criteria for discharge from PACU, based on modified Aldrete score&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;12 points. Modified Aldrete scores were assessed at PACU arrival and thereafter in five-minute intervals. PONV was evaluated during PACU stay and the first three postoperative days, BIS values were recorded during PACU stay, and S100B values were measured before and after surgery, and on the second postoperative day. 95 patients were randomized to receive desflurane, and 95 patients to receive sevoflurane. We did not observe a significant difference in median duration of postoperative recovery between the groups (desflurane: 0&#xa0;min [0;0]; sevoflurane: 0&#xa0;min [0;0]; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.245). 77 patients (81.1%) in the desflurane group and 84 patients (88.4%) in the sevoflurane group already had Aldrete scores &#x2265;12 points upon arrival at PACU (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.277). There was also no significant difference in the incidences of PONV (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.606), postoperative BIS values (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.197), and postoperative maximum S100B concentrations (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.821) between the groups. Despite previous reports, we did not observe significant faster recovery times after desflurane anesthesia. Both volatile anesthetics may be appropriate for same-day discharge in older adults.
