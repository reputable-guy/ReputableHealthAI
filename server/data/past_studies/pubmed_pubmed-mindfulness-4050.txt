Study Title: Study protocol for a single-arm pilot trial investigating the feasibility of a multimodal digital technology for managing metabolic syndrome in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Study Summary:
Individuals diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are exposed to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which negatively affects their health outcomes and quality of life. Lifestyle interventions have shown promise in managing MetS. This study outlines the protocol for a web-based multimodal self-care program, Digital Metabolic Rehabilitation, for managing MetS in patients with COPD. The Digital Metabolic Rehabilitation is a single-arm pilot trial that integrates the Canadian Health Advanced by Nutrition and Graded Exercise (CHANGE) Program and a web-based wellness platform. The web-based wellness platform employed in this study is My Viva Plan (MVP)&#xae;, which integrates a holistic, multicomponent approach to promote wellness. The intervention will primarily focus on lifestyle changes for patients with COPD. Over 6&#xa0;months, participants will use the web-based wellness platform and engage in weekly online support group sessions. Fifty patients diagnosed with stage I-II COPD and MetS will participate. Blood tests, anthropometrics, body composition, physical function, muscle strength, physical activity, energy metabolism, quality of life and mental health will be assessed at baseline, 3, and 6&#xa0;months. The Digital Metabolic Rehabilitation program aims to explore whether a multimodal integrative intervention delivered through a web-based wellness platform can be implemented by patients with COPD with MetS. By combining the expertise of the CHANGE Program with the digital delivery format, the intervention seeks to enhance self-monitoring and foster better self-management practices. The protocol outlines a novel and potentially impactful intervention for managing MetS in patients with COPD.
