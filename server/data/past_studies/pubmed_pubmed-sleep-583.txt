Study Title: The Effect of 14-Day Consumption of Hydrogen-Rich Water Alleviates Fatigue but Does Not Ameliorate Dyspnea in Long-COVID Patients: A Pilot, Single-Blind, and Randomized, Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: Hydrogen (H) may be a potential therapeutic agent for managing Long COVID symptoms due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, more scientific literature is needed to describe the effects of Hadministration on treating symptoms. A study aimed to investigate the impact of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) administration on the fatigue and dyspnea of Long-COVID patients for 14 consecutive days. (2) Methods: In this randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study, 55 participants were recruited, and 23 of them were excluded. A total of 32 eligible participants were randomized into a hydrogen-rich water (HRW) group (= 16) and a placebo water (PW) group (= 16) in which they were instructed to consume hydrogen-rich water or placebo water for 14 days, respectively. The participants completed the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), 30 s Chair Stand Test (30s-CST), Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Rating Scale (mMRC), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21) before and after the intervention. A linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the effects of HRW. Cohen's d values were used to assess the effect size when significance was observed. The mean change with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was also reported. (3) Results: The effects of HRW on lowering FSS scores (= 0.046, [95% CI = -20.607, -0.198, d = 0.696] and improving total distance in the 6WMT (< 0.001, [95% CI = 41.972, 61.891], d = 1.010), total time for the 30s-CST (= 0.002, [95% CI = 1.570, 6.314], d = 1.190), and PSQI scores (= 0.012, [95% CI = -5.169, 0.742], d = 1.274) compared to PW were of a significantly moderate effect size, while there was no significant difference in mMRC score (= 0.556) or DASS-21 score (> 0.143). (4) Conclusions: This study demonstrates that HRW might be an effective strategy for alleviating fatigue and improving cardiorespiratory endurance, musculoskeletal function, and sleep quality. Still, it does not ameliorate dyspnea among Long-COVID patients.
