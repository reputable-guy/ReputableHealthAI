Study Title: Empowering Wellness: A Comprehensive Narrative Review of Cancer Prehabilitation from Treatment Onset to Surveillance.

Study Summary:
Cancer prehabilitation, defined as a process occurring between cancer diagnosis and the onset of acute treatment, is highlighted for its ability to enhance physical and mental health results while decreasing overall healthcare costs. This summary introduces the concept of cancer prehabilitation and emphasises the crucial role of oncology nurses in rehabilitation care. The cancer treatment plan of prehabilitation requires timely and efficient assessment across the care continuum, focusing on enhancing outcomes at every stage of cancer. The battle with cancer involves three different assessments with distinct goals: i) prehabilitation evaluation before treatment, ii) early post-treatment evaluations of rehabilitation and iii) final evaluations of health promotion. Analyses and treatments for significant side effects or complications associated with the treatment specifically for prehabilitation are recommended. The roles of coordination, counseling, preparing for discharge and teaching are outlined as integral components of a cancer nurse's responsibilities in the prevention of cancer. A literature search from March 2016 to June 2023 was conducted using the keywords 'neoplasms,' 'cancer,' 'prehabilitation,' 'continuum of care,' 'care continuum,' 'patient care continuity,' 'epidemiology,' 'therapeutics,' 'health,' 'prevention and control' and 'guidelines as topic.' The findings suggest that care coordinators or navigators for cancer should be educated to assess the physical and psychological status of patients once a cancer diagnosis is confirmed, particularly for those awaiting surgery at home. To enhance their competence in prehabilitation care, oncology nurses are encouraged to gain knowledge of certain tumours' outcomes and cancer-related treatments. Additionally, improving the ability to evaluate patients' functional status and emotional distress is crucial for oncology nurses involved in cancer prehabilitation.
