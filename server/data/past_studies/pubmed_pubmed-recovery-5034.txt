Study Title: Comparison of the therapeutic effects of different pneumoperitoneum pressures on laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair: a randomized controlled trail.

Study Summary:
To compare the indicators, postoperative pneumoretroperitoneum-related complications, and postoperative recovery of laparoscopic preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair under different CO2 pneumoperitoneum pressures. The total of 187 adult patients with primary inguinal hernia who successfully underwent transabdominal preperitoneal prosthesis (TAPP) from September 2021 to September 2023 in the Department of General Surgery, Haimen People's Hospital affiliated to Nantong University, were collected. These patients were randomly divided into low abdominal pressure group (group A: pneumoperitoneum pressure = 8 mmHg), sub-low abdominal pressure group (group B: pneumoperitoneum pressure = 10 mmHg), moderate abdominal pressure group (group C: pneumoperitoneum pressure = 12 mmHg), and standard pressure group (group D: pneumoperitoneum pressure = 14 mmHg), with 40 patients each. The operation time in group C (43.90 &#xb1; 9.75) was significantly lower than group A (51.98 &#xb1; 12.65, p 0.001), group B (46.70 &#xb1; 10.59, p 0.001), and was higher than that in group D without significant statistical differences (38.15 &#xb1; 7.98, P = 0.05). The peritoneal suturing time in group C (5.03 &#xb1; 1.07) was significantly higher than group A (4.23 &#xb1; 0.70, p 0.001), group B (4.55 &#xb1; 0.85, p = 0.03), and was significantly lower than that in group D (6.95 &#xb1; 1.96, p 0.001). Selecting sub-low abdominal pressure (12 mmHg) can help to have a shorter operation time, with less blood loss, and it did not add pneumoretroperitoneum-related complications. Changing the pneumoperitonium pressure during different phases of the surgery is also an optimal option.
