Study Title: Underpinning the Food Matrix Regulation of Postexercise Myofibrillar Protein Synthesis by Comparing Salmon Ingestion With the Sum of Its Isolated Nutrients in Healthy Young Adults.

Study Summary:
Protein is most commonly consumed as whole foods as opposed to single nutrients. However, the food matrix regulation of the postprandial muscle protein synthetic response has received little attention. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of eating salmon (SAL) and of ingesting the same nutrients as an isolated mixture of crystalline amino acids and fish oil (ISO) on the stimulation of postexercise myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) and whole-body leucine oxidation rates in healthy young adults. Ten recreationally active adults (24 &#xb1; 4 y; 5 men, 5 women) performed an acute bout of resistance exercise, followed by the ingestion of SAL or ISO in a crossover fashion. Blood, breath, and muscle biopsies were collected at rest and after exercise during primed continuous infusions of L-[ring-H]phenylalanine and L-[1-C]leucine. All data are presented as means &#xb1; SD and/or mean differences (95% CIs). Postprandial essential amino acid (EAA) concentrations peaked earlier (P = 0.024) in the ISO group than those in the SAL group. Postprandial leucine oxidation rates increased over time (P < 0.001) and peaked earlier in the ISO group (1.239 &#xb1; 0.321 nmol/kg/min; 63 &#xb1; 25 min) than those in the SAL group (1.230 &#xb1; 0.561 nmol/kg/min; 105 &#xb1; 20 min; P = 0.003). MPS rates for SAL (0.056 &#xb1; 0.022 %/h; P = 0.001) and ISO (0.046 &#xb1; 0.025 %/h; P = 0.025) were greater than the basal rates (0.020 &#xb1; 0.011 %/h) during the 0- to 5-h recovery period, with no differences between conditions (P = 0.308). We showed that the postexercise ingestion of SAL or ISO stimulate postexercise MPS rates with no differences between the conditions. Thus, our results indicate that ingesting protein from SAL as a whole-food matrix is similarly anabolic to ISO in healthy young adults. This trial was registered at www. gov as NCT03870165.
