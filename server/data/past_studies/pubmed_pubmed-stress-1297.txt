Study Title: Integrating Yoga into Comprehensive Cancer Care: Starting Somewhere.

Study Summary:
The rapid increase in cancer survivors in the United States (US) highlights the importance of survivors' long-term care needs and symptom management. Given evidence that yoga supports cancer related symptoms, our aim was to develop and implement a community yoga program available for cancer survivors, family members, and staff involved in cancer care at a public comprehensive cancer center in the US. Given the wide age range and potential side effects from cancer treatment, we adapted the yoga program to meet the needs of cancer survivors. Beginning in May 2017, we offered sixty-minute gentle yoga sessions for all medically cleared cancer survivors and their family members, caregivers, and friends, as well as oncology staff. We aimed to evaluate acceptability, development, and implementation of an adaptive yoga program at our comprehensive cancer center using mixed methods. Classes were initially offered once a week, then increased to twice a week. A total of five service evaluations were sent approximately every six months between April 2018-October 2019 to evaluate participant satisfaction (n=90 responses). Qualitative data were collected and analyzed using thematic analysis of participant satisfaction, allowing us to continuously monitor the yoga program and adjust to meet participants' needs. Between May 2017 and February 2020, 176 people attended our program. Ages ranged from 21 to 72 years, with an average age of 45 years. Based on these evaluations, 96% (n=86) of participants rated both the program and teachers excellent, and 4% (n=4) rated the program and teachers good. Qualitative themes highlighted positive aspects of the program, including accessibility, inclusivity, and adaptive yoga based on medical needs, skill level, and abilities. Adaptive yoga programs are well-accepted by cancer survivors and caregivers and may contribute a solution to healthcare staff and physician burnout. It is essential to build a solid foundation of self-care and wellness programming for cancer survivors and to create and foster adaptive yoga classes. Next steps for our program include evaluating yoga within the clinical setting, including chemotherapy infusion center and further research on reduction in stress through yoga in cancer survivors.
