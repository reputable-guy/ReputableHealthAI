Study Title: An mHealth Intervention for Gay and Bisexual Men's Mental, Behavioral, and Sexual Health in a High-Stigma, Low-Resource Context (Project Comunic&#x103;): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The World Health Organization reported that 80% of new HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014 occurred in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania has a particularly high HIV incidence, AIDS prevalence, and number of related deaths. HIV incidence in Romania is largely attributed to sexual contact among gay and bisexual men. However, homophobic stigma in Romania serves as a risk factor for HIV infection for gay and bisexual men. The Comunic&#x103; intervention aims to provide a much-needed HIV risk reduction strategy, and it entails the delivery of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy skills across 8 live text-based counseling sessions on a mobile platform to gay and bisexual men at risk of HIV. The intervention is based on the information-motivation-behavior and minority stress models. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that Comunic&#x103; holds promise for reducing gay and bisexual men's co-occurring sexual (eg, HIV transmission risk behavior), behavioral (eg, heavy alcohol use), and mental (eg, depression) health risks in Romania. This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of Comunic&#x103; in a national trial. To test Comunic&#x103;'s efficacy, 305 gay and bisexual men were randomized to receive Comunic&#x103; or a content-matched education attention control condition. The control condition consisted of 8 time-matched educational modules that present information regarding gay and bisexual men's identity development, information about HIV transmission and prevention, the importance of HIV and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, heavy alcohol use and its associations with HIV transmission risk behavior, sexual health communication, finding social support, and creating sexual health goals. Participants undergo rapid HIV and syphilis testing and 3-site chlamydia and gonorrhea testing at baseline and the 12-month follow-up. Outcomes are measured before the intervention (baseline) and at the 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. The study was funded in September 2018, and data collection began in May 2019. The last participant follow-up was in January 2024. Currently, the data analyst is cleaning data sets in preparation for data analyses, which are scheduled to begin in April 2024. Data analysis meetings are scheduled regularly to establish timelines and examine the results as analyses are gradually being conducted. Upon completion, a list of manuscripts will be reviewed and prioritized, and the team will begin preparing them for publication. This study is the first to test the efficacy of an intervention with the potential to simultaneously support the sexual, behavioral, and mental health of gay and bisexual men in Central and Eastern Europe using motivational interviewing support and sensitivity to the high-stigma context of the region. If efficacious, Comunic&#x103; presents a scalable platform to provide support to gay and bisexual men living in Romania and similar high-stigma, low-resource countries.
