Study Title: Randomized controlled trial of the glycine transporter 1 inhibitor PF-03463275 to enhance cognitive training and neuroplasticity in schizophrenia.

Study Summary:
N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is implicated in the impaired neuroplasticity and cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). We hypothesized that enhancing NMDAR function by inhibiting the glycine transporter-1 (GLYT1) would improve neuroplasticity and thereby augment benefits of non-pharmacological cognitive training (CT) strategies. This study examined whether co-administration of a GLYT1 inhibitor and computerized CT would have synergistic effects on CIAS. Stable outpatients with schizophrenia participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, crossover augmentation study. Participants received placebo or GLYT1 inhibitor (PF-03463275) for two 5-week periods separated by 2&#xa0;weeks of washout. PF-03463275 doses (40 or 60&#xa0;mg twice daily) were selected to produce high GLYT1 occupancy. To limit pharmacodynamic variability, only cytochrome P450 2D6 extensive metabolizers were included. Medication adherence was confirmed daily. Participants received 4&#xa0;weeks of CT in each treatment period. Cognitive performance (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery) and psychotic symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) were assessed in each period. 71 participants were randomized. PF-03463275 in combination with CT was feasible, safe, and well-tolerated at the doses prescribed but did not produce greater improvement in CIAS compared to CT alone. PF-03463275 was not associated with improved CT learning parameters. Participation in CT was associated with improvement in MCCB scores.
