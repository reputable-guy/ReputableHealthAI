Study Title: Comparative Analysis of Radial Corrective Osteotomy and Sauv&#xe9;-Kapandji Procedure for Malunited Distal Radius Fractures in Older Adults.

Study Summary:
Malunited distal radius fractures frequently occur in the older population, posing a dilemma in selecting ideal management for symptomatic patients. Radial corrective osteotomy (RCO) and the Sauv&#xe9;-Kapandji procedure (SK) have been used to treat this challenging condition. However, it remains unknown which approach is better for the older population. The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of RCO with those of SK for the treatment of symptomatic distal radius malunion in older adults. Thirty-three patients aged &#x2265;60 years, with malunited distal radius fractures, were randomized to be treated with either RCO or SK and followed for a minimum of 2 years. The primary evaluation parameter was grip strength, and secondary outcome parameters were surgical time, range of motion of the wrist, exercise-related wrist pain assessment using visual analog scale scores, radiographic results, patient-reported outcomes evaluated using the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), and Patient-Related Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores. The average follow-up duration was 36.7 &#xb1; 10.2 months. The grip strength was significantly higher in the RCO group. The surgical time was shorter in the SK group than in the RCO group. The postoperative wrist range of motion and visual analog scale scores for exercise-related pain alleviation were similar in both groups. The ulnar variance decreased in both groups and was similar when compared with the postoperative images. The DASH and PRWE scores were similar between the RCO and SK groups. Radial corrective osteotomy and SK surgeries have similar clinical and functional outcomes in patients aged &#x2265;60 years. Grip strength is higher in the RCO group than in the SK group. However, the operating time to accomplish SK is shorter than RCO. Therapeutic II.
