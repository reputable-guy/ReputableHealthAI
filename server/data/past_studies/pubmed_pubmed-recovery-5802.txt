Study Title: Effectiveness of video-based psychiatric rehabilitation for patients with early-phase schizophrenia spectrum: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to establish a comprehensive set of recovery-oriented rehabilitation programs for individuals with schizophrenia, comparing the efficacy of video-based rehabilitation to traditional face-to-face interventions. The primary objective was to assess whether video-based rehabilitation could serve as a viable alternative for individuals with schizophrenia residing in remote areas. A randomized controlled study was used to recruit 80 patients with schizophrenia in a stable post-hospitalization stage following discharge. Participants were categorized into three groups: 24 in the control group, 21 in the face-to-face group, and 35 in the remote group. Assessment parameters included psychiatric symptoms, social skills, family function and self-stigma. A total of 68 participants completed the program. The findings indicated significant differences (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05) between the control group and intervention group, particularly in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The rehabilitation program, tailored for patients in the early phase of the schizophrenia spectrum, demonstrates both effectiveness and feasibility in enhancing clinical symptoms and social functions. Notably, interventions conducted via video proved to be equally effective as those administered face-to-face.
