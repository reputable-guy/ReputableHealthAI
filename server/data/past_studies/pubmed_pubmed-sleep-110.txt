Study Title: The Effects of Resveratrol in a Randomized Clinical Trial on Drug-Induced Hyperlipidemia and Psychiatric Factors in People Living with HIV.

Study Summary:
People living with HIV (PLHIV) suffer from a range of consequences related to infection, including hyperlipidemia and neurologic and sleep disorders. Supplements containing phenolic compounds with high antioxidant properties can reduce these side effects. Resveratrol is a phenolic compound that improves the symptoms of diabetes, cancer, and viral infections. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on hyperlipidemia and neurological problems in PLHIV in Iran. In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 41 PLHIV were randomly assigned to two groups: a placebo group (n=21) and a resveratrol group (n=20). Triglyceride and cholesterol levels were determined for all the subjects before and one month after they used the medication. Additionally, standard questionnaires were used to evaluate the quality of sleep, stress, depression, and quality of life of the participants. The data were analyzed via analysis of covariance in Stata 17.0. The study population did not significantly differ in terms of age (p=0.49), sex (p=0.09), marital status (p=0.90), level of education (p=0.90), duration of HIV infection (p=0.54), or mode of HIV transmission (p=0.51). The administration of resveratrol did not affect psychological parameters or blood cholesterol (p=0.091) or triglyceride (p=0.932) levels. The administration of resveratrol did not affect cholesterol or triglyceride levels or the rates of depression, anxiety, sleep quality, or quality of life in PLHIV. The resveratrol supplementation in a large-scale clinical study involving more patients for a longer course of treatment may have had more significant effects on the serum levels of lipids and psychological factors.
