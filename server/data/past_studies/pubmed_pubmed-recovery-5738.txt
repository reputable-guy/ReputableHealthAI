Study Title: Comprehensive evaluation of advanced platelet-rich fibrin in common complications following sagittal split ramus osteotomy: a double-blind, split-mouth, randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) carries potential risks and complications. A double-blind, split-mouth, randomized clinical trial was performed, involving 30 patients undergoing mandibular setback. Advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) was applied to one side, and the other side served as a control. The volume of postoperative drainage over 24&#xa0;h was recorded. At 1, 2, and 5 days, and 3 months postsurgery, nerve recovery was assessed using the two-point discrimination test (TPD), while pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS pain). Facial swelling was evaluated by taking linear measurements from facial reference points at the same time intervals. In the treatment group, the 24-hour drainage volume was lower (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011), pain was better on day 5 (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011), and TPD was better on day 2 (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011), day 5 (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007), and 3 months postoperatively (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.020) than in the control group. There was also less facial swelling in the treatment group when compared to the baseline of 3 months postoperative (day 1, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.012; day 2, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001; day 5, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011). The difference in bone mineral density (HU) at 3 months between the treatment group (469.7&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;134.2) and the control group (348.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;127.2) was statistically significant (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011), in favour of the treatment group. A-PRF may reduce postoperative complications such as neurosensory disturbance of the inferior alveolar nerve, pain, swelling, and drainage while enhancing bone healing in the osteotomy gap following SSRO. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR2200064534).
