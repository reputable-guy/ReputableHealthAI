Study Title: The Duration of Non-Local Muscle Fatigue Effects.

Study Summary:
Non-local muscle fatigue (NLMF) refers to a transient decline in the functioning of a non-exercised muscle following the fatigue of a different muscle group. Most studies examining NLMF conducted post-tests immediately after the fatiguing protocols, leaving the duration of these effects uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the duration of NLMF (1-, 3-, and 5-minutes). In this randomized crossover study, 17 recreationally trained participants (four females) were tested for the acute effects of unilateral knee extensor (KE) muscle fatigue on the contralateral homologous muscle strength, and activation. Each of the four sessions included testing at either 1-, 3-, or 5-minutes post-test, as well as a control condition for non-dominant KE peak force, instantaneous strength (force produced within the first 100-ms), and vastus lateralis and biceps femoris electromyography (EMG). The dominant KE fatigue intervention protocol involved two sets of 100-seconds maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) separated by 1-minute of rest. Non-dominant KE MVIC forces showed moderate and small magnitude reductions at 1-min (p < 0.0001, d = 0.72) and 3-min (p = 0.005, d = 0.30) post-test respectively. The KE MVIC instantaneous strength revealed large magnitude, significant reductions between 1-min (p = 0.021, d = 1.33), and 3-min (p = 0.041, d = 1.13) compared with the control. In addition, EMG data revealed large magnitude increases with the 1-minute versus control condition (p = 0.03, d = 1.10). In summary, impairments of the non-exercised leg were apparent up to 3-minutes post-exercise with no significant deficits at 5-minutes. Recovery duration plays a crucial role in the manifestation of NLMF.
