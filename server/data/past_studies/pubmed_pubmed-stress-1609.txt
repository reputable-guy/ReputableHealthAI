Study Summary:
The study aims to evaluate the effect of yoga on the premenstrual syndrome, perceived stress level and the quality of life. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial at a university in Turkey. A yoga group = 39, a control group = 41, total of n = 80 female students participated in the study. In the study, firstly, the preview was made, then the yoga group was applied two days a week for eight weeks, the second follow-up was made after the application, and lastly, the last follow-up was made in the 24th week. Four questionnaire surveys were applied on students. When the yoga group compared with the control group in terms of premenstrual syndrome, the quality of life and perceived stress level in the 2nd follow-up, a statistically significant decrease was found in the mean between the menstrual and premenstrual period, and the quality of life increases in the yoga group compared to the control group students. Practicing yoga in university students with premenstrual syndrome reduced premenstrual symptoms and raised quality of life. Yoga can be recommended to girls with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) to reduce PMS and improve quality of life.
