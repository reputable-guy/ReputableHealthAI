Study Title: Exploring relationships with food after dietary intervention in patients with colorectal cancer: a qualitative analysis from the Protein Recommendations to Increase Muscle (PRIMe) trial.

Study Summary:
Patients with cancer often experience nutritional challenges and are vulnerable to muscle mass loss. While substantial research is directed towards understanding how nutritional interventions affect clinical outcomes, insights into patients' personal experiences during these trials remain limited. This qualitative study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how participation in the Protein Recommendations to Increase Muscle (PRIMe) trial affected patients' relationships with food. A subset of patients who completed a minimum of one follow-up visit in the PRIMe trial participated in a semi-structured interview about their experience implementing dietary modifications to increase protein intake. Data from 26 patients with a recent diagnosis of stage II-IV colorectal cancer (non-cachectic) were included. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and qualitative content analysis was applied. Most patients were male (65.4%) with stage II or III (69.2%) colorectal cancer and were a mean age of 57&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10&#xa0;years. Five key themes emerged to provide a deeper understanding of patients' relationship with food after the PRIMe trial: (1) new positive perspectives on nutrition and coping with a cancer diagnosis; (2) embracing a comprehensive approach to food and nutrition; (3) facilitators promoting adherence to the intervention; (4) barriers challenging adherence to the intervention; and (5) shaping future dietary intake. This qualitative study explored the emotional and psychological effects of a clinical nutrition trial on patients, focusing on their relationship with food. It underscored the trial's comprehensive intervention and its enduring influence on patients, extending beyond the immediate intervention phase. The role of current perspectives, motivation, and knowledge acquisition on ability to adhere to dietary changes to increase protein intake were emphasized by patients and are key considerations for both clinicians and researchers.
