Study Title: Efficacy of tissue-bone homeostasis manipulation on the gait and knee function for the patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) was characterized by pain and limited joint function, which seriously affected the quality of life of patients. The vast majority of KOA was closely related to degeneration of the patellofemoral joint and abnormal patellar movement trajectory. Tissue-bone homeostasis manipulation (TBHM) could correct abnormal patellar movement trajectory on the basis of loosening soft tissue. However, there was little strong evidence to verify its efficacy on the patients with KOA. The study objective was to explore the efficacy of the TBHM on gait and knee function in the patients with KOA. Sixty KOA patients were randomly assigned to either the joint mobilization (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) or TBHM (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) group. The joint mobilization group received joint mobilization, while the TBHM group received TBHM. For two groups, the patients participated in 30&#xa0;min rehabilitation sessions thrice per week for 12&#xa0;weeks. The primary outcome was biomechanical gait outcomes during walking, including step length, step velocity, double support, knee range of motion (ROM), and knee adduction moment (KAM). The secondary outcomes were the Western Ontario and McMaster Index (WOMAC) and 36-Item short- form health survey (SF-36), which reflected improvements in knee function and quality of life, respectively. At baseline and 12&#xa0;weeks, evaluations were conducted and compared between groups. After a 12-week intervention, significant group differences were observed in KAM (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), WOMAC-Pain (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043) and WOMAC-Stiffness (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026). A noteworthy finding was the presence of a significant interaction effect between group and time specifically observed in step velocity during gait (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046), WOMAC-Function (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and SF-36 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027). Further analysis revealed a significant difference in step velocity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034), WOMAC-Function (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025) and SF-36 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) during post-assessment between the two groups. Moreover, a significant time effect was observed across all outcomes of the two groups (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The TBHM intervention has better improved the gait, knee function, and quality of life in the patients with KOA. ITMCTR, ITMCTR2200005507.
