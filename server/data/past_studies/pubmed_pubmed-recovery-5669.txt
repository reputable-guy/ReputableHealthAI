Study Title: Systemic lidocaine versus erector spinae plane block for improving quality of recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To compare intravenous lidocaine, ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB), and placebo on the quality of recovery and analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective, triple-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial. A single tertiary academic medical center. 126 adults aged 18-65&#xa0;years undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups: intravenous lidocaine infusion (1.5&#xa0;mg/kg bolus followed by 2&#xa0;mg/kg/h) plus bilateral ESPB with saline (25&#xa0;mL per side); bilateral ESPB with 0.25% ropivacaine (25&#xa0;ml per side) plus placebo infusion; or bilateral ESPB with saline (25&#xa0;ml per side) plus placebo infusion. The primary outcome was the 24-h postoperative Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score. The non-inferiority of lidocaine versus ESPB was assessed with a margin of -6 points and 97.5% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes included 24-h area under the curve (AUC) for pain scores, morphine consumption, and adverse events. 124 patients completed the study. Median (IQR) 24-h QoR-15 scores were 123 (117-127) for lidocaine, 124 (119-126) for ESPB, and 112 (108-117) for placebo. Lidocaine was non-inferior to ESPB (median difference&#xa0; -1, 97.5% CI: -4 to &#x221e;). Both lidocaine (median difference 9, 95% CI: 6-12, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and ESPB (median difference 10, 95% CI: 7-13, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) were superior to placebo. AUC for pain scores and morphine use were lower with lidocaine and ESPB versus placebo (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001 for all), with no significant differences between lidocaine and ESPB. One ESPB patient reported a transient metallic taste; no other block-related complications occurred. For patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intravenous lidocaine provides a non-inferior quality of recovery compared to ESPB without requiring specialized regional anesthesia procedures. Lidocaine may offer a practical and accessible alternative within multimodal analgesia pathways.
