Study Title: Dexmedetomidine HCL (BXCL501) as a potential treatment for alcohol use disorder and comorbid PTSD: A phase 1b, placebo-controlled crossover laboratory study.

Study Summary:
Noradrenergic dysregulation is important in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD); pharmacotherapies targeting adrenergic function have potential as treatment for comorbidity. Dexmedetomidine (sublingual film formulation-BXCL501; IGALMI) is a highly potent, selective &#x237a;2-adrenergic receptor agonist and may be superior to other pharmacotherapeutic approaches. A within subjects, phase 1b safety laboratory study was conducted to evaluate adverse effects of BXCL501 when combined with alcohol; BXCL501's potential efficacy was also explored. Heavy drinker participants with a diagnosis of or who were at risk for PTSD participated in three separate test days which included pretreatment with BXCL501 (40&#x2009;&#xb5;g, 80&#x2009;&#xb5;g or placebo) administered in a randomized, double-blind fashion, followed by three testing conditions: alcohol cue reactivity, trauma-induced reactivity, and IV ethanol administration. Safety outcomes included blood pressure (BP) and sedation. Exploratory outcomes included alcohol craving, trauma-induced anxiety and craving and subjective effects of alcohol. Ten of twelve randomized participants competed the entire study. BXCL501 (80&#x2009;&#xb5;g) was associated with expected mild changes in BP and sedation; administration with alcohol did not affect those parameters. There were no clinically significant adverse effects. BXCL501 attenuated trauma-induced anxiety and attenuated subjective effects of alcohol. BXCL501 is safe for use in humans who may drink alcohol while undergoing treatment. BXCL501 may be explored as a potential treatment for PTSD and AUD. This is the first study to provide scientific support for BXCL501's potential to treat PTSD and comorbid AUD.
