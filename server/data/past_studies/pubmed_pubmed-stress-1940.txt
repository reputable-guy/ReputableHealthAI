Study Title: Effectiveness of the Bilateral and Bilevel Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) in Pediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis Surgery: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to compare the effect of the ultrasound-guided bilateral and bilevel erector spinae plane block (ESPB) on pain scores, opioid requirement, intraoperative motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and stress response to surgery expressed by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) versus standard analgesia methods following idiopathic scoliosis surgery. This was a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Sixty patients aged 10 to 18 years and physical status ASA 1 or 2 were randomized into 2 equal groups, each receiving an ESPB or sham block. The primary outcome was the pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale, NRS) within 48 hours after spinal correction and fusion surgery for idiopathic thoracic scoliosis. The secondary outcomes were total opioid consumption, NLR, and PLR levels at 12 and 24 hours postoperatively and intraoperative MEPs. ESPB patients presented lower NRS scores, signifying less pain, at all time points (30, 60, 90, 120&#x2009;min; and 6, 12, 24, and 48&#x2009;h after surgery), all P <0.0001. The total opioid consumption, the incidence of nausea or vomiting, and the need for remifentanil and propofol during surgery were significantly lower in the ESPB group. The surgery-induced stress response expressed by NLR and PLR was considerably lower in the ESPB group. ESPB did not affect the intraoperative MEP's amplitude. ESPB is effective for postoperative analgesia, can reduce opioid consumption in patients undergoing scoliosis surgery, and reduces the stress response to surgery. ESPB does not interfere with neuromonitoring. Level I.
