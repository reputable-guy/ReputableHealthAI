Study Title: The combination of oxytocin and mindfulness-based group therapy for empathy and negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders - A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study.

Study Summary:
Treatment options for social cognition and negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) remain limited. Oxytocin could be a promising augmentation approach, but the social context influences the effect in humans. This pilot study hypothesized that oxytocin in a positive social setting through mindfulness-based group therapy (MBGT) would positively affect empathy and negative symptoms as well as affect and stress in an exploratory approach in SSD. An experimental, randomized, double-blinded (participants, psychotherapists), placebo-controlled pilot study with 41 individuals with SSD was conducted at the Charit&#xe9; - Universit&#xe4;tsmedizin Berlin. Oxytocin or placebo (24 I.U.) was administered intranasally 45&#xa0;min before two sessions of MBGT each. A 2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;2 mixed model ANCOVA design was calculated to assess empathy by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index and the Multifaceted Empathy Test and negative symptoms by the Self-Evaluation of Negative Symptoms. No benefit of oxytocin compared to placebo on empathy was observed, but significant between-group differences favoring oxytocin were found regarding the negative symptoms Diminished emotional range and Avolition. Negative affect and stress were significantly reduced compared to baseline. Mindfulness increased in both groups. Results indicated protocol adherence and retention rate of 91.1%, a drop-out rate of 8.9 % and a completion of 96 % of all sessions by the participants. No severe adverse events or side effects were reported. Our findings indicate proof-of-concept and suggest a potential role of oxytocin on negative symptoms and related variables in SSD in combination with MBGT. Future research should examine the stability of these effects with larger sample sizes.
