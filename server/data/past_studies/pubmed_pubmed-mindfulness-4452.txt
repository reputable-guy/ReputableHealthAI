Study Title: A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for body dysmorphic disorder: Impact on core symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and executive functioning.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is garnering increasing empirical interest as an intervention for Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), although no studies of mindfulness as a standalone treatment have included a sample composed entirely of patients with BDD or a comparison group. The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement of MBCT intervention on the core symptoms, emotional dysfunction, and executive function of BDD patients, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training. Patients with BDD were randomized into an 8-week MBCT group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;58) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;58) and were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Participants who received MBCT showed greater improvement on self-reported and clinician ratings of BDD symptoms, self-reported emotion dysregulation symptoms and executive function compared with TAU participants. Improvement for executive function tasks was partially supported. In addition, feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training were positive. There is no systematic assessment of the severity of key potential outcome variables associated with BDD. MBCT may be a useful intervention for patients with BDD, improving patients' BDD symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and executive functioning.
