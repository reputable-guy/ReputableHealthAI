Study Title: Rationale, study design and implementation of the LUCINDA Trial: Leuprolide plus Cholinesterase Inhibition to reduce Neurologic Decline in Alzheimer's.

Study Summary:
The LUCINDA Trial (Leuprolide plus Cholinesterase Inhibition to reduce Neurologic Decline in Alzheimer's) is a 52&#xa0;week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of leuprolide acetate (Eligard) in women with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Leuprolide acetate is a gonadotropin analogue commonly used for hormone-sensitive conditions such as prostate cancer and endometriosis. This repurposed drug demonstrated efficacy in a previous Phase II clinical trial in those women with AD who also received a stable dose of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (Bowen et al., 2015). Basic biological, epidemiological and clinical trial data suggest leuprolide acetate mediates improvement and stabilization of neuropathology and cognitive performance via the modulation of gonadotropin and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone signaling. LUCINDA will enroll 150 women with mild-moderate AD who are receiving a stable dose of donepezil from three study sites in the United States. Cognition and function are the primary outcome measures as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. Blood and MRI biomarkers are also measured to assess hormonal, inflammatory and AD biomarker changes. We present the protocol for LUCINDA and discuss trial innovations and challenges including changes necessitated by the covid-19 pandemic and study drug procurement issues.
