Study Title: Can general exercise training and pelvic floor muscle training be used as an empowering tool among women with endometriosis? Experiences among women with endometriosis participating in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The potential benefit of exercise in alleviating symptoms of endometriosis is unclear. Still, exercise may be used to empower women and manage disease symptoms. The purpose of this study was to explore how regular supervised group- and individual exercise training, including pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), is experienced among women with endometriosis after participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Among 41 women randomized to exercise training for four months, ten women were interviewed about their experiences with exercise training after participation in the trial. The weekly group training was led by women's health physiotherapists and included individualized and progressive muscular strength training of large muscle groups and the pelvic floor muscles, in addition to endurance-, flexibility, and relaxation training. An individual training program followed the same principles as the group training and was to be performed 3-5 times per week, depending on the level of intensity. PFMT was recommended daily. The women also received a group pain management course emphasizing exercise training as self-management. Using inductive reflexive thematic analysis, responses to the question "Did participation in the study change your view of exercise as part of the treatment for endometriosis?" were analyzed. The women brought forward the importance of knowledge about the benefits of exercise to make informed decisions in disease management. Further, the women described how exercise training was perceived as less frightening and manageable when exposed to various intensities, dosages, and types of exercises in a safe and supportive environment. PFMT was especially brought forward as something new and appreciated, and for some of the women, to be performed on days when their bodies could not handle the general exercise training. They also expressed that the supervised exercise brought an extra dimension of belonging through group participation. Individualization and regular supervision seem important to empower women with knowledge about exercise training as self-management and to experience exercise training as safe and non-threatening. Further, creating a sense of belonging through group training may improve social support and build active coping strategies that are essential for disease management of endometriosis.
