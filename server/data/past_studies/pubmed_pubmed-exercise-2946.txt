Study Title: Nutrition guidance within a multimodal intervention improves diet quality in prodromal Alzheimer's disease: Multimodal Preventive Trial for Alzheimer's Disease (MIND-AD).

Study Summary:
Multimodal lifestyle interventions can benefit overall health, including cognition, in populations at-risk for dementia. However, little is known about the effect of lifestyle interventions in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Even less is known about dietary intake and adherence to dietary recommendations within this population making it difficult to design tailored interventions for them. A 6-month MIND-ADpilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted among 93 participants with prodromal AD in Sweden, Finland, Germany, and France. Three arms were included in the RCT: 1) multimodal lifestyle intervention (nutritional guidance, exercise, cognitive training, vascular/metabolic risk management, and social stimulation); 2) multimodal lifestyle intervention&#x2009;+&#x2009;medical food product; and 3) regular health advice (control group). Adherence to dietary advice was assessed with a brief food intake questionnaire by using the Healthy Diet Index (HDI) and Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). The intake of macro- and micronutrients were analyzed on a subsample using 3-day food records. The dietary quality in the intervention groups, pooled together, improved compared to that of the control group at the end of the study, as measured with by HDI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026) and MEDAS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). The lifestyle-only group improved significantly more in MEDAS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046) and almost significantly in HDI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.052) compared to the control group, while the lifestyle&#x2009;+&#x2009;medical food group improved in both HDI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) and MEDAS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) during the study. There were no changes in macro- or micronutrient intake for the intervention groups at follow-up; however, the intakes in the control group declined in several vitamins and minerals when adjusted for energy intake. These results suggest that dietary intervention as part of multimodal lifestyle interventions is feasible and results in improved dietary quality in a population with prodromal AD. Nutrient intakes remained unchanged in the intervention groups while the control group showed a decreasing nutrient density. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03249688, 2017-07-08.
