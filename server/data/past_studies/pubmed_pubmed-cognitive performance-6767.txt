Study Title: The attention-enhancing effects of spearmint extract supplementation in healthy men and women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial.

Study Summary:
Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic supplementation with a proprietary spearmint extract (PSE) can improve cognitive performance in individuals 50-70&#x202f;years of age with age-related memory issues. In the present study, our hypothesis was that chronic supplementation of PSE would improve cognitive performance in young, active individuals. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, healthy, recreationally active men and women (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;142) received 900&#x202f;mg of PSE or placebo (PLA) daily for 90&#x202f;days. Cognition was assessed via cognitive test battery (CNS Vital Signs) that resulted in 10 cognitive domains. Sleep, mood, and quality of life were assessed via validated questionnaires. Measurements were evaluated on days 0, 7, 30, and 90 of supplementation. Significant (P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.05) treatment effects were observed for sustained attention, wherein PSE improved sustained attention vs PLA at day 30 (PSE: 33.3&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.54 vs PLA: 31.2&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.98; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.001) and day 90 (PSE: 34.0&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.44 vs PLA: 32.7&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.75; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.007). Significant (P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.05) treatment &#xd7; visit interactions were observed for complex attention, wherein PSE improved complex attention compared to PLA at day 7 (PSE: 8.0&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;2.22 vs PLA: 7.6&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.57; P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.016). Significant (P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.05) improvements were observed in 2 individual tests: the shifting attention test and the 4-part continuous performance test. No significant differences were observed in mood, sleep, or quality of life. The current study demonstrates that chronic supplementation with 900&#x202f;mg of PSE improves cognitive performance in a young, active population, further supporting PSE as an efficacious nootropic.
