Study Title: Dynamic interplay of cortisol and BDNF in males under acute and chronic psychosocial stress - A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
The neurotrophic protein brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in brain function and is affected by acute and chronic stress. We here investigate the patterns of BDNF and cortisol stress reactivity and recovery under the standardized stress protocol of the TSST and the effect of perceived chronic stress on the basal BDNF levels in healthy young men. Twenty-nine lean young men underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a resting condition. Serum BDNF and cortisol were measured before and repeatedly after both conditions. The perception of chronic stress was assessed by the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS). After the TSST, there was a significant increase over time for BDNF and cortisol. Stronger increase in cortisol in response to stress was linked to an accelerated BDNF decline after stress. Basal resting levels of BDNF was significantly predicted by chronic stress perception. The increased BDNF level following psychosocial stress suggest a stress-induced neuroprotective mechanism. The presumed interplay between BDNF and the HPA-axis indicates an antagonistic relationship of cortisol on BDNF recovery post-stress. Chronically elevated high cortisol levels, as present in chronic stress, could thereby contribute to reduced neurogenesis, and an increased risk of neurodegenerative conditions in persons suffering from chronic stress.
