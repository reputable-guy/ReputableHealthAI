Study Title: The effects of insufficient sleep and adequate sleep on cognitive function in healthy adults.

Study Summary:
Although sleep affects a range of waking behaviors, the majority of studies have focused on sleep loss with relatively little attention on sustained periods of adequate sleep. The goal of this study was to use an experimental design to examine the effect of both of these sleep patterns on cognitive performance in healthy adults. This study used a randomized crossover design. Participants who regularly slept 7-9&#xa0;hours/night completed two 6-week intervention conditions, adequate sleep (maintenance of habitual bed/wake times) and insufficient sleep (reduction in sleep of 1.5&#xa0;hours relative to adequate sleep), separated by a 2-6weeks (median=43days) washout period. Cognitive functioning was evaluated at baseline and endpoint of each intervention using the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. General linear models contrasted scores following each condition to the baseline of the first condition; the baseline of the second condition was included to evaluate practice effects. Sixty-five participants (age 35.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.9years, 89% women, 52% non-White race/ethnicity) completed study procedures. There was improvement in performance on the List Sorting Working Memory task after the adequate sleep condition that exceeded practice effects. Cognitive performance after insufficient sleep did not reach the level expected with practice and did not differ from baseline. A similar pattern was found on the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention task. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between sleep and cognition and demonstrate that consistent, stable sleep of at least 7&#xa0;hours/night improves working memory and response inhibition in healthy adults. The manuscript reports on data from two clinical trials: Impact of Sleep Restriction on Performance in Adults (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02960776, ID Number: NCT02960776) and Impact of Sleep Restriction in Women (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02835261, ID Number: NCT02835261).
