Study Title: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the management of restless legs syndrome symptoms: A single-blind, parallel-group clinical study.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to investigate the additional effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the control of the symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS). A total of 46 randomly selected patients diagnosed with RLS were divided into two groups in a single-blind study to either receive pramipexole (0.25&#x2009;mg daily) plus 10 sessions of TENS or only pramipexole (0.25&#x2009;mg daily) for 4&#x2009;weeks. The severity of the symptoms was determined according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLSRS) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) at the beginning of the treatment, post-treatment, and at an 8 week follow-up. A significant time interaction was observed between the groups for all measurement outcomes, revealing differences in favour of the experimental group's IRLSRS and PSQI scores. A notable improvement was also observed in the IRLSRS and PSQI scores in both groups at the end of treatment and during the 8 week follow-up period. In comparison with pramipexole monotherapy, the results of this study showed that the use of TENS therapy combined with a low dose of pramipexole (0.25&#x2009;mg daily) is therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of RLS over an 8 week follow-up period.
