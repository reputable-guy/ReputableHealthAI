Study Title: Integrative oncology for patients with lung cancer: A prospective pragmatic controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Complementary medicine and integrative oncology modalities (IOM) have been included in the clinical practice guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians in the treatments of patients with lung cancer. The present study examined the impact of a patient-tailored IOM treatment program on quality of life (QoL)-related concerns among patients with non-small and small lung cancer undergoing active oncology treatment. This controlled study was pragmatic and prospective assessing the adherence among patients referred by their oncology healthcare provider to an integrative physician consultation, followed by 6 weekly IOM treatments addressing QoL-related concerns. High adherence to integrative care (high-AIC, vs. low-AIC) was defined as attending &#x2265;4 IOM sessions. Symptoms were assessed using the ESAS (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire), and MYCAW (Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing) tools, at baseline and 6&#xa0;weeks. Of 153 patients, 74 (48&#xa0;%) were high-AIC, with baseline demographic, cancer-and QoL-related characteristics similar to those of low-AIC patients. At 6&#xa0;weeks, high-AIC patients reported greater improvement on MYCAW well-being (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036), with within-group improvement observed for EORTC pain (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.021) and emotional functioning (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.041); and for ESAS depression (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005), with borderline significance for EORTC sleep (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.06). High adherence to a 6-week IOM program within supportive/palliative care for patients with lung cancer was found to alleviate pain and emotional concerns, improving overall QoL. Further research is needed to confirm the findings in real-life IOM practice for patients with lung cancer.
