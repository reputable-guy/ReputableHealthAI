Study Title: Effects of an ice roller on chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus in patients receiving haemodialysis.

Study Summary:
Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus is a distressing symptom and has a far-reaching impact on patients' sleep and quality of life for most patients receiving haemodialysis. Traditional therapies have limited effectiveness. This study aimed to invent a self-operated ice roller and evaluate its efficacy in relieving pruritus, sleep quality, and quality of life. This study was experimental with a two-arm parallel group design. A convenient sampling method was used to recruit 60 patients receiving haemodialysis who reported pruritus (5D-Itch Scale score >5) lasting over 4 weeks in Taiwan. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the intervention group used an ice roller for 7 days, while the control group received no anti-pruritus treatment. This study was experimental with a two-arm parallel group design. The measurement instruments included the 5D-Itch Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and WHOQOL-BREF-Taiwan Version. The analysis of covariance, chi-square, Independent t tests,&#xa0;and partial Eta(&#x3b7;p) were used to analyse the data. The participants' mean age was 62.77 years. Application of the ice roller significantly decreased overall pruritus (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05; &#x3b7;p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.09) and distribution of pruritus-associated bodily parts (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03; &#x3b7;p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.08). There were no statistically significant differences in sleep quality and related indicators between the experimental and control groups at the study endpoint. Regarding quality of life, only the social relationship domain significantly differed between the two groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02; &#x3b7;p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.08). The ice roller can decrease pruritus and its distribution in patients receiving haemodialysis, serving as an adjunct therapy alongside conventional anti-pruritus treatments.
