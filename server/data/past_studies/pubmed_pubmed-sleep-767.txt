Study Title: The effect of lavender and bergamot oil applied via inhalation on the anxiety level and sleep quality of surgical intensive care unit patients.

Study Summary:
Due to numerous stressors in intensive care, common psychosocial problems arise in patients. Among these, decreased anxiety and sleep quality are observed. This study aims to determine the effect of lavender and bergamot oil applied by inhalation on anxiety and sleep quality in surgical intensive care unit patients. Fifty-four patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, were included in this study. They were randomly divided into three groups (Lavender, Bergamot, Control). Intervention groups were exposed to 3 drops of lavender oil or bergamot oil on pillows for 20 min, which were then placed 10 cm away from the patient's head. This intervention was applied for two nights. The patients' sleep quality and anxiety level were evaluated using the "State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)" and "Richard-Campbell Sleep Scale (RCSS)." Data were analyzed using Chi-square, independent t-test, One-way ANOVA tests. According to our results, anxiety scores significantly decreased in the lavender and bergamot groups. Sleep quality scores significantly increased (p = <0.001). The control group showed lower sleep quality scores. Lavender and bergamot oil inhalation appeared effective in reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality in surgical intensive care unit patients.
