Study Title: Exploring Effects of Aerobic Exercise and Mindfulness Training on Cognitive Function in Older Adults at Risk of Dementia: A Feasibility, Proof-of-Concept Study.

Study Summary:
This study sought to explore feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of aerobic training (AT), mindfulness training (MT), or both (MT + AT) on cognitive function in older individuals at risk of dementia. Participants were randomized to AT, MT, both, or usual care (UC). Z-scores of attention, verbal fluency, and episodic memory for non-demented adults (ZAVEN) were computed at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and 6&#xa0;months since baseline. Of the 36 enrolled participants (12&#xa0;M, 24&#xa0;F, mean age = 70.1&#xa0;years), 97% were retained in the study at 6&#xa0;months. At EOT, MT had higher ZAVEN scores than UC (b = .43, P =.03) and AT (b = .26, P = .10), while no differences were seen with MT + AT. A similar pattern was observed at a 6&#xa0;month follow-up (allvalues = .10). MT may improve cognitive function in older individuals at risk of dementia. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed in a fully powered RCT.
