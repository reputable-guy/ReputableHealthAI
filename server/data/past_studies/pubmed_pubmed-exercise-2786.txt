Study Title: Does combining two evidence-based exercise programs in elderly people with incontinence have a triple effect on incontinence symptoms, balance and functional status?

Study Summary:
Improving pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), balance and functional activity is recommended in the treatment of urinary incontinence (UI) in the elderly people. The aim of this study is to examine whether PFMT combined with Otago exercises is effective on symptoms, balance and functional status in elderly people with UI compared to PFMT alone. This study is an assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants with UI aged 65 and over living in a nursing home were randomly assigned to the intervention (IG) and control groups (CG). The intervention group attended an exercise program that included Otago exercises combined with PFMT. The control group was included in the PFMT program with different positions. The duration of exercise for both groups was 45-60&#xa0;min per session three times a week for 12&#xa0;weeks. UI symptoms and severity (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20, bladder diary), PFM muscle function (superficial electromyography), balance (Berg Balance Scale), functional status (Senior Fitness Test) and fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale) were measured at baseline and after the intervention. The median age of the IG (n: 22) and CG (n: 21) was 73.5 and 77&#xa0;years, respectively. At baseline and after the intervention within the group, a significant improvement was observed in the PTDE-20 score (IG and CG, p: 0.00) and the 2-min step test in the IG (p: 0.02) and CG (p: 0.01). A significant decrease was found in the 2.45&#xa0;m get up-and-go test, PFM work average onset, and PFM rest MVC EMG values (p: 0.01, p: 0.01, p: 0.00) in the IG. The PFM rest average value decreased (p: 0.04) in the CG. The findings of this study show that combining PFMT with Otago exercises, two evidence-based interventions, is beneficial for effectively treating incontinence symptoms, balance and functional status in elderly people. Thus, a triple effect can be achieved with a single exercise training in the same treatment session and for the same duration. Clinical trial number: NCT06331039.
