Study Title: Student support services: Perceptions and recommendations for the next generation.

Study Summary:
Student support services/student affairs are central to the student academic experience and success at US and Canadian dental schools. This manuscript evaluates student and administrator perceptions of support services and offers recommendations for best practices in student services in predoctoral dental education to help institutions improve the student experience. A survey of administrators and dental students found perceptions of student support services vary between these groups. Seventeen student services administrators and 263 students started the survey, and 12 administrators and 156 students completed the full survey. Survey comments indicated access to student support services is a concern. Results of the student survey, in conjunction with current literature, were utilized to develop recommendations for dental student support services. Recommendations for student support services in dental schools include accessibility of student services, and ensuring students have access to support in the domains of wellness, academic support, and peer support as well as implementation of humanistic practices. Wellness supports should include behavioral health services, physical health services, and access to mindfulness interventions. Academic support services should include study skills, time management training, and academic supports such as tutoring. Structured peer support programs should also be implemented. Dental schools should also be mindful of the changing support needs of incoming dental students.
