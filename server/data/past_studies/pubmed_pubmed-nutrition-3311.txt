Study Title: The Feasibility and Efficacy of Warrior Health and Fitness: A 3-Month Fitness and Nutrition Program for Veterans.

Study Summary:
Veterans are at risk for mental and physical health problems but may not seek traditional health care services. Wellness-based interventions, including exercise and nutrition, have been associated with improvements in physical and mental health among this population. This study explores the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a 3-month health and fitness program for veterans. Participants in 2 time-based cohorts from 2019 to 2023 (cohort 1: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;261; cohort 2: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;256) were cleared by a physician to participate. Participants then completed a fitness test and self-reported surveys (e.g., quality of life, sleep, and pain) before and after the 3-month program. Participants were recruited to participate at one of three sites: Boston, MA Fort Myers, FL, or Tampa, FL. The 3-month program consisted of weekly, supervised group fitness and one-on-one sessions, nutritional consultations, yoga, and other wellness activities. Primary program outcomes were measured by fitness assessments, self-report surveys, program completion, and program satisfaction. Fitness assessments included measures of weight, body mass index, grip strength, waist to hip ratio, body fat, lean mass, fat mass, heart rate, and blood pressure (BP). Self-report measures included quality of life, depression, loneliness, sleep quality, pain intensity, and pain interference. In cohort 1, significant improvements were found for measures of weight (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01), left-handed grip strength (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.01), body fat percent (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.01), and quality of life (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.01). In cohort 2, significant improvements were found for measures of waist:hip ratio (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02), right and left-handed grip strength (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.01), body mass index (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02), body fat percent (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.01), and quality of life (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02). For both cohorts, pain intensity (cohort 1: P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01, cohort 2: P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) and pain interference (cohort 1: P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02, cohort 2: P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) increased significantly. These data suggest that a 3-month health and fitness program for veterans is acceptable and feasible and may improve physical and mental health outcomes. Considerations for program retention and assessment completion are discussed.
