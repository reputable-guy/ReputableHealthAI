Study Title: A multicomponent personalized prevention program in the primary care setting: a randomized clinical trial in older people with noncommunicable chronic diseases (Primacare_P3 study).

Study Summary:
Multicomponent interventions based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) could promote active aging and improve health status in older people with Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases (NCDs), but conflicting evidences are available. To evaluate the efficacy of a CGA-based multicomponent personalized preventive program (PPP) in reducing unplanned hospitalization rates during 12-month follow-up in community-dwelling older people with NCDs. In this randomized clinical trial (RCT), 1216 older adults recruited by 33 general practitioners (GPs) will be randomly allocated to intervention group (IG) or usual care control group (CG). The IG will receive a multicomponent PPP developed on the findings of the CGA-based Multidimensional Prognostic Index short-form (Brief-MPI), including structured interventions to improve functional, physical, cognitive, and nutritional status, to monitor NCDs and vaccinations, and to prevent social isolation. Participants in the CG will receive usual care. Brief-MPI, resilience, and health-related quality of life will be assessed after 6 and 12&#xa0;months. Moreover, saliva samples will be collected at baseline in IG to measure biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and oral microbiome. The CGA-based PPP might reduce unplanned hospitalization rates and potentially institutionalization rates, emergency department (ED) and unplanned GP visits, and mortality. Further outcomes explored in the IG will be the adherence to PPP, resilience, health-related quality of life, and multidimensional frailty as assessed by the Brief-MPI. Results will suggest whether the CGA-based multicomponent PPP is able to improve specific outcomes in a primary care setting.
