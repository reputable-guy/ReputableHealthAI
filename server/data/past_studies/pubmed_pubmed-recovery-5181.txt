Study Title: An open comparative randomized prospective study: Direct trocar insertion vs Veress needle technique in laparoscopic surgeries.

Study Summary:
Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive technique utilized for both diagnostic and surgical approaches. Minimally invasive procedures compared to laparotomy offer the advantages of reduced hospital stay, lower morbidity, decreased pain, and faster recovery. Common methods for laparoscopic entry include Veress needle insertion (VNI), direct optical trocar entry, direct trocar insertion (DTI), and the Hasson technique. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of VNI and DTI in laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. An open comparative randomized prospective study was conducted involving 200 women aged 18 to 70 years, scheduled for laparoscopic surgery at 2 tertiary centers. Participants were randomized into 2 groups: 1 using VNI and other using DTI. The groups were homogeneous regarding age, parity, and body mass index. The mean age of the VNI group is 45.22&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;11.65 and the DTI group is 44.89&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;10.5 (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.833). There were no statistical significance in terms of the presence of chronic diseases and history of previous abdominal surgery between the groups (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.802 and P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.510, respectively). Entry time to the abdomen, the decrease in hemoglobin values, and hospitalization length were found to be statistically significant between the entry methods (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.002, and P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001, respectively). Entry time, the decrease in hemoglobin value, and hospitalization length were higher in the VNI group. In conclusion, although there is no definitive consensus on the optimal laparoscopic entry technique, direct trocar entry is an effective alternative to the Veress needle insertion technique. Direct trocar entry is associated with shorter entry times, fewer perioperative complications, less reduction in hemoglobin levels, and shorter hospitalization duration compared to VNI.
