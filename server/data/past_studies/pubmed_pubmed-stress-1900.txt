Study Title: The Effect of Distance Reiki on State Test Anxiety and Test Performance: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Nursing Students.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled, pretest-post-test intervention study examined the effect of distance reiki on state test anxiety and test performance. First-year nursing students (= 71) were randomized into two groups. One week before the examination, intervention group participants performed reiki remotely for 20 minutes for 4 consecutive days, and control group participants received no intervention. The intervention group had lower posttest cognitive and psychosocial subscale scores than pretest scores (> .05). The control group had a significantly higher mean posttest physiological subscale score than pretest score (< .05). Final grade point averages were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups (> .05). One quarter of the intervention group participants noted reiki reduced their stress and helped them perform better on the examination. Reiki is a safe and easy-to-practice method to help students cope with test anxiety..
