Study Title: Nurse-Guided Maternal Interventional Package for Neonatal Stress - A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the role of nurse-guided maternal interventional package for reducing stress behaviour among preterm neonates admitted in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 100 mothers and their newborns delivered preterm and admitted consecutively in the NICU over 4 months. Mothers in the intervention group (n = 50) received education and demonstration regarding the use of maternal touch, facilitated tucking, kangaroo mother care (KMC), non-nutritive sucking (NNS), nesting and maternal voice alongwith a handout in local language for five consecutive days, while those in the control group (n = 50) received routine care including KMC and NNS for five consecutive days. Neonates were assessed before and five days after enrolment or intervention by using modified Infant Positioning Assessment Tool (IPAT), Neonatal Stress Scale and Preterm Neonate's Behaviour Assessment Scale. The mean (SD) score of positioning was significantly higher in the intervention group as compared to control group [9.62 (1.17) vs 6.58 (1.72), P < 0.001]. The median (IQR) score of stress was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group [7 (7,10) vs 11(8,12.75), P = 0.004]. The mean (SD) scores for the autonomic and visceral subsystem behavioral response were significantly higher in the intervention group [5.28 (1.4) vs 3.25 (1.0), P < 0.001]. Mean (SD) attention interaction subsystem behavioral response score in the intervention group was significantly higher compared to the control group [2.96 (1.2) vs 1.85 (0.9), P = 0.001]. Mothers can be guided by nurses on neonatal stress behaviour and how to handle neonates in NICU, which significantly improves positioning and behavioral scores and reduces stress scores.
