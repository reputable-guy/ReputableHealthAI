Study Title: Implementation of Well-Being for Cardiothoracic Surgeons.

Study Summary:
Well-being is a quality of positive physical, mental, social, and environmental experiences. Well-being enables thoracic surgeons to achieve their full potential across personal and work domains. Evidence-based guidelines to promote individual well-being include (1) progress toward a goal; (2) actions commensurate with experience, interest, mission; (3) interconnectivity with others; (4) social relatedness of the work one does; (5) safety; and (6) autonomy. Successful pursuit of well-being includes the development of individual skills of mindfulness, resilience, and connection with others. However, well-being among individuals cannot be achieved without support of workplace leaders and durable institutional infrastructure.
