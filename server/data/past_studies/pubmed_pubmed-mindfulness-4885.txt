Study Title: The Development, Implementation, and Preliminary Outcomes of a 5-Minute Mindfulness Program to Improve Well-Being and Increase Connection Across a University Campus.

Study Summary:
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, people worldwide have experienced increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness and decreased well-being. Mindfulness has been shown to enhance well-being across a variety of settings and for a variety of populations. We developed and implemented a digital mindfulness program called Mindful Moment across a US university system as an innovative wellness resource to facilitate well-being and sense of connection among faculty, staff, and students. Attendees engaged in 5-minute live guided mindfulness sessions twice per week. This paper outlines our program evaluation over the course of four&#xa0;months. A total of 236 individuals attended between one to 30 mindful moment sessions. Data were collected on attendance, perception of the program's impact on attendee well-being and connectedness to the community, and feedback for future program development. Data collection included standardized stress and belongingness measures in addition to qualitative data related to perceived impact and reasons for attending. Students, faculty, and staff who attended Mindful Moment and completed surveys reported that the program was easy to access, noted immediate benefits including decreased stress and improved well-being, and some attendees reported increased feelings of connection with the community. The present paper is exploratory in nature, a first step to assessing feasibility and overall impact. Future research assessing the impact of digital mindfulness programs can be improved by including a comparison group, additional standardized assessment, and a pre-post design, allowing for stronger conclusions to be drawn regarding efficacy and generalizability.
