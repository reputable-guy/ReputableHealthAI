Study Title: Statin therapy improves locomotor muscle microvascular reactivity in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Study Summary:
Peripheral microvascular dysfunction has been documented in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which may be related to elevated levels of inflammation and oxidative stress. Unfortunately, few strategies have been identified to effectively ameliorate this disease-related derangement. Thus, using a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this study evaluated the efficacy of 30-day atorvastatin administration (10 mg daily) on lower limb microvascular reactivity, functional capacity, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with HFpEF (statin,= 8, 76&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6 yr; placebo,= 8, 68&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9 yr). The passive limb movement (PLM)-induced hyperemic response and 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance were evaluated to assess ambulatory muscle microvascular function and functional capacity, respectively. Circulating biomarkers were also measured to assess the contribution of changes in inflammation and redox balance to these outcomes. The total hyperemic response to PLM, assessed as leg blood flow area under the curve (LBF), increased following the statin intervention (pre, 60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;68 mL; post, 164&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;90 mL;< 0.01), whereas these variables were unchanged in the placebo group (= 0.99). There were no significant differences in 6MWT distance following statin or placebo intervention. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, was significantly reduced following the statin intervention (pre, 0.68&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.10; post, 0.51&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.11;< 0.01) while other circulating biomarkers were unchanged. Together, these data provide new evidence for the efficacy of low-dose statin administration to improve locomotor muscle microvascular reactivity in patients with HFpEF, which may be due, in part, to a diminution in oxidative stress.This was the first study to investigate the impact of statin administration on locomotor muscle microvascular function in patients with HFpEF. In support of our hypothesis, the total hyperemic response to PLM, assessed as leg blood flow area under the curve, increased, and malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative damage, was reduced following the statin intervention. Together, these data provide new evidence for the efficacy of statin administration to improve locomotor muscle microvascular reactivity in patients with HFpEF, which may be due, in part, to reduced oxidative stress.
