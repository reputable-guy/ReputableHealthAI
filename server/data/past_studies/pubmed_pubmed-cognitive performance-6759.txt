Study Title: Brain structural changes after multi-strategic metamemory training in older adults with subjective memory complaints: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Metamemory is the process of monitoring and controlling one's memory. Improving metamemory may reduce the memory problem in old age. We hypothesized that metamemory training (MMT) would improve cognition in older adults with subjective memory complaints and change the brain region related to metacognition. We recruited and randomized older adults to the multi-strategic memory training of 10 weekly 90-min sessions, based on the metamemory concept or usual care. Cognitive tests including the Elderly Verbal Learning Test, Simple Rey Figure Test, Digit Span, Spatial Span, Categorical Fluency, and the Boston Naming Test were done in 201 participants, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 49 participants before and after training. A total of 112 in the training group and 89 in the control group participated. The training group had a significant increase in long-term delayed free recall, categorical fluency, and the Boston Naming test. In MRI, the mean diffusivity of the bundles of axon tracts passing from the frontal lobe to the posterior end of the lateral sulcus decreased in the training group. These results indicate that the MMT program has a positive impact on enhancing older people' cognitive performance. Improved white matter integrity in the anterior and posterior cerebrum and increased cortical thickness of prefrontal regions, which related to metacognition, possibly suggest that the effects of the MMT would be induced via the enhancement of cognitive control.
