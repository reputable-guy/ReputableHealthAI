Study Title: A study on the effect of clinical intervention of evidence-based nursing measures on complications in patients after breast-conserving surgery.

Study Summary:
Breast-conserving surgery is an important treatment for breast cancer, which not only eradicates the disease, but also protects the integrity of the breast, however, postoperative nausea and vomiting often bother patients. This study examines the effects of evidence-based nursing practices on nausea and vomiting in patients after breast-conserving surgery, with the aim of providing new perspectives for clinical nursing practice. One hundred and sixty patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery from January 2023 to December 2023 in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center were enrolled. The patients were divided into an intervention group (evidence-based nursing group) and a control group (conventional nursing group) using the random number table method, both groups comprised 80 patients. The control group used conventional nursing methods, and the intervention group added evidence-based nursing intervention on this basis. Comparative analysis focused on the incidence of nausea and vomiting, quality of life metrics, and postoperative satisfaction. In the intervention group, notably lower incidence rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting were observed compared to the control group within both the 0-24 hour and 24-48-hour postoperative periods (P< 0.05). Furthermore, the intervention group exhibited significantly higher scores across all five dimensions as well as the overall score of the FACT-B scale in comparison to the control group (P< 0.05), accompanied by heightened satisfaction with the nursing staff. This study demonstrated the positive clinical intervention effects of evidence-based nursing measures and emphasized their importance in improving postoperative nausea and vomiting and quality of life. Future studies are expected to incorporate evidence-based nursing practices into nursing care to improve patient recovery and overall quality of care.
