Study Title: Bioactive Exploration in Functional Foods: Unlocking Nature's Treasures.

Study Summary:
Functional foods offer an appealing way to improve health and prevent chronic diseases, and this subject has received much attention lately. They are effective in preventing chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, according to research. This work presents an in-depth analysis of functional foods, covering key challenges from a scientific, legal, and commercial perspective. Multiple databases were searched to find studies on functional foods included in the systematic literature review. Various aspects of functional foods, from their classification, impact on human wellness, effectiveness in inhibiting chronic diseases, the regulatory environment, global market trends, and industry challenges, are all clarified in this thorough review. This study aims to enhance understanding and establish a pathway for functional foods to be acknowledged as valid choices in the field of dietary supplements. It provides a thorough investigation of bioactive compounds present in functional foods, including but not limited to polyphenols, carotenoids, omega fatty acids, prebiotics, probiotics, and dietary fiber, along with an overview of their potential to mitigate chronic illnesses. We engage in an in-depth exploration of regulatory frameworks, shed light on groundbreaking research advancements, and meticulously examine strategies for commercialization and the variety of global challenges that accompany them. Establishing scientific consensus, navigating complex regulatory processes, dealing with skeptical consumers, and rising levels of competition are all problems that need to be solved in this field. The field of functional foods can advance further, promoting better public health outcomes, by deeply comprehending and addressing these complex dimensions.
