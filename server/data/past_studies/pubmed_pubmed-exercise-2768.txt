Study Title: Efficacy of hip abductors exercise training combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on knee osteoarthritis: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Knee osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease where a single treatment method often fails to fully alleviate symptoms. Hence, finding effective non-invasive combined treatment approaches is particularly crucial. The efficacy of treating knee osteoarthritis with hip abductors exercise training combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was assessed through functional scales and objective evaluation methods. In this four-week randomized clinical trial, 160 patients meeting inclusion criteria were randomly assigned 1:1 to group A to receive oral celecoxib and group B to receive a combination of hip abductors exercise training and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation. The primary outcome was the western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index. The secondary outcomes include Visual Analogue Scale, knee outcome survey activities of daily living scale, Active Range of Motion, and the Quadriceps Angle, the tibiofemoral angle, peak adductor moment, the integrated electromyography and root mean square of the surface electromyography of the lower extremity muscles. Paired sample t test was used for Within-Group comparison of outcome indicators, and independent sample t test was used for Between-Group comparison. Of the 160 randomly assigned patients, 150 completed the study. After 4 weeks, the WOMAC index decreased from 61 &#xb1; 10.83 to 40.55 &#xb1; 7.58 in the combined treatment group and from 60.97 &#xb1; 10.18 to 47.7 &#xb1; 10.13 in the celecoxib group. The effect of the combined treatment group was significantly higher than that in the celecoxib group (P< 0.001). In the combined treatment group, the score of knee joint daily living scale increased (P< 0.001), the active range of motion increased (P< 0.001), the quadriceps angle decreased (P< 0.001), the tibiofemoral angle increased (P< 0.001), and the peak adduction moment decreased (P< 0.001), integrated electromyography and root mean square increased (P< 0.001), and the effect was better than that of celecoxib group (P< 0.001). The visual analog scale score in celecoxib group was lower (P< 0.001) and knee outcome survey activities of daily living scale was higher (P< 0.001). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 10% in the celecoxib group and 2.5% in the combined treatment group, all of which were mild. Hip abductors exercise training combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can enhance abduction muscle strength, improve mobility, reduce joint pain, and enhance quality of life. This combined approach shows superior clinical effectiveness compared to oral celecoxib.
