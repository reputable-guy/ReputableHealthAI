Study Title: Maternal mood, anxiety and mental health functioning after combined myo-inositol, probiotics, micronutrient supplementation from preconception: Findings from the NiPPeR RCT.

Study Summary:
Observational studies have reported associations between nutrition during pregnancy and mental wellbeing. As secondary outcomes, the NiPPeR double-blind randomized trial in women planning conception investigated whether a myo-inositol, probiotics and enriched micronutrients formulation (intervention) taken preconception and throughout pregnancy could improve mental wellbeing during pregnancy and post-delivery, compared with a standard micronutrient supplement (control). Mood and anxiety symptoms were ascertained (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-state)) at preconception (baseline), 7, 28 and 34 weeks gestation, 3-weeks and 6-months post-delivery. EPDS>=13 was categorised as low mood; STAI-state>=45 as high anxiety. Change in mental health functioning was assessed as difference between preconception baseline and 6-month post-delivery 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12v2) mental component scores. Adjusting for site, ethnicity and baseline scores, there were no robust differences in EPDS and STAI-state scores between intervention and control groups across pregnancy (n = 630) and post-delivery (n = 532). Compared to controls, intervention group women averaged a 1.21 (95 %CI 0.04,2.39) higher change in SF-12v2 mental component score from preconception to 6-months post-delivery. Taking a myo-inositol, micronutrient and probiotic supplement during preconception/pregnancy had no effect on mood and anxiety, but there was evidence of a modest improvement in mental health functioning from preconception to 6-months post-delivery.
