Study Title: Recovery effect of self-myofascial release treatment using different type of a foam rollers.

Study Summary:
Among athletes, foam rolling is popular technique of myofascial release aimed to support recovery processes and counteract delayed onset muscle soreness. However, there is no consensus on the optimal parameters of the roller texture used in the procedure. The study aimed to determine whether using rollers with different textures and hardness (smooth/soft, grooved/mid, serrated/hard) in myofascial release affects post-exertional restitution rate and the level of perceived DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) after intense anaerobic exercise. The study involved 60 healthy and physically active men randomly divided into three experimental groups and one control group (passive rest)-each consisting of 15 individuals: STH-rolling with a smooth roller; G-rolling with a grooved roller; TP-rolling with a serrated roller; Pass-passive rest group. After performing a exercise test (one-minute high-intensity squat), blood lactate (LA), creatine kinase (CK) and pain perception (VAS Scale) were monitored. The analysis of the average LA concentration in the blood 30&#xa0;min post-exercise showed a statistical difference for all rolling groups compared to the passive rest group: STH (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), G (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), TP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035). No statistically significant differences were found between the CK measurement results in individual assessments. Statistically significant differences in VAS values were observed between G (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and TP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006) groups and the Pass group at 48&#xa0;h, as well as between STH (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003); G (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001); TP (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) groups and the Pass group at 72&#xa0;h. Based on statistical data, a strong influence (&#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.578) of time on the quadriceps VAS variable was noted. The research results confirm the effectiveness of rolling in supporting immediate and prolonged recovery. The conducted studies indicate a significantly better pace of post-exertional recovery after a rolling procedure lasting at least 120&#xa0;s. The texture and hardness of the tool used did not matter with such a duration of the treatment.
