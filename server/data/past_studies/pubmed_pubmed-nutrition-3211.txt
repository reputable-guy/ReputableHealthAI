Study Title: Feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an online nutrition education intervention for those with a sleeve gastrectomy: A pilot randomised control trial.

Study Summary:
A sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a lifelong treatment that improves health and better outcomes are associated with follow-up. However, there is lack of access or high attrition to aftercare. This potentially contributes to sub-optimal dietary intake and a lack of evidence for nutrition interventions. The present study assessed the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a nutrition intervention to improve diet quality in Australian adults living with a SG. Adults (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;96) post-SG were recruited into a cross-sectional diet quality study, with 68 eligible for randomisation to an intervention or wait-list control group. Over 10 weeks, a Facebook group was used to post daily nutrition education. Feasibility outcomes included participant recruitment, engagement, retention and acceptability. Preliminary efficacy was assessed using change in Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS). Linear mixed models were used to measure differences in mean outcome between the experimental groups over time. Sixty-eight participants (97% female) aged 48.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.8 years, body mass index 33.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.8 kg/m, and mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD ARFS 39&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9 points were randomised to the intervention, with 66% retention at 10 weeks. At follow-up, diet quality increased for the intervention group (mean ARFS, 95% confidence interval = 0.2 [-1.5 to 1.9]) and decreased for the control group (mean ARFS, 95% confidence interval= -2.0 [-5.2 to 1.2]) with no between group difference (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2). Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) rated the intervention positively. Recruiting and retaining adults post-SG into a nutrition intervention is feasible. Low-cost recruitment attracted strong interest from women to identify greater support to know what to eat following SG. A future fully powered trial to assess intervention efficacy is warranted.
