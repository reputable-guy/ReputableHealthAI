Study Title: Effects of photobiomodulation applied at different times on functional performance and ergogenic response of rugby athletes: Randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Photobiomodulation (PBM) is indicated to accelerate the recovery of athletes and reduce muscle damage caused by physical exercise. The objective of this study was to establish the best time to apply photobiomodulation to increase the functional performance and ergogenic response of rugby athletes. Randomized crossover clinical trial with 18 rugby athletes of both sexes. The interventions were carried out from January to May 2019. The blood levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate, and performance in the Modified Star Excursion Balance Test, Single Hop Test, Triple Hop Test, Bangsbo Sprint test (BST), and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 (YoyoIR1) were evaluated. The athletes underwent two blocks of exercises with the BST and Yoyo-IR1, as well as the random application of four interventions: without application of photobiomodulation (CO), pre-exercise photobiomodulation (PBpre), PBM during the exercise interval (PBint), or post-exercise photobiomodulation (PBpos). The photobiomodulation using light-emitting diodes (850&#xa0;nm, 8&#xa0;J/cm) lasted 10&#xa0;min and was applied to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and triceps surae muscles. The results were compared between groups and times, and the effect size for the interventions was established. No differences were found between groups in CK, lactate, and performance in the functional tests between groups and times. Only the PBpre presented improved performance in the first Yoyo-1R1 test (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01), while the PBint improved in the second Yoyo-IR1 test and BST (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The PBM did not change muscle damage markers or performance in the functional tests. For an ergogenic response, photobiomodulation applied before exercise improves performance, which can be maintained when PBM is performed in the exercise interval.
