Study Title: Effects of ganaxolone on non-seizure outcomes in CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder: Double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial.

Study Summary:
CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Ganaxolone, a neuroactive steroid, reduces the frequency of major motor seizures in children with CDD. This analysis explored the effect of ganaxolone on non-seizure outcomes. Children (2-19 years) with genetically confirmed CDD and&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;16 major motor seizures per month were enrolled in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Ganaxolone or placebo was administered three times daily for 17 weeks. Behaviour was measured with the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS), daytime sleepiness with the Child Health Sleep Questionnaire, and quality of life with the Quality of Life Inventory-Disability (QI-Disability) scale. Scores were compared using ANOVA, adjusted for age, sex, number of anti-seizure mediations, baseline 28-day major motor seizure frequency, baseline developmental skills, and behaviour, sleep or quality of life scores. 101 children with CDD (39 clinical sites, 8 countries) were randomized. Median (IQR) age was 6 (3-10) years, 79.2&#xa0;% were female, and 50 received ganaxolone. After 17 weeks of treatment, Manic/Hyperactive scores (mean difference 1.27, 95%CI -2.38,-0.16) and Compulsive Behaviour scores (mean difference 0.58, 95%CI -1.14,-0.01) were lower (improved) in the ganaxolone group compared with the placebo group. Daytime sleepiness scores were similar between groups. The total change in QOL score for children in the ganaxolone group was 2.6 points (95%CI -1.74,7.02) higher (improved) than in the placebo group but without statistical significance. Along with better seizure control, children who received ganaxolone had improved behavioural scores in select domains compared to placebo.
