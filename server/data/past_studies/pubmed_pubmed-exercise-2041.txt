Study Title: Effect of Caloric Restriction and Aerobic Exercise on Premenstrual Syndrome, Anthropometric, and Hormonal Parameters in Obese Females: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects physical, psychological, and behavioral symptoms in women. Obesity may worsen PMS, but the impact of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise on PMS in obese women is unclear. This study examines their effects on PMS, anthropometric, and hormonal parameters in obese females. This randomized controlled trial involved 40 obese females with PMS. They were randomly divided into two groups of 20 each. The control group (A) received medical treatment in the form of Brufen 400&#xa0;mg: one tablet daily for 5&#xa0;days before menstruation and two tablets daily during menstruation for 12&#xa0;weeks. The study group (B) received the same medical treatment and additionally engaged in a program of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise for 12&#xa0;weeks. Outcome measures included the premenstrual syndrome scale (PMSS), weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, waist-hip (W/H) ratio, and serum levels of progesterone and cortisol. At baseline, no significant between-group differences were observed in PMSS scores, anthropometric measures (weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, W/H ratio), or hormonal parameters (serum cortisol and progesterone). Post-treatment, the study group (B) demonstrated significantly greater improvements compared to the control group (A), including reductions in PMSS scores, weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, W/H ratio, and serum cortisol, along with significantly higher serum progesterone levels (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). A 12-week program of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise resulted in substantial improvements in PMS symptoms, anthropometric parameters, cortisol levels, and progesterone levels in obese females with PMS.
