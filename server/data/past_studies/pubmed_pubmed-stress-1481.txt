Study Title: A new video laryngoscope combined with flexible laryngeal mask insertion: A prospective randomized study.

Study Summary:
The video laryngoscope (VLS) has been proven to be an effective insertion device for airway management. However, no laryngoscope has been specifically designed for the placement of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). We improved the current VLS and developed a novel VLS method. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an improved VLS for inserting a flexible laryngeal mask airway (F-LMA) compared with the standard blind method. One hundred and fifty-seven patients who underwent F-LMA insertion under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the standard blind insertion technique (group B) or VLS -assisted insertion (group VL). First attempt success rates were recorded. Secondary outcomes included oropharyngeal leakage pressure (OLP), fiberoptic view, insertion time, position adjustment, reinsertion rate, and postoperative airway morbidity. The first-attempt success rate was higher in group VL than that in group B (99% vs. 86%; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). The OLP was significantly higher in the VLS-guided technique (26.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.1 vs 23.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.4 cmHO, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). The fiberoptic view was significantly better in the group VL (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and required less readjustment and reinsertion to establish an effective airway (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). The insertion time was shorter in the group B than that in group VL (33.9 vs 41.3&#xa0;s, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Hemodynamic stress responses and postoperative airway complications did not differ between the two groups. The new VLS-guided insertion technology has a high success rate, achieves greater OLP, and provides an ideal anatomical position with minimal adjustment, without increasing the risk of hemodynamic stress or adverse events.
