Study Title: Evaluation of Mindfulness Training Combined with Aerobic Exercise on Neurological Function and Quality of Life in Patients with Peripheral Neuropathy Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of mindfulness training on neurological function and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy. This study selected 120 patients with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy and randomly divided them into three independent subgroups according to different training methods: mindfulness meditation group (MM), aerobic exercise group (AE), and mindfulness combined with aerobic exercise group. (MMAE). The three groups were analyzed for SNCV and MNCV velocities, MAAS and TCSS scores, neurological symptom scores, neurological sign scores, and quality of life. Before treatment, SNCV and MNCV were not significantly significant (> 0.05), but after treatment, SNCV and MNCV were significantly higher, and the MMAE group changed more significantly (< 0.05); before treatment, MAAS and TCSS scores were not significant (> 0.05), but after treatment, MAAS scores were significantly higher, TCSS scores were significantly lower, and more significantly in MMAE; the difference was significant (< 0.05); before treatment, there was no statistical significance of the neurological signs score (> 0.05); after treatment, the neurological symptoms score and neurological signs score were significantly reduced, and the changes in the MMAE group were statistically significant (< 0.05); there was no significant difference in the quality of life score before treatment (> 0.05), and the quality of life score in the MMAE group was significantly increased (< 0.05). Mindfulness training combined with aerobic exercise has an ideal therapeutic effect on patients with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and has a very important role in improving the neurological function and quality of life of the patients. It is a safe and effective treatment method. Therefore, mindfulness training combined with aerobic exercise is worthy of promotion and application.
