Study Title: Systemic acupuncture application does not change muscle performance parameters in women: A randomized, controlled, double-blind pilot study.

Study Summary:
Acupuncture is used for therapeutic purposes. The possible beneficial role of this therapy may be as an ergogenic resource for the performance of fitness variables in exercise and sports. To date, acupuncture has been associated with increases in muscle strength, aerobic power, and vertical jump performance, but the evidence is still inconclusive. This study aimed to verify the immediate effects of a single session of acupuncture on lower-limb muscle performance in 31 young, physically active women. This randomized, controlled, double-blind pilot study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee and in the Brazilian Registry of Randomized Clinical Trials. After warming up on a treadmill, the participants underwent the vertical jump test, followed by an isometric strength test of the extensor muscles of both knees. Immediately after the tests, participants were randomly divided into the following groups: sham (SG), acupuncture (AG), and control (CG). After each intervention, all participants repeated the warm-up and functional tests. There was a significant decrease in the mean and peak values of vertical jump height, in the sham and acupuncture groups, respectively. Furthermore, none of the groups showed changes in isometric muscle strength. It was concluded that the proposed acupuncture protocol did not promote improve in lower-limb muscle performance parameters in young, physically active women.
