Study Title: Topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and eccentric exercises in the treatment of mid-portion achilles tendinopathy (the NEAT trial): a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate if daily treatment with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) ointment, over 24 weeks combined with a 12-week eccentric exercise programme is more effective for chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy than placebo ointment and eccentric exercise. This was a single-site randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial at an acute hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Patients with chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy were randomised to either 24 weeks of daily GTN ointment or placebo ointment. Both groups received an identical 12-week eccentric exercise programme. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire at 24 weeks, which measures pain, function and activity. Secondary outcomes included pain severity, self-reported physical function, calf muscle function, pressure pain thresholds and ultrasound changes. Statistical analyses were performed according to intention-to-treat principles. 76 patients (30&#x2009;women; 46 men, mean age&#xb1;SD, 45.6&#xb1;8.2 years) were recruited for the trial. Significant improvements in VISA-A scores occurred in both groups at 6-week, 12-week and 24-week follow-up. The increase was not significantly different between groups, adjusted mean between-group difference from baseline to week 6, -1.33 (95% CI -6.96 to 4.31); week 12, -1.25 (95% CI -8.0 to 5.49) and week 24, -3.8 (95% CI -10.6 to 3.0); negative values favour GTN. There was no significant between-group difference in any of the secondary outcome measures at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Adding daily GTN ointment over 24 weeks to a 12-week eccentric exercise programme did not improve pain, function and activity level in patients with chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy when compared with placebo ointment.
