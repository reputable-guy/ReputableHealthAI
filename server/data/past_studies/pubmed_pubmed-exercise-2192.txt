Study Title: Effect of Baduanjin exercise on acute myocardial infarction in patients with anxiety and depression after percutaneous coronary intervention: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most severe type of coronary heart disease and patients often require percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, anxiety and depression are common complications of PCI. This study conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of Baduanjin exercise in improving cardiac function and alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients who underwent PCI for AMI. Patients with AMI (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;120) who underwent PCI at the Cardiology Department of The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between September 2020 and June 2021 were included. Participants were divided into a control group (moderate intensity walking) and a Baduanjin exercise group. The treatment period was 8 weeks, with follow-ups at weeks 4 and 8. Improvement of cardiac structure and function indices was measured by echocardiography. Physical function was assessed using the 6-minute walk test. Mental state was assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Hamilton Depression Scale before and after exercise. Compared to the control group, the Baduanjin exercise group showed improvement in change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (-1.0&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;3.4 vs -2.3&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.7&#x2005;mm, respectively; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.02), left ventricular ejection fraction (6.8&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;4.2 vs 4.5&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;4.3%, respectively; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.002), angina stability (42.5&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;31.7 vs 33.3&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;29.7, respectively; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.11), 6-minute walk test (118.4&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;49.1 vs 88.3&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;40.2&#x2005;m, respectively; P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (6.7&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.6 vs 5.3&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.6, respectively; P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.003), and Hamilton Depression Scale (7.6&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;4.1 vs 4.8&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.1, respectively; P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001) scores. Baduanjin exercise for 8 weeks improved the cardiac function and mental state of patients with anxiety and depression after PCI for AMI. Through this study, we aim to provide reliable evidence in support of the beneficial effects of Baduanjin exercise on cardiac function and anxiety-depression, contributing to evidence-based medicine.
