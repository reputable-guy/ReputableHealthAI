Study Title: Recovery of arterial blood pressure after chest compression pauses in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Study Summary:
Chest compressions generating good perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in cardiac arrest patients are critical for positive patient outcomes. Conventional wisdom advises minimizing compression pauses because several compressions are required to recover arterial blood pressure (ABP) back to pre-pause values. Our study examines how compression pauses influence ABP recovery post-pause in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We analyzed data from a subset of a prospective, randomized LUCAS 2 Active Decompression trial. Patients were treated by an anesthesiologist-staffed rapid response car program in Oslo, Norway (2015-2017) with mechanical chest compressions using the LUCAS device at 102 compressions/min. Patients with an ABP signal during CPR and at least one compression pause >2 sec were included. Arterial cannulation, compression pauses, and ECG during the pause were verified by physician review of patient records and physiological signals. Pauses were excluded if return of spontaneous circulation occurred during the pause (pressure pulses associated with ECG complexes). Compression, mean, and decompression ABP for 10 compressions before/after each pause and the mean ABP during the pause were measured with custom MATLAB code. The relationship between pause duration and ABP recovery was investigated using linear regression. We included 56 patients with a total of 271 pauses (pause duration: median&#xa0;=&#xa0;11 sec, Q1&#xa0;=&#xa0;7 sec, Q3&#xa0;=&#xa0;18 sec). Mean ABP dropped from 53&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10&#xa0;mmHg for the last pre-pause compression to 33&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7 mmHg during the pause. Compression and mean ABP recovered to >90% of pre-pause pressure within 2 compressions, or 1.7 sec. Pause duration did not affect the recovery of ABP post-pause (R: 0.05, 0.03, 0.01 for compression, mean, and decompression ABP, respectively). ABP generated by mechanical CPR recovered quickly after pauses. Recovery of ABP after a pause was independent of pause duration.
