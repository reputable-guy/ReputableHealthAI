Study Title: Examining Physical Wellness as the Fundamental Element for Achieving Holistic Well-Being in Older Persons: Review of Literature and Practical Application in Daily Life.

Study Summary:
This review examines the impact of physical activity, nutrition, and sleep evaluations on the physical wellness (PW) and overall well-being of older individuals. A comprehensive search was conducted in databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and EBSCO Information Services. The search spanned from January 2000 to December 2022, resulting in 19,400 articles, out of which 98 review articles met the inclusion criteria. Through the analysis of these articles, key characteristics of the literature were summarized, and opportunities to enhance the practical application of physical activity (PA), nutrition, and sleep evaluations in the daily lives of older persons were identified. Regular physical activity is crucial for older persons to maintain their physical, mental, and emotional well-being and prevent age-related health issues. Older persons have specific nutritional needs, including increased protein, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin B12 intake. Poor sleep quality in older persons is associated with negative health outcomes such as cognitive decline, physical disability, and mortality. This review emphasizes the significance of considering physical wellness as a fundamental element for achieving holistic well-being in older persons and highlights the importance of physical activity, nutrition, and sleep evaluations in improving their overall health and well-being. By understanding and implementing these findings, we can enhance the quality of life and promote healthy aging in older persons.
