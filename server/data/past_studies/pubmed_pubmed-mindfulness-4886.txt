Study Title: Mindfulness-based intervention in adolescents at risk for excess weight gain: 1.5-year follow-up of pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) may offer a novel means of preventing excess weight gain in adolescents, theoretically by decreasing stress-eating through altering executive functioning (EF) and food-reward sensitivity. N&#xa0;=&#xa0;54 12-17y girls and boys at-risk for excess weight gain (i.e., BMI &#x2265;70th percentile or two biological parents with reported obesity [BMI &#x2265;30&#xa0;kg/m]) participated in a 1.5-year follow-up of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing 6-week/6-session MBI (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;29) and a health education (HE) control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25). Laboratory stress-eating, food-reward sensitivity, EF, perceived stress, and BMI/adiposity were re-assessed at 1.5-years with validated measures. Changes from baseline to 1.5-year follow-up were explored with ANCOVA, accounting for the respective baseline outcome, age, and sex. Compared to MBI (M&#xa0;=&#xa0;-21, SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;59), HE had greater increases in stress-eating from baseline to 1.5-years (M&#xa0;=&#xa0;194, SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;63, Cohen's d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.59, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.01). There were no other between-condition differences. MBI may prevent worsening stress-eating for adolescents at-risk for excess weight gain. The potential for MBI as an intervention for stress-eating and ultimately, weight stabilization warrants testing in an adequately-powered trial.
