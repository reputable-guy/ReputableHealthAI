Study Title: Impact of warm mindfulness on emotion regulation: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial.

Study Summary:
To determine the effects of mindfulness training for primary care (MTPC), an integrated warm mindfulness training program, on emotion regulation and its relationship with health behavior change. Interventions that improve self-regulation, particularly emotion regulation, are needed for the self-management of comorbid chronic physical and mental illnesses. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may impact self-regulation and facilitate health behavior change. A randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial was conducted in a population of adult primary care patients to evaluate the impact of MTPC versus a low-dose mindfulness comparator (LDC) on self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) total score and other assays of self-regulation at baseline, Weeks 8 and 24. Self-reported action plan initiation was reported between Weeks 8 and 10. Participants had diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or stress-related disorders. MTPC is an 8-week insurance-reimbursable warm MBI designed to cultivate mindfulness and self-compassion and to catalyze chronic illness self-management related health behavior change. Compared to LDC, MTPC participants had statistically significant reductions in DERS total score at 8 weeks (d = -0.59, &#x3b2; = -12.98, 95% CI [-23.3 to -2.6]; p = .01) and 24 weeks (d = -0.61, &#x3b2; = -13.35, [-24.3, -2.4]; p = .02). Compared to 38% for LDC, 63% of MTPC participants successfully initiated their action plan within 3 weeks (OR = 2.87, [1.1, 7.9]; p = .04). This randomized controlled trial demonstrated MTPC enhanced emotion regulation and facilitated initiation of chronic illness self-management and health behavior change among primary care patients with anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders, replicating previous reports.
