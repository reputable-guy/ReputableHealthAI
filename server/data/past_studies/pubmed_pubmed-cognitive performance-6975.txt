Study Title: Combination antiretroviral therapy improves cognitive performance and functional connectivity in treatment-na&#xef;ve HIV-infected individuals.

Study Summary:
Our study aimed to investigate the short-term effect of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on cognitive performance and functional and structural connectivity and their relationship to plasma levels of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Seventeen ARV treatment-na&#xef;ve HIV-infected individuals (baseline mean CD4 cell count, 479&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;48 cells/mm) were age matched with 17 HIV-uninfected individuals. All subjects underwent a detailed neurocognitive and functional assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. HIV-infected subjects were scanned before starting cART and 12&#xa0;weeks after initiation of treatment. Uninfected subjects were assessed once at baseline. Functional connectivity (FC) was assessed within the default mode network while structural connectivity was assessed by voxel-wise analysis using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and probabilistic tractography within the DMN. Tenofovir and emtricitabine blood concentration were measured at week 12 of cART. Prior to cART, HIV-infected individuals had significantly lower cognitive performance than control subjects as measured by the total Z-score from the neuropsychological tests assessing six cognitive domains (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.020). After 12&#xa0;weeks of cART treatment, there remained only a weak cognitive difference between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.057). Mean FC was lower in HIV-infected individuals compared with those uninfected (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008), but FC differences became non-significant after treatment (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.197). There were no differences in DTI metrics between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals using the TBSS approach and limited evidence of decreased structural connectivity within the DMN in HIV-infected individuals. Tenofovir and emtricitabine plasma concentrations did not correlate with either cognitive performance or imaging metrics. Twelve weeks of cART improves cognitive performance and functional connectivity in ARV treatment-na&#xef;ve HIV-infected individuals with relatively preserved immune function. Longer periods of observation are necessary to assess whether this effect is maintained.
