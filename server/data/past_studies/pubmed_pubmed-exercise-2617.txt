Study Title: Early Motion and Directed Exercise (EMADE) following ankle fracture fixation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to compare the outcomes of two different postoperative management approaches following surgical fixation of ankle fractures: traditional cast immobilization versus the Early Motion and Directed Exercise (EMADE) programme. A total of 157 patients aged 18 years or older who underwent successful open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of Weber B (AO44B) ankle fractures were recruited to this randomized controlled trial. At two weeks post-surgical fixation, participants were randomized to either light-weight cast-immobilization or the EMADE programme, consisting of progressive home exercises and weekly advice and education. Both groups were restricted to non-weightbearing until six weeks post-surgery. The primary outcome was assessed using the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) questionnaire at 12 weeks post-surgery, with secondary measures at two, six, 24, and 52 weeks. Exploratory cost-effectiveness analyses were also performed. Overall, 130 participants returned their 12-week OMAS questionnaires. The mean OMAS was significantly higher in the EMADE group compared with the immobilized group (62.0 (SD 20.9) vs 48.8 (SD 22.5)), with a clinically meaningful mean difference of 13.2 (95% CI 5.66 to 20.73; p < 0.001). These differences were maintained at week 24, with convergence by week 52. No intervention-related adverse events, including instability, were reported. The EMADE programme demonstrated an accelerated recovery compared to traditional six-week cast immobilization for those who have undergone ORIF surgery to stabilize Weber B (AO44B) ankle fractures. The study found the EMADE intervention to be safe.
