Study Title: Effects of Moderate and Heavy Slow Resistance Training on Achilles and Patellar Tendons and Muscles Aponeuroses in Elderly Men.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of moderate or heavy slow resistance training on structural and mechanical properties of patellar and Achilles tendons in older men, in&#xa0;vivo. Healthy older men (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) undertook a 12-week resistance training program (3 times/week) of triceps surae and quadriceps muscle-tendon complexes. Participants were randomly assigned to either a moderate load of 55% 1RM (O55, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13, age: 70.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.6&#x2009;years) or a progressively heavier load from 55% up to 80% 1RM (O80, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14, age: 69.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.4&#x2009;years). Tendon morphology was investigated using a 1.5&#x2009;T MRI scanner. Mechanical properties of the free Achilles tendon (AT) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) aponeurosis, patellar tendon (PT), and deep aponeurosis of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle were assessed using ultrasound imaging. Both training programs led to an increase in mean CSA of the PT (O55; +2.7%, O80; +1.7%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and AT (O55; +2.8%, O80; +2.5%, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Force and stress were increased for all the four regions investigated, while stiffness and Young's modulus assessed at a common force level were only increased for the AT and VL aponeurosis. No interaction between group and time was demonstrated for any of the outcomes. No interaction between time and the four tendon sites was observed for any of the outcomes at common force. A supervised short-term heavy or moderate slow resistance training of equal volume yielded an increase in tendon size and altered mechanical properties of tendinous tissue.
