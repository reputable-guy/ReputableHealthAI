Study Title: Determinants of knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy towards complementary feeding among rural mothers: Baseline data of a cluster-randomized control trial in South West Ethiopia.

Study Summary:
Complementary feeding (CF) is the period when exclusive breastfeeding ends and the introduction of a wide range of foods while breastfeeding should continue until the child is at least 24 months of age. Sub-optimal complementary feeding practices of infants and young children persist due to different factors, which include knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy of index mothers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess determinants of knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy towards complementary feeding among rural mothers with index child in rural Ethiopia. A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using multistage sampling techniques followed by systematic random sampling techniques. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests were used to assess the baseline differences in the CF knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy and socio-demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups. An independent sample t-test was used to determine the mean differences. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to assess the predictors of complementary feeding knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy. All tests were two-tailed, and a statistically significant association was considered at a p-value &#x2264; 0.05. Overall, 516 mothers were interviewed. 52.5% of the mothers had high complementary feeding (CF) knowledge, whereas only 47.7% and 38.9% had favorable attitude and high self-efficacy, respectively. The socio-demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups were overall similar. However, there was a significant difference in the child's sex (p = 0.021) and age (p = 0.002). Independent t-tests found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the mean score of CF knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy at baseline. Maternal educational status (p = 0.0001), number of ANC visits (p = 0.025), and CF information received (p = 0.011) were significant predictors of CF knowledge. Child sex (p = 0.021) and the number of ANC visits (p = 0.01) were significant predictors of CF attitude. Family size (p = 0.008) and household food security status (p = 0.005) were significant predictors of maternal CF self-efficacy. Overall, half of the mothers had high knowledge. Whereas maternal attitudes and self-efficacy toward CF were low. Maternal educational status, the number of ANC visits, and the CF information received were predictors of CF knowledge. Likewise, child sex and the number of ANC visits were predictors of CF attitude. Family size and household food security status were predictors of CF self-efficacy. These findings imply that nutrition intervention strategies are mandatory, particularly to enhance maternal knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy towards optimum complementary feeding.
