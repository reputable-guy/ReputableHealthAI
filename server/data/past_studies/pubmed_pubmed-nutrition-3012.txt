Study Title: A Prescription Produce Program integrating lifestyle behavior counseling and health education: A program description and evaluation.

Study Summary:
Prescription Produce Programs (PPPs) are increasingly being used to address food insecurity and healthy diets. Yet, limited evidence exists on the effectiveness of integrating lifestyle counseling within a PPP to promote dietary and health behaviors. To describe the implementation of a 6- or 12-week PPP integrating lifestyle counseling to low-income adults. The PPP was implemented as part of a wellness and care coordination program and included: (i) a screening for social needs, (ii) PPP health education and lifestyle counseling visits, and (iii) distribution of produce. We conducted a pre- and post-descriptive analysis. We also reported a case study illustrating the PPP implementation and a Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats analysis. Fifty-three participants (85% Black American, 64% female, mean age: 66 years) completed the PPP. Food insecurity scores significantly decreased between pre- and post-enrollment in the PPP (P = .002). Compared with pre-enrollment, participants who completed the PPP reported an increase in the frequency of fruits and vegetables intake (&#x3c7;2 = 12.6, P = .006). A majority of the participants (77%) reported setting and achieving at least one health-related goal by the end of the program. A strength of the PPP included the long-standing relationship with community partners. Weaknesses included the survey burden, the need for additional personnel, and the need for a sustained funding source. Integrating lifestyle counseling within a PPP can promote food security and a healthy diet. Future research is warranted using rigorous research methods, including randomization and a comparison group.
