Study Title: HOMEFOOD Randomised Trial - Six-Month Nutrition Therapy in Discharged Older Adults Reduces Hospital Readmissions and Length of Stay at Hospital Up to 18 Months of Follow-Up.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition is frequently observed in older adults and is associated with hospital readmissions, length of stay (LOS), and mortality in discharged patients. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of six-month nutrition therapy on hospital readmissions, LOS, mortality and need for long-term care residence 1-, 6-, 12- and 18-months post-discharge in older Icelandic adults. Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Participants (>65 years) were randomised into intervention (n=53) and control (n=53) before discharge from a geriatric unit. The intervention group received nutrition therapy based on the Nutrition Care Process, including home visits, phone calls, freely delivered energy- and protein-rich foods and supplements for six months after hospital discharge. The Icelandic electronic hospital registry was accessed to gain information on emergency room visits (ER), hospital readmissions, LOS, mortality and need for long-term care residence. The intervention group had a lower proportion of participants with at least one readmission compared to control (1 month: 1.9% vs 15.8%, P=0.033; 6 months: 25.0% vs 46.2%, P=0.021; 12 months: 38.5% vs 55.8%, P=0.051; and 18 months: 51.9% vs 65.4%, P=0.107). There was also a lower total number of readmissions per participant (1 month: 0.02 vs 0.19, P=0.015; 6 month: 0.33 vs 0.77, P=0.014; 0.62 vs 1.12, P=0.044) and a shorter LOS (1 month: 0.02 vs 0.92, P=0.013; 6 months: 2.44 vs 13.21; P=0.006; 12 months: 5.83 vs 19.40, P=0.034; 18 months: 10.42 vs 26.00, P=0.033) in the intervention group. However, there were no differences between groups in ER visits, mortality and need for long-term care residence. A six-month nutrition therapy in older Icelandic adults discharged from hospital reduced hospital readmissions and shortens LOS at the hospital up to 18-months post-discharge. However, it did neither affect mortality, ER, nor need of long-term care residence in this group.
