Study Title: Effects of hand-bathing on noise-induced vasoconstriction: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study assessed the effects of hand-bathing on sympathetic nervous activity exacerbated by psychological stress. Participants immersed one hand in warm water for 2 min while exposed to noise, and changes in blood flow and skin temperature of the non-immersed hand were observed. Twenty-nine healthy university students aged 20&#x2009;years or older were randomly assigned to either the hand-bathing group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14) or the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). After a brief rest in a quiet environment, participants were exposed to noise for 6 min. Those in the hand-bathing group submerged their left hand in a 40&#xb0;C thermostatic bath for 2 min, starting 2 min into the noise exposure. The tympanic temperature, blood flow, and skin temperature of the non-immersed hand were continuously measured, along with blood pressure and subjective evaluations before and after the noise exposure. Both groups experienced a decrease in fingertip skin temperature at the start of the noise exposure, persisting longer in the control group. Conversely, the hand-bathing group showed increased fingertip skin temperature after 150&#x2009;s, significantly higher after the noise exposure than the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04). Participants in the hand-bathing group reported significantly increased overall body warmth, thermal comfort, and relaxation during hand-bathing (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). The 2-min hand-bathing intervention reversed the pronounced vasoconstrictive response induced by noise exposure and elicited heightened sensations of overall body warmth, thermal comfort, and relaxation. Hand-bathing may mitigate heightened sympathetic nervous activity associated with psychological stress induced by noise exposure.
