Study Title: Effect of a new resistance training method on the metaboreflex in cardiac rehabilitation patients: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Patients with cardiac disease exhibit exaggerated sympathoexcitation, pressor, and ventilatory responses to muscle metaboreflex activation (MMA). However, the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and especially resistance training (RT) modalities on MMA are not well known. This study investigated how CR impacts MMA in such patients, specifically examining the effects of two different resistance training (RT) protocols following 12&#xa0;weeks of CR. In addition to endurance exercises, 32 patients were randomized into either a 3/7 RT modality (comprising 5 sets of 3-7 repetitions) or a control (CTRL) modality (involving 3 sets of 9 repetitions), with distinct inter-set rest intervals (15&#xa0;s for 3/7 and 60&#xa0;s for CTRL). MMA, gauged by blood pressure (BP) and ventilatory (Ve) responses during a handgrip exercise at 40% effort and subsequent post-exercise circulatory occlusion, demonstrated CR's significant impact. Systolic BP, initially at&#x2009;+&#x2009;28&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;23% pre-CR, improved to&#x2009;+&#x2009;11&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15% post-CR (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.011 time effect; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.131 group effect). Diastolic BP showed a similar trend, from&#x2009;+&#x2009;27&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;23% to&#x2009;+&#x2009;13&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15% (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.099 time effect; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.087 group effect). Ve, initially at&#x2009;+&#x2009;60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;39%, reduced to&#x2009;+&#x2009;14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;19% post-CR (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001 time effect; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.142 group effect). Critical parameters-maximal oxygen consumption, lean mass, hand grip, and quadriceps strength-exhibited parallel increases in both 3/7 and CTRL groups (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05 time effect; P&#x2009;>&#x2009;.3 group effect). Ultimately, CR demonstrated comparable improvements in MMA across both RT modalities, indicating its positive influence on cardiovascular responses and physical performance in individuals with cardiac conditions.
