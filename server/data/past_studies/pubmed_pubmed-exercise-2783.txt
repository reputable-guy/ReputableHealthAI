Study Title: Preventing radiation-induced dysphagia and trismus in head and neck cancer-A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Radiation-induced dysphagia and restricted mouth opening are common problems among patients with head and neck cancer. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to determine if an exercise protocol could prevent swallowing and mouth opening impairment. Eighty-nine participants were randomly assigned to either an active group performing preventive swallowing and mouth opening exercises (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45) or to a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;44). Outcome measures were collected at baseline before radiotherapy and approximately 1-month post-treatment. Primary endpoints were changes in swallowing function according to the Penetration Aspiration Scale and mouth opening ability measured in millimeters. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. Swallowing function and mouth opening deteriorated in both groups, with no statistically significant positive effect of the protocol detected at follow-up. Among patients who completed >75% of exercises, there was a trend toward better outcomes. Preventive exercises did not improve short-term swallowing function and mouth opening after radiotherapy.
