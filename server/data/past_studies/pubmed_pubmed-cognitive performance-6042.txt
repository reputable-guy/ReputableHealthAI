Study Title: Longitudinal Trajectories of the Cognitive Function Index in the A4 Study.

Study Summary:
The Anti-Amyloid in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) Study failed to show a treatment benefit with solanezumab, but the longitudinal consequences of elevated amyloid were observed in study participants with objective decline on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) and subjective decline on the combined Cognitive Function Index (participant + study partner CFI), during the trial period. We sought to expand on previous findings by comparing longitudinal patterns of participant and study partner CFI separately and their associations with the PACC stratified by baseline amyloid tertile over the course of the A4 Study. Cognitively unimpaired older adult participants and their study partners were independently administered the CFI at screen prior to amyloid PET disclosure and then at 3 subsequent visits (week 48, week 168, week 240) of the study. PACC collected at visits concurrent with CFI administration were also examined longitudinally. The A4 Study was conducted at 67 sites in Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. 1,147 participants with elevated amyloid based on florbetapir PET were enrolled in the A4 Study and included in these analyses. 583 were on placebo and 564 were treated with solanezumab. The PACC was used to assess objective cognitive performance and the CFI was used to assess change in everyday cognitive functioning by the participant and their study partner independently. Amyloid level was characterized by Centiloid tertiles (<46.1 CL, 46.1 to 77.2 CL, >77.2 CL). Participants were aware of their elevated amyloid status, but not their CL tertile, or specific level of amyloid. Longitudinal correlations between participant and study partner CFI and PACC were examined at all visits where assessments were available. The impact of baseline amyloid tertile on CFI and PACC associations was also examined. Both participant and study partner CFI increased over the duration of the study indicating worsening cognitive functioning. Results did not differ by treatment group. The association between higher CFI and worse PACC for both for participant and study partner became progressively stronger over the course of the study. PACC had a significantly higher correlation with study partner CFI than with participant CFI by week 168. The stronger correlations between study partner CFI and PACC were driven by those in the highest amyloid tertile. Both participant and study partner report captured subtle changes in everyday cognitive functioning for participants with biomarker confirmed and disclosed preclinical AD. Moreover, study partner report was most highly aligned with cognitive decline, particularly among those with the highest amyloid load.
