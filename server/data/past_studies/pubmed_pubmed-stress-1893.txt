Study Title: The effect of a training program on family stress and life satisfaction: A randomized controlled study of mothers of children with disabilities.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled study focused on mothers of children with disabilities to determine the effect of a training program on family stress and life satisfaction. The sample consisted of 52 mothers of children with disabilities (intervention group&#xa0;=&#xa0;26 and control group&#xa0;=&#xa0;26). The intervention group participated in a five-session training program on coping mechanisms and life satisfaction. Data were collected using the Questionnaire On Resource And Stress (QRS-FT) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). After the intervention, the mean life satisfaction scores of the intervention group participants increased (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), while their mean total score of family stress decreased (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). In the control group, the mean life satisfaction scores decreased (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05), while the mean total score of family stress increased (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The intervention helped mothers of children with disabilities experience more satisfaction with life and less family stress. Authorities should consider the outcomes of educational intervention studies and formulate training programs for mothers of children with disabilities. Nurses can use interactive educational programs as nursing interventions to help mothers of children with disabilities experience less family stress and more life satisfaction.
