Study Title: Effects of Intranasal Insulin Pretreatment on Preoperative Sleep Quality and Postoperative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Valve Replacement for Rheumatic Heart Disease.

Study Summary:
Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common neurological complication associated with valve replacement. Preoperative sleep disturbance is a risk factor for POD development, and nasal insulin modulates the sleep-wake cycle. This study investigated the beneficial effects of intranasal insulin pretreatment on preoperative sleep quality and reducing POD in patients undergoing valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease. This prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 76 adult patients aged 18-65 years undergoing valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass who were randomly allocated to receive intranasal insulin or normal saline interventions two days before surgery. POD incidence was on postoperative days 1 (T3), 2 (T4), and 3 (T5). Before the first intervention (T0), 1 d before surgery (T1), and before anesthesia on the day of surgery (T2), sleep quality was assessed and serum cortisol concentrations were measured. At T1 and T2, sleep quality related indicators monitored by sleep monitoring watches from the previous night were recorded. Compared with the normal saline group, 3 days after surgery, the insulin group showed a significantly reduced incidence of POD; significantly increased deep sleep, REM sleep, deep sleep continuity, and total sleep quality scores at T1 and T2; and significantly reduced serum cortisol concentration, PSQI scale, light sleep ratio, and wakefulness at T1 and T2. The administration of 20 U of intranasal insulin twice daily, from 2 days preoperatively until 10 minutes preanesthesia on the day of surgery, can improved preoperative sleep quality significantly and reduced POD incidence in patients with rheumatic heart disease undergoing valve replacement. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn, with the unique identifier ChiCTR2100048515; July 9, 2021).
