Study Title: Inflammatory markers and noncoding-RNAs responses to low and high compressions of HIIT with or without berberine supplementation in middle-aged men with prediabetes.

Study Summary:
This study compared the capacity of two different models of HIIT [high-(HC) and low-(LC) compression], with or without the use of berberine (BBR), on NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein-3 (NLRP3), H19, interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2;, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and insulin resistance markers. Fifty-four middle-aged men with overweight or obesity and prediabetes [fasting blood glucose (FBG) 110-180&#x2009;mg/dL] were randomly and equally assigned to the HC, LC, HC&#x2009;+&#x2009;BBR, LC&#x2009;+&#x2009;BBR, BBR, and non-exercising control (CON) groups. The HC (2:1 work-to-rest) and LC (1:1 work-to-rest) home-based training programs included 2-4 sets of 8 exercises at 80%-95% HRmax, twice a week for 8&#x2009;weeks. Participants in the berberine groups received approximately 1000&#x2009;mg daily. All exercise interventions led to a significant reduction in hs-CRP, IL-1&#x3b2;, insulin, FBG, and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) versus CON. Notably, there was a significant reduction in FBG and HOMA-IR with the BBR group compared to the baseline. Both NLRP3 and H19 experienced a significant drop only with LC in comparison to the baseline. While both exercise protocols were beneficial overall, LC uniquely exhibited more anti-inflammatory effects, as indicated by reductions in H19 and NLRP3. However, the addition of berberine to the exercise programs did not demonstrate additional benefits.
