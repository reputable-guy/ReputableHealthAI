Study Title: Pain neuroscience education improves post-traumatic stress disorder, disability, and pain self-efficacy in veterans and service members with chronic low back pain: Preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up.

Study Summary:
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) are frequently co-morbid. Some research suggests that PTSD and CLBP may share common neurobiological mechanisms related to stress. Traditional biomedical education may be ineffective for PTSD and CLBP, especially when co-morbid. The purpose of this study is to determine if pain neuroscience education (PNE) is more effective than traditional education in reducing PTSD, disability, pain, and maladaptive beliefs in patients with CLBP. Participants with CLBP and possible PTSD/PTSD-symptoms were recruited for this study. Participants were randomly allocated to a PNE group or a traditional education group. The intervention included 30&#xa0;minutes of education followed by a standardized exercise program once a week for 4-weeks with a 4 and 8-week follow-up and healthcare utilization assessed at 12-months. Forty-eight participants consented for this research study with 39 allocated to treatment (PNE n =&#xa0;18, traditional n =&#xa0;21). PNE participants were more likely to achieve a clinically meaningful reduction in PTSD symptoms and disability at short-term follow-up. At 12-months, the PNE group utilized healthcare with 76% lower costs. In participants with CLBP, PNE may reduce hypervigilance toward pain and improve PTSD symptoms. Participants who received PNE were more confident body-tissues were safe to exercise. These beliefs about pain could contribute to a decrease in perceived disability and healthcare consumption for CLBP.
