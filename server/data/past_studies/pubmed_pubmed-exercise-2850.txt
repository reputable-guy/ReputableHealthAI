Study Title: The Effect of a Short-Term Mindfulness Program on Motor Skills and on Psychological and Social Behavior in Preschool Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
We assessed the effect of a one-week mindfulness-based intervention on resilience, social behavior, and motor skills in four to five-year-old children. In this randomized controlled trial, 45 children (22 females; 23 males;age = 4.5,= 0.4 years) from the same preschool were randomly assigned to three groups: (a) a mindfulness group (MG;= 15) that participated in five 30-min mindfulness sessions; (b) a physical activity group (PAG;= 15) that engaged in five 45-min physical exercise sessions; and a control group (CG;= 15) that received no intervention. Training sessions were held on five consecutive days. Prior to (T0) and after the five mindfulness sessions (T1), all participants blindly completed the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (to assess their motor skills), the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (to evaluate their behavior), and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure-28 (to measure their resilience). At baseline (T0), there were no significant differences between the groups. The mindfulness group experienced the strongest positive effects after the intervention (T1), with improvements in both motor skills and social behavior, though there was no significant effect on resilience. Our results suggest that a brief mindfulness training intervention is a promising strategy for improving motor skills and social behavior in early childhood settings.
