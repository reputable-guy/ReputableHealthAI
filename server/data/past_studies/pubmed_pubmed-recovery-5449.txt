Study Title: The Effects of Music Intervention on Quality of Life, Anxiety, and Fatigue Among Patients With Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To determine the effects of music intervention on quality of life, anxiety, and fatigue among patients with breast cancer. 170 individuals from the general surgery unit of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Individuals who had received a mastectomy were randomly assigned to a treatment group or control group. In the treatment group, participants received music intervention for an hour each week, totaling 12 hours during 12 consecutive weeks. The primary variable was quality of life, and secondary variables were anxiety and fatigue. Greater quality of life was seen in the treatment group at 12 weeks. In the treatment group, participants showed significant improvement in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (trait), which was most significant at eight weeks. No statistically significant difference was observed in fatigue levels after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of music intervention. Music intervention may improve anxiety and quality of life of patients with breast cancer. Music intervention could be established following mastectomy and continued throughout recovery.
