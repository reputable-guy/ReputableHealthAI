Study Title: The effects of mindfulness meditation versus CBT for anxiety on emotional distress and attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment: a semi-randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Older adults often avoid seeking psychological treatment, thus challenging their ability to cope effectively with anxiety, stress, and depression. The current study aimed to compare the effects of a mindfulness intervention with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on measures of emotional distress and attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment among older adults. Twenty-four seniors were assigned to three groups: (1) Mindfulness-based intervention for seniors (MBIS), (2) CBT for anxiety, or (3) a care-as-usual control group. Participants in the two intervention groups of eight weekly sessions were randomly assigned. Results showed that attitudes toward seeking psychological treatment and depression, anxiety, and worry levels were evaluated before and after the interventions. Following both interventions, participants considered the prospect of utilizing psychological treatment more positively, whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Interestingly, worry levels were eased only in the MBIS group, and anxiety levels were eased only in the CBT group. Our findings support the understanding that cognitive group interventions can effectively achieve their intended aim (decreasing worry or anxiety) and positively impact attitudes toward psychological treatment.Trial registration: clinicaltrials, NCT04165005, 15/11/19.
