Study Title: Follow-up of a randomized trial optimizing neonatal nutrition in preterm very low birthweight infants: growth, serum adipokines, renal function and blood pressure.

Study Summary:
The primary objectives were to compare body mass index (BMI) Z-score (Z), systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum leptin:adiponectin (L:A) ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at ~3 years adjusted age between two arms of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two modes of human milk fortification for very low-birthweight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Follow-up of RCT at 33-48 months. Follow-up data are available in 82/120 infants. Infants in the experimental arm have anthropometric data consistent with central obesity and higher serum L:A ratio (sensitivity analysis adjusting for sex and using all available data), but have similar eGFR and SBP at follow-up compared with controls. Serum L:A ratio is strongly correlated with anthropometric measurements suggesting central obesity. Infants in the experimental arm have central obesity and higher serum L:A ratio compared with controls. Notably, serum L:A ratio is strongly correlated with weight gain. This randomized controlled trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02372136.
