Study Title: The Influence of Emergency Call Volume on Occupational Workload and Sleep Quality in Urban Firefighters.

Study Summary:
The aim of the study is to determine the impact of emergency call volume on exertion, autonomic activity, and sleep among urban structural firefighters. Thirty-four firefighters wore a wrist-based monitor to track sleep and autonomic parameters and rated their level of perceived exertion (Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion) and subjective sleepiness after a 24-hour shift. Predictive variables included total run time and total run time after 11:59 PM. Total run time and sleep duration accounted for Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion and subjective sleepiness, while total run time and total run time after 11:59 PM accounted for sleep durations on-duty. The current results suggest that emergency call volume is associated with indicators of exertion and sleep. As such, call volume tracking is an important consideration for departments to ensure personnel readiness and wellness and provide a method of tracking the occupational demands experienced by firefighters on-duty.
