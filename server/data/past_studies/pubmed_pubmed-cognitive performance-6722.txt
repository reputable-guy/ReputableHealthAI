Study Title: Age-Related Effect of Antihypertensive Treatment on Cognitive Performance: Is it Better Preventing Dementia in Older Age?

Study Summary:
The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of optimal antihypertensive medication on cognitive function. In this 6-month clinical trial, 248 adults were randomly selected by a registry of hypertensive-treated patients (based on a National Hypertension Treatment Program), followed health centers located in Rafsanjan County, Southeast, Iran. Blood pressure was measured 3 times in each appointment pre- and posttreatment. Mini-Mental State Examination was used for cognitive performance evaluation. Pairedtest and multiple regression model showed significant correlation between "the differences of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels" and "cognitive performance in treated patients more than 40 years old." Cognitive performance was not significantly different in patients less than 40 years old post antihypertensive treatment. Cognitive performance scores demonstrated significant increase in responders more than 40 years old post antihypertensive treatment. Antihypertensive treatment in responders with age equal or more than 40 years improves the level of cognitive performance significantly.
