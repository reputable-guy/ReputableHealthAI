Study Title: A new set of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness equations are associated with cognitive performance in older adults.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to develop new equations to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness specifically for older adults and, secondly, to analyze the associations of cardiorespiratory fitness, both objectively measured and estimated using new equations, with cognitive performance. Ninety-two older adults (41 females, 65-75&#xa0;years) from baseline data of a randomized controlled trial were analyzed ("ClinicalTrials.gov" Identifier: NCT03923712). Participants completed 4 measurement sessions including (i) physiological and health indicators in a laboratory setting, (ii) field-based fitness tests, (iii) sociodemographic and physical activity questionnaires, and (iv) a battery of neuropsychological tests to evaluate cognitive performance. The main findings were as follows: (i) a set of new equations with good predictive value for estimated cardiorespiratory fitness were developed (74-87%), using different scenarios of complexity and/or equipment requirements, and (ii) higher estimated cardiorespiratory fitness, even using its simplest equation (eCRF&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;1261.99&#x2009;+&#x2009;1.97&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;6&#xa0;min walking test (m)&#x2009;+&#x2009;1.12&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;bioimpedance basal metabolic rate (kcal/day)&#x2009;+&#x2009;5.25&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;basal heart rate (bpm)), was associated with better cognitive performance evaluated by several neuropsychological tests (i.e., language, cognitive flexibility, fluency, attention, and working memory), similar to using objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness. In summary, a new set of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness equations have been developed with predictive values ranging from 74 to 87% that could be used based on necessity, availability of equipment, resources, or measurement context. Moreover, similar to objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness, this measure of estimated cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with performance on language, fluency, cognitive flexibility, attention, and working memory, independently of sex, age, and education level.
