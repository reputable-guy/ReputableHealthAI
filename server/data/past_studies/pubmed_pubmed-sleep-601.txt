Study Title: The interactive effect of sustained sleep restriction and resistance exercise on skeletal muscle transcriptomics in young females.

Study Summary:
Both sleep loss and exercise regulate gene expression in skeletal muscle, yet little is known about how the interaction of these stressors affects the transcriptome. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nine nights of sleep restriction (SR), with repeated resistance exercise (REx) sessions, on the skeletal muscle transcriptome of young, trained females. Ten healthy females aged 18-35 yr old undertook a randomized cross-over study of nine nights of SR (5 h time in bed) and normal sleep (NS; &#x2265;7 h time in bed) with a minimum 6-wk washout. Participants completed four REx sessions per condition (,,, and). Muscle biopsies were collected both pre- and post-REx onand. Gene and protein expression were assessed by RNA sequencing and Western blot, respectively. Three or nine nights of SR had no effect on the muscle transcriptome independently of exercise. However, close to 3,000 transcripts were differentially regulated (false discovery rate < 0.05) 48 h after the completion of three resistance exercise sessions in both NS and SR conditions. Only 39% of downregulated genes and 18% of upregulated genes were common between both conditions, indicating a moderating effect of SR on the response to exercise. SR and REx interacted to alter the enrichment of skeletal muscle transcriptomic pathways in young, resistance-trained females. Performing exercise when sleep restricted may not provide the same adaptive response for individuals as if they were fully rested.This study investigated the effect of nine nights of sleep restriction, with repeated resistance exercise sessions, on the skeletal muscle transcriptome of young, trained females.
