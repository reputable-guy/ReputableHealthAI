Study Title: Efficacy of Integrated Tele-Yoga Intervention on Physiological and Psychological Variables in Asymptomatic COVID-19 Positive Patients: A Confirmatory Randomized Control Trial.

Study Summary:
A study was conducted on asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients admitted in a COVID-19 hospital in Indore, India, during first wave of the pandemic. The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of an integrated tele-yoga intervention as an adjunct to conventional management on physiological, psychological, and mindfulness variables. In a confirmatory randomized control trial, 60 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in hospital confinement were randomly allocated to experimental and control groups (n = 30). The tele-yoga intervention included breathing exercise, pranayama, and meditation delivered over 30 min for 7 days to the experimental group while the control group continued treatment as usual. Assessment of physiological variables and psychological variables was carried out before intervention and on day 7 immediately after intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS (v.16.0). Mann-Whitney U test shows that there was a statistically significant difference between groups regarding all variables (p < 0.001). The physiological and psychological variables which included Oxygen saturation (2.07%), Heart rate (8.21%), Respiratory rate (10.04%), Systolic blood pressure (6.14%), Diastolic blood pressure (8.38%), Visual Analog Scale for stress (62.78%), COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (68.44%), and State Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (72.72%) showed significant changes in the experimental group compared to control group. The results of this study suggest that integrated tele-yoga might have therapeutic benefits in improving physiological, psychological, and mindfulness variables in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.
