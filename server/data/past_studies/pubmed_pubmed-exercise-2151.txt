Study Title: Impact of Baduanjin Qigong Exercise on Fatigue in Patients with Lung Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Patients report fatigue as the most distressing symptom associated with cancer and treatment. Baduanjin has beneficial effects on reducing fatigue. However, no relevant randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of Baduanjin exercise with routine exercise in patients with lung cancer and fatigue have been reported.This blinded trial aimed to compare the effect of Baduanjin versus routine exercise on fatigue for patients with lung cancer. Participants in the intervention group received Baduanjin training and performed Baduanjin every week, while those in the control group performed routine exercise at the same frequency.A total of 73 patients were analyzed. After the intervention, patients in the Baduanjin group experienced significant improvement in fatigue and pain (< 0.05), while no significant difference in Edmonton Symptom Assessment System items were observed among patients in the exercise group.Our study showed that Baduanjin was a better exercise than routine activity in relieving their fatigue.
