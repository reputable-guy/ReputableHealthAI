Study Title: Effects of combined resistance training and Tai Chi on oxidative stress, blood glucose and lipid metabolism and quality of life in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Study Summary:
This study examined the effects of resistance training (RT), Tai Chi (TC) and combination intervention (RT & TC) on the oxidative stress, blood glucose and lipid metabolism and quality of life of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ninety-four elderly patients with T2DM were randomly divided into an RT group (RTG,&#x2009;=&#x2009;23), TC group (TCG,&#x2009;=&#x2009;24), combination intervention group (CIG,&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) and control group (CG,&#x2009;=&#x2009;23). All participants were given nutrition and medication. On this basis, RTG, TCG and CIG were administered for 24&#x2009;weeks (3 times/week, 40&#x2009;minutes/time). Observation indicators were malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes specific quality of life (DSQL). RT, TC and joint intervention can reduce the oxidative stress damage on elderly patients with T2DM to different degrees, control the levels of blood sugar and blood lipid and improve the quality of life. Compared with single intervention, combination intervention can further reduce the level of oxidative stress but has no additional benefits on blood glucose and lipid control and quality of life.
