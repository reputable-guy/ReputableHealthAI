Study Title: A Path to Resilience: The Impact of School-Based Yoga on Adolescent Mental Well-Being.

Study Summary:
Adolescent mental health is an increasing global concern, with rising levels of stress, anxiety, and depression driven by academic pressure and social expectations. School-based yoga programs are accessible and efficacious interventions for improving mental well-being. Systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials have indicated that yoga interventions improve psychological, cognitive, and physical outcomes in youth, addressing both preventive and therapeutic mental health needs. However, given the diversity of yoga styles and protocols, further research is required to identify the specific types or components of yoga that are most effective and feasible in school-based programs. These benefits stem from yoga's impact on stress regulation, emotional awareness, social interactions, and physical well-being. Practical considerations for school implementation include age-appropriate design, teacher training, inclusivity, and parental involvement. With substantial evidence supporting the role of yoga in adolescent mental health, schools can integrate it into their wellness curriculum. As mental health issues persist, school-based yoga offers a proactive approach to fostering resilience and assisting youths in navigating life challenges. This editorial reviews evidence on the benefits of yoga for adolescents, emphasising emotional regulation, stress reduction, and resilience.
