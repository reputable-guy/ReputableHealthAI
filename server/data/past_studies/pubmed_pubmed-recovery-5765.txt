Study Title: Quality-of-life outcomes of the ROBOtic-assisted versus Conventional Open Partial nephrectomy (ROBOCOP) II trial.

Study Summary:
To comprehensively compare quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes between open partial nephrectomy (OPN) and robot-assisted PN (RAPN) from the randomised ROBOtic-assisted versus Conventional Open Partial nephrectomy (ROBOCOP) II trial, as QoL data comparing OPN and RAPN are virtually non-existent, especially not from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The ROBOCOP II was a single-centre, open-label RCT between OPN and RAPN. The pre-planned analyses of QoL outcomes are presented. Data were analysed descriptively in a modified intention-to-treat population. A total of 50 patients underwent surgery. At postoperative Day 90 (POD90), there was no significant difference for the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form questionnaire score (mean [sd] OPN 72&#x2009;[20] vs RAPN 76&#x2009;[15], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.850), while there were advantages for RAPN in the subdomains of 'Pain' (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006) and 'Physical functioning' (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011) immediately after surgery. For the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire 30-item core there were overall advantages directly after surgery (mean [sd] score OPN 63&#x2009;[20] vs RAPN 75&#x2009;[17], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031), as well as for the subdomains 'Fatigue' (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026), 'Pain' (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and 'Constipation' (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045) but no differences at POD90. There were no differences for the EuroQoL five Dimensions five Levels questionnaire at POD90 (mean [sd] score OPN 70&#x2009;[22] vs RAPN 72&#x2009;[17], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0) or at any other time point. Finally, no significant differences were found for the overall Convalescence and Recovery Evaluation questionnaire score at POD90 (mean [sd] OPN 84&#x2009;[13] vs RAPN 86&#x2009;[10], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.818) but less pain in the RAPN group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017) directly after surgery. Pain and physical functioning as subdomains of QoL are improved after RAPN compared to OPN in the early postoperative course, while there are no differences anymore after 3&#x2009;months.
