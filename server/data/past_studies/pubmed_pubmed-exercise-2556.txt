Study Title: The Effect of a Synthetic-Grass Sport Surface on Physiology and Perception During Intermittent Exercise in Hot Conditions.

Study Summary:
The current study aimed to determine the effect of a synthetic-grass sport surface on core body temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE)&#xa0;during intermittent exercise in hot conditions. Using a randomized crossover design, 13 trained/developmental team-sport athletes completed two 50-minute standardized intermittent running protocols on a synthetic and a&#xa0;natural-grass surface, on separate days (control-condition air temperature 32.6 &#xb0;C [1.3 &#xb0;C], relative humidity 43.2% [5.3%]). Final skin temperature was significantly higher on synthetic compared with natural grass at the calf (40.1 &#xb0;C [2.5 &#xb0;C] vs 33.4 &#xb0;C [0.6 &#xb0;C]; P < .001), shoulder (36.6 &#xb0;C [1.7 &#xb0;C] vs 33.7 &#xb0;C [0.7 &#xb0;C]; P < .001), and chest (33.2 &#xb0;C [1.1 &#xb0;C] vs 31.8 &#xb0;C [1.2 &#xb0;C]; P = .02). Thermal sensation (median: 2.3; interquartile range [0.5] vs 2.2 [0.5], P = .03) and sweat rate (1.5 [0.4]&#xa0;L&#xb7;h-1 vs 1.2 [0.3]&#xa0;L&#xb7;h-1; P = .02) were also significantly higher on synthetic grass. While final core body temperature was significantly higher on the natural than synthetic grass (38.4 &#xb0;C [0.3 &#xb0;C] vs 38.2 &#xb0;C [0.4 &#xb0;C]),&#xa0;there were no significant differences in delta core temperature, as well as heart rate, thermal comfort, or RPE. Higher skin temperatures, thermal sensation, and sweat rates suggest that exercising on synthetic grass in hot conditions may increase some markers of heat strain during exercise. However, delta core body temperature, heart rate, thermal comfort, and RPE remained unaffected.
