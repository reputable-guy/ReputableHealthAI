Study Title: Pilot study indicates that a gluten-free diet lowers oxidative stress for gluten-sensitive persons with schizophrenia.

Study Summary:
One-third of people with schizophrenia have elevated levels of anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA IgG). A 5-week randomized double-blind pilot study was performed in 2014-2017 in an inpatient setting to test the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who also had elevated AGA IgG (&#x2265; 20&#xa0;U) but were negative for celiac disease. This earlier pilot study reported that the GFD-group showed improved gastrointestinal and psychiatric symptoms, and also improvements in TNF-&#x3b1; and the inflammatory cytokine IL-23. Here, we performed measurements of these banked plasma samples to detect levels of oxidative stress (OxSt) using a recently developed iridium (Ir)-reducing capacity assay. Triplicate measurements of these samples showed an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.84 which indicates good reproducibility. Further, a comparison of the OxSt measurements at the baseline and 5-week end-point for this small sample size shows that the GFD-group (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;7) had lowered OxSt levels compared to the gluten-containing diet group (GCD; N&#xa0;=&#xa0;9; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05). Finally, we showed that improvements in OxSt over these 5&#xa0;weeks were correlated to improvements in gastrointestinal (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;+0.64, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0073) and psychiatric (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;+0.52, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.039) symptoms. Also, we showed a possible association between the decrease in OxSt and the lowered levels of IL-23 (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;+0.44, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.087), although without statistical significance. Thus, the Ir-reducing capacity assay provides a simple, objective measure of OxSt with the results providing further evidence that inflammation, redox dysregulation and OxSt may mediate interactions between the gut and brain.
