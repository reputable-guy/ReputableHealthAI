Study Title: Effectiveness of an Internet-Based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention for Reducing Psychological Distress in Health Care Professionals: Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Psychological distress is prevalent among health care professionals and can lead to poor-quality patient care. Internet-based acceptance and commitment therapy (iACT) is a promising intervention for improving mental health due to its low cost and easy access. However, there is limited evidence of its effectiveness in reducing health care professionals' psychological distress. This study aims to examine the effects of iACT on psychological distress (stress, anxiety, and depression) among health care professionals in China. From October 2022 to February 2023, a total of 108 health care professionals were recruited via WeChat and randomized into a 6-week iACT intervention program with therapist support (n=54) or waitlist control group (n=54). The intervention included 21 self-guided sessions combining teaching videos, mindfulness practices, and journal writing, followed by 7 live conferences to share experiences and discuss questions, all conducted via WeChat. Primary outcomes (stress, anxiety, and depression) and secondary outcomes (burnout and psychological flexibility) were collected using the Sojump platform, the most popular web-based survey platform in China. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare the outcomes between groups and assess the effects of group, time, and group-by-time interaction. Subgroup and sensitive analyses were performed to test the robustness of our findings across various groups. Among the 108 health care professionals, 68 (63%) completed the follow-up assessment at week 10, including 35 (64.8%) in the iACT group and 33 (61.1%) in the waitlist control group. Of the 54 participants in the iACT group, all attended at least 2 sessions, and 25 attended all 28 sessions. On average, participants attended 20 (71%) sessions. The iACT group showed significant improvement in the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 total score (d=0.82, 95% CI 0.39-1.26), and the effects were sustained for 4 weeks after the intervention (d=1.08, 95% CI 0.57-1.59). Compared to the control group, the iACT group showed significantly lower scores in burnout at week 6 (d=1.42, 95% CI 0.95-1.89) and week 10 (d=1.52, 95% CI 0.98-2.06). The iACT group showed significantly higher psychological flexibility at week 6 (d=1.23, 95% CI 0.77-1.69) and week 10 (d=1.15, 95% CI 0.64-1.66). The iACT effectively decreased health care professionals' psychological distress and burnout and improved their psychological flexibility. Our findings provide implications and guidance for the development and broad implementation of iACT in health care settings to improve the mental health of health care professionals.
