Study Title: Acute physiological responses of blood flow restriction between high-intensity interval repetitions in trained cyclists.

Study Summary:
Blood flow restriction (BFR) is increasingly being used to enhance aerobic performance in endurance athletes. This study examined physiological responses to BFR applied in recovery phases within a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session in trained cyclists. Eleven competitive road cyclists (mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD, age: 28&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7&#xa0;years, body mass: 69&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6&#xa0;kg, peak oxygen uptake: 65&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9&#xa0;mL &#xb7;&#xa0;kg&#xa0;&#xb7; min) completed two randomised crossover conditions: HIIT with (BFR) and without (CON) BFR applied during recovery phases. HIIT consisted of six 30-s cycling bouts at an intensity equivalent to 85% of maximal 30-s power (523&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;93&#xa0;W), interspersed with 4.5-min recovery. BFR (200&#xa0;mmHg, 12&#xa0;cm cuff width) was applied for 2-min in the early recovery phase between each interval. Pulmonary gas exchange (V&#x307;O, V&#x307;CO, and V&#x307;E), tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI), heart rate (HR), and serum vascular endothelial growth factor concentration (VEGF) were measured. Compared to CON, BFR increased V&#x307;COand V&#x307;E during work bouts (both p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05, dz&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.5), but there was no effect on V&#x307;O, TSI, or HR (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). In early recovery, BFR decreased TSI, V&#x307;O, V&#x307;CO, and V&#x307;E (all p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05, dz&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.8) versus CON, with no change in HR (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). In late recovery, when BFR was released, V&#x307;O, V&#x307;CO, V&#x307;E, and HR increased, but TSI decreased versus CON (all p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05, dz&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.8). There was a greater increase in VEGF at 3-h post-exercise in BFR compared to CON (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05, dz&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.8). Incorporating BFR into HIIT recovery phases altered physiological responses compared to exercise alone.
