Study Title: Psychophysiological responses to a multimodal physiotherapy program in fighter pilots with flight-related neck pain: A pilot trial.

Study Summary:
The physical and cognitive demands of combat flying may influence the development and persistence of flight-related neck pain (FRNP). The aim of this pilot study was to analyse the effect of a multimodal physiotherapy program which combined supervised exercise with laser-guided feedback and interferential current therapy on psychophysiological variables in fighter pilots with FRNP. Thirty-one fighter pilots were randomly assigned to two groups (Intervention Group: n = 14; Control Group: n = 17). The intervention consisted of 8 treatment sessions (twice per week) delivered over 4 weeks. The following primary outcomes were assessed: perceived pain intensity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale-NPRS) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV; time-domain, frequency-domain and non-linear variables). A number of secondary outcomes were also assessed: myoelectric activity of the upper trapezius and sternocleidomastoid, pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale-PCS) and kinesiophobia (TSK-11). Statistically significant differences (p&#x2264;0.05) within and between groups were observed for all outcomes except for frequency domain and non-linear HRV variables. A significant time*group effect (one-way ANOVA) in favour of the intervention group was found for all variables (p<0.001). Effect sizes were large (d&#x2265;0.6). The use of a multimodal physiotherapy program consisting of supervised exercise with laser-guided feedback and interferential current appears to show clinical benefit in fighter pilots with FRNP.
