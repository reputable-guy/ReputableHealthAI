Study Title: Primary Care Provider and Staff Wellness and Burnout Levels and Suggestions to Improve Wellness: Analysis of Survey Findings.

Study Summary:
Primary care provider and staff burnout is high, although less research exists comparing burnout by role. The objectives of this study were to characterize primary care provider and staff wellness and burnout and provide suggestions to improve wellness in a large network. Survey items included demographics, the Perceived Stress Reactivity Subscale, abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory, Mini-Z burnout survey, self-reported wellness, and one open-ended question asking what would improve their work-related wellness. Surveys were disseminated in February 2021, October 2021, and June 2022. Responses were analyzed by demographic categories. Open-ended responses were coded. In total 1015 responses were recorded (29.5% response rate). Burnout varied by role and campus. The 677 open-ended comments had six main themes for improving wellness: Staffing, Health System, Practice, Training, Incentives, and Miscellaneous. Primary care providers/staff reported varying, consistent levels of burnout. They suggested practice and system-level changes including increased staffing, schedule changes and improved communication.
