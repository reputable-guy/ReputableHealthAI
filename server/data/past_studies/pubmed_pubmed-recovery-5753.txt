Study Title: A Comparison Between Fondaparinux Sodium and Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin in Preventing Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement from Deep Vein Thrombosis.

Study Summary:
Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a highly successful and effective surgery for improving hip functions and relieving pain. However, the lower extremities are prone to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and swelling after surgery, thereby delaying recovery. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of fondaparinux sodium (FS) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on DVT of the lower extremity after THA. Firstly, 60 patients who underwent THA at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College from March 2020 to December 2020 were included. Next, the patients were randomly divided into an LMWH group (n = 30) and an FS group (n = 30). Then, the indexes related to DVT were compared between both groups. Specifically, the differences in baseline data, such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI), between the two groups were not statistically significant. The postoperative weight bearing time of patients in the FS group was much shorter than that in the LMWH group. Subcutaneous injection of FS not only exhibits superior effects to LMWH in preventing DVT after THA but also has a correlation with reducing the risk of thrombosis and improving patient symptoms.
