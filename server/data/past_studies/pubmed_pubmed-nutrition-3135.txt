Study Title: From womb to wellness: early environmental exposures, cord blood DNA methylation and disease origins.

Study Summary:
Fetal exposures can induce epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, potentially predisposing individuals to later health issues. Cord blood (CB) DNA methylation provides a unique window into the fetal epigenome, reflecting the intrauterine environment's impact. Maternal factors, including nutrition, smoking and toxin exposure, can alter CB DNA methylation patterns, associated with conditions from obesity to neurodevelopmental disorders. These epigenetic changes underscore prenatal exposures' enduring effects on health trajectories. Technical challenges include tissue specificity issues, limited coverage of current methylation arrays and confounding factors like cell composition variability. Emerging technologies, such as single-cell sequencing, promise to overcome some of these limitations. Longitudinal studies are crucial to elucidate exposure-epigenome interactions and develop prevention strategies. Future research should address these challenges, advance public health initiatives to reduce teratogen exposure and consider ethical implications of epigenetic profiling. Progress in CB epigenetics research promises personalized medicine approaches, potentially transforming our understanding of developmental programming and offering novel interventions to promote lifelong health from the earliest stages of life.
