Study Title: Assessment of Dependency in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and its Predictors: A Cross-Sectional Study among the Elderly Rural Population in a Sub-Himalayan UT of India.

Study Summary:
With an increase in life expectancy over the last few decades, there has been a parallel increase in the prevalence of disabilities among the elderly population. To estimate the prevalence of dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) and its predictors among the rural elderly population. This was a cross-sectional study carried out in the community among the rural geriatric population in the field practice area of PG Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College Jammu. The Barthel Scale Index was used to measure ADL dependency. PSPP software was used to analyze the data. The mean age of study participants was 68.31 &#xb1; 7.9 years. ADL dependency was observed in 46.3% of the subjects, with the majority demonstrating mild to moderate dependence. Only 2.5% of the respondents reported a severe degree of ADL dependence. The mean ADL score was 94.47 &#xb1; 8.98. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, educational status, the presence of stress in the family, personal history, and the presence of co-morbidities emerged to be independent predictors of ADL dependence. High prevalence of physical disability in the geriatric population is now an area of major concern. This emphasizes the significance of setting up geriatric care centers especially in rural areas preferably integrating with health and wellness centers.
