Study Title: P6 acupressure versus sham acupressure for prevention of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV) are common during cesarean delivery (CD) with neuraxial anesthesia. Limited information exists on the antiemetic benefit of combined P6 acupoint stimulation with acupressure (P6 acupressure) and pharmacologic antiemetics on preventing IONV and PONV after CD. This study assessed the antiemetic efficacy of P6 acupressure compared to a non-P6 acupoint stimulation with acupressure (sham acupressure) in preventing IONV during CD. We performed a randomized double-blinded trial comparing the efficacy of intraprocedural P6 acupressure versus sham acupressure in preventing IONV during CD after following the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology enhanced recovery recommendations. Subjects were instructed to apply additional pressure at the acupressure sites when they perceived nausea. The primary outcome was the incidence of IONV, and the secondary outcome was the need for rescue antiemetic treatment. Ninety-nine P6 acupressure and 100 sham acupressure subjects were studied. There was no difference in the incidence of intraoperative nausea (67%), vomiting (17%), emesis episodes, or the need for rescue antiemetics intraoperatively. There were also no differences in the incidence of PONV and antiemetic treatment from PACU to discharge. At discharge, 70% of respondents reported experiencing nausea, but only 10% reported it affected self-care. Approximately 50% of the patients in both groups were satisfied with acupressure therapy. P6 acupressure did not reduce the incidence of IONV or PONV when combined with antiemetic therapy per enhanced recovery recommendations. There does not appear to be sufficient evidence to support using P6 acupressure for IONV prevention.
