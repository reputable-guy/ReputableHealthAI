Study Title: Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase as stress markers to evaluate an individualized music intervention for people with dementia: feasibility and pilot analyses.

Study Summary:
We investigated salivary biomarkers of stress, more specifically, cortisol and alpha-amylase, to evaluate effects of individualized music listening (IML) in people with dementia. Participants were N&#x2009;=&#x2009;64 nursing home residents with dementia (mean= 83.53&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.71 years, 68.8% female). Participants were randomly assigned to either listening to their favorite music every other day for a period of six weeks (intervention), or standard care (control). Using the Saliva Children`s Swab (SCS), saliva was collected before, after, and 20&#xa0;min after IML sessions at the beginning and end of the intervention period for the analysis of salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol. Using the SCS was feasible in people with dementia. Nevertheless, there was no effect of IML on salivary stress markers. Although using SCS was feasible, active patient engagement is required. Future studies need to corroborate findings in larger samples. German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00015641, ISRCTN registry: ISRCTN59052178.
