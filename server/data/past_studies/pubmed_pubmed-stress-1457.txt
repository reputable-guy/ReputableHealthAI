Study Title: A survey of the members of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons and factors associated with well-being.

Study Summary:
The goal of this study was to survey the members of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons (ASPN) to assess the prevalence and associated risks of burnout among pediatric neurosurgeons. The authors aimed to identify the factors that most significantly contributed to this risk to provide a baseline group of characteristics to improve physician well-being. Institutional Review Board approval from the University of Arizona was obtained, and the 7-question and 9-question Mayo Physician Well-Being Index (WBI) was distributed to members of the ASPN (n = 275). This index screens for many different aspects of distress for physicians, including burnout risk, stress, depression, fatigue, suicidal ideation, and low career satisfaction. An analysis of 111 pediatric neurosurgeons (111/275 [40% response rate]) was completed. Respondent ages were distributed, with those aged 56-60 years representing the highest proportion (20%). University practice represented a majority (72%). One-third (32%) of respondents reported practicing greater than 25 years, and most physicians in the survey were married (76%). One-third of surgeons spend 61-70 hours working per week (33%), and a plurality are on call between 6 and 10 days per month (42%). Most surgeons reported treating fewer than 200 cases per year (37% reported 100-150 cases; 23%, 151-200). Most pediatric neurosurgeons (63%) stated their annual salary was sufficient. Analysis of each WBI question was performed to identify which factors specifically contributed to the risk of burnout. An overwhelming majority of respondents reported that they make significant efforts to do at least one thing each week that brings them joy (97%), and they either agree or strongly agree that they perform meaningful work (98% of all participants, 97% of females, and 98% of men, p = 0.010). Nearly half of all respondents (49%) reported feelings of burnout and a majority of them were female (67% of women and 42% of men, p = 0.021). Time, environment, case volumes, and quality-of-life concerns are all factors that significantly contribute to the overall risk of burnout and well-being. This survey study of the ASPN membership revealed a 49% rate of burnout with females at higher risk (67%). Factors associated with burnout were salary, more than 10 days on call per month, electronic medical record stressors, and work-life incongruity. The aforementioned notwithstanding, respondents believe pediatric neurosurgery is a meaningful career. This study provides evidence supporting a moral imperative toward recognition of burnout symptoms and a pivot point toward implementing change.
