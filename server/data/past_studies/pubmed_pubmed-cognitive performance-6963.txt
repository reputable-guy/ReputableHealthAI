Study Title: Cognitive Performance of Users Is Affected by Electronic Handovers Depending on Role, Task and Human Factors.

Study Summary:
Patient handovers are cognitively demanding, crucial for information continuity and patient safety, but error prone. This study investigated the effect of an electronic handover tool, i.e. the handoverEHR, on the memory and care planning performance of nurse students (n=32) in a randomised, controlled cross-over design with the factors handover task and handover role. On a descriptive level, handover recipients could improve their memory performance with electronic support, handover givers their performance of writing care plans. Statistically meaningful differences occurred, however, only when the participants were givers. Without handover experience and with low fluency to word problems, givers performed badly in the most demanding of the handover tasks. Final recommendations, however, can only be made after replicating this study in a clinical setting with mixed groups.
