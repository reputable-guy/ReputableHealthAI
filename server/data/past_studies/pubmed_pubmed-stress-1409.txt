Study Title: Evaluation of Comparative Efficacy of Levothyroxine Versus Kshar Basti and Kanchanar Guggul in the Treatment of Hypothyroidism: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The thyroid gland is an endocrine gland that has an impact on the body's general metabolism. Thus, the secretions of the thyroid gland can modify the overall metabolism of the entire body. The prevalence of hypothyroidism is increasing quickly, with rates of 2%-5% in affluent countries and 11% in India. Individuals diagnosed with hypothyroidism need to take medication for the rest of their lives, resulting in significant stress. Therefore, conducting a study in this area is imperative. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the therapeutic enema (Kshar Basti) and oral Kanchanar Guggul in the treatment of hypothyroidism. The trial group (n=45) will receive a therapeutic enema (Kshar Basti) followed by oral Ayurvedic drugs for 180 days. The control group (n=45) will be given levothyroxine tablets at a dosage of 1.6 &#xb5;g/kg/day for the same duration. The objective is to examine the alterations in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels before and after the treatment. Any deviation of the serum TSH by more than 20% from the initial values, while keeping triiodothyronine (T), and thyroxine (T) levels within the normal range, will be deemed statistically significant. Consequently, we anticipate a statistically significant variation in serum TSH levels between the therapeutic enema and Kanchanar Guggul treatments. Presently, the drug preparation operations are in progress. We expect to start enrolling patients in June 2024, do data analysis in December 2025, and acquire results by early 2026, marking the end of this trial. This study will evaluate the efficacy of the therapeutic enema, specifically Kshar Basti, in treating hypothyroidism. Furthermore, more research can determine the efficacy of a therapeutic enema (Kshar Basti) in treating overt hypothyroidism and hypothyroidism during pregnancy.
