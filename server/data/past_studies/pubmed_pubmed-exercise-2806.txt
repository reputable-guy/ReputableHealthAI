Study Title: Six weeks of a concurrent training therapy improves endothelial function and arterial stiffness in hypertensive adults with minimum non-responders.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to examine the effects of a six-week of concurrent training using high-intensity interval plus resistance training on flow-mediated dilation and pulse wave velocity in hypertensive, elevated blood pressure, or normotensive. A secondary goal was to analyze the inter-individual variability. A randomized controlled clinical trial was executed with 60 adult participants distributed across six groups: three control groups of hypertensive, elevated blood pressure, or normotensive and other three experimental hypertensive, elevated blood pressure, and normotensive groups, each comprising n=10 individuals. Participants underwent a six-week intervention of concurrent exercise using high-intensity interval plus resistance training three-weekly. Flow mediated dilation and pulse wave velocity and secondary vascular assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. The hypertensive exercise group exhibited a significant increase in flow mediated dilation (&#x394;+7.7%; p=0.003) and a reduction in pulse wave velocity (&#x394;-1.2ms; p<0.0001). The normotensive exercise group also showed a significant increase in flow mediated dilation (&#x394;+8.4%, p=0.002). The six-week concurrent exercise using high-intensity interval plus resistance training protocol, characterized by its clinical time-efficiency, was effective in improving endothelial function, as demonstrated by increased flow mediated dilation, and in reducing arterial stiffness, indicated by decreased pulse wave velocity.
