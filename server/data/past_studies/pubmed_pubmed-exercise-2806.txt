Study Title: Effect of neck-specific exercises with and without internet support on cervical range of motion and neck muscle endurance in chronic whiplash-associated disorders: analysis of functional outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To compare the effects of a neck-specific exercise programme with internet support and 4 physiotherapist sessions (NSEIT) and the same neck-specific exercises supervised by a physiotherapist (NSE) on neck muscle endurance and cervical range of motion. Randomized controlled trial. A total of 140 participants with chronic whiplash-associated disorders grade II or grade III were randomly assigned to the NSEIT or NSE groups. Outcomes were changes in active cervical range of motion, cranio-cervical flexion test, neck muscle endurance, and neck pain, at 3- and 15-month follow-ups. There were no significant differences between the NSEIT and NSE groups. There was a significant group-by-time inter-action effect in active cervical range of motion flexion/extension where the NSEIT group improved to 3-month follow-up, but the NSE group did not. Both groups were significantly improved over time in all other outcomes (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) at 3- and 15-month follow-ups, with effect size between 0.64 and 1.35 in active cervical range of motion, cranio-cervical flexion test, dorsal neck muscle endurance, and neck pain, and effect size between 0.22 and 0.42 in ventral neck muscle endurance. Both NSE and NSEIT led to improved neck function. Depending on the patients' needs, either NSE or NSEIT could be used as treatment for patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders.
