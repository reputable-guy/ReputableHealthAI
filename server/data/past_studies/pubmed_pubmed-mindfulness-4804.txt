Study Title: Emotional eating in women with generalized anxiety disorder.

Study Summary:
Individuals diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) seek pleasurable foods to avoid their negative emotional experiences. Ineffective regulation of negative emotions may be a risk factor for emotional eating (EE), leading to suffering, dysfunctional behaviors, and weight gain. The aim of this study is to understand the relationship between emotional dysregulation and EE, investigating potential mediators such as the intensity of the worry, avoidance of internal experiences, mindfulness, and self-compassion in female patients with anxiety. In this cross-sectional study, participants from a randomized clinical trial diagnosed with GAD answered the following instruments at baseline: the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Action and Acceptance Questionnaire (AAQ), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). We estimated Pearson correlation coefficients and performed mediation analyses. We evaluated 51 female individuals, 34 of whom completed all the questionnaires. Our data showed that EE was positively correlated with emotional dysregulation (r = 0.593; p < 0.001), worry trait (r = 0.402; p = 0.018), and avoidance of internal experiences (r = 0.565; p < 0.001), whereas it was negatively correlated with self-compassion (r = -0.590; p < 0.001) and mindful state (r = -0.383; p = 0.026). Moreover, we demonstrated that self-compassion mediates the relationship between emotional dysregulation and EE (ab product estimate = 0.043, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.003-0.084). Our findings contribute to the literature by identifying psychological factors that could mediate the association between emotional dysregulation and EE, enabling identification of more effective eating behavior intervention targets for patients with GAD.
