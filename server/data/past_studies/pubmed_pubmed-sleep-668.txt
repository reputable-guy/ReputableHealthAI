Study Title: Emerging From the Haze&#x2122;: Pilot Feasibility Study Comparing Two Virtual Formats of a Cognitive Rehabilitation Intervention.

Study Summary:
To gather feasibility and preliminary data comparing two virtual delivery methods for providing Emerging From the Haze&#x2122; (Haze) to cancer survivors compared to waitlist control (WLC). Eligible participants (N = 93) reported cancer-related cognitive impairment following chemotherapy for stage I-III solid tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A three-arm randomized design was used to compare virtual live group presentation of Haze sessions, virtual prerecorded Haze group sessions, and WLC. Data were collected at baseline, week 10, and week 14. Feasibility was demonstrated. Significant cognitive function improvement at week 10 versus WLC was reported for the live group, and clinical improvement was reported for the prerecorded group. The prerecorded group reported significant improvement at week 14 versus WLC in physical activity, sleep, and health-related quality of life. Additional pilot and feasibility evidence for cognitive rehabilitation interventions was demonstrated. Prerecorded Haze delivery shows potential for clinical effectiveness and scalability. Future multisite research is warranted.
