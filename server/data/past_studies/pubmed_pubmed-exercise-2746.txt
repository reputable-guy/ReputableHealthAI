Study Title: The effect of a combined cooling intervention on cognitive function in the heat during an intermittent running protocol.

Study Summary:
Despite optimal cognitive function being essential for performance, there is a lack of research on the effectiveness of combined cooling interventions on team sport athlete's cognitive function when exercising in the heat. In a randomised, crossover design, 12 unacclimatised men (age: 22.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.0&#xa0;years, body mass: 73.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;kg, height: 181.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;cm andmax: 51.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9.5&#xa0;mL/kg/min) participated in a control (CON) and combined cooling trial (ice slurry and ice collar; COOL). A battery of cognitive tests were completed prior to, during (at half-time) and following a 90-min intermittent running protocol in the heat (33&#xb0;C, 50% relative humidity (RH)). Perceptual and physiological measures were taken throughout the protocol. In CON, response times were quicker on the Stroop task complex level (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002) and the visual search test complex level at full-time (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014) compared to COOL. During COOL, response times were quicker at half-time on the Stroop task complex level (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024) compared to CON. Lower rectal temperatures were seen during COOL (CON: 37.44&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.65&#xb0;C and COOL: 37.28&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.68&#xb0;C) as well as lower skin, neck and forehead temperatures (main effect of trial, all p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Lower ratings of thermal sensation and perceived exertion and enhanced thermal comfort were recorded during COOL (main effect of trial, all p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Whilst minimal differences in cognitive function were found when using the combined cooling intervention, the findings highlight a practical and effective strategy to improving many physiological and perceptual responses to intermittent exercise in the heat.
