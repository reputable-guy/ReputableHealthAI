Study Title: Clinical study of the effect of mometasone furoate nasal spray treatment on hearing and in secretory otitis media in children.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of Mometasone furoate (Elocon Cream) Nasal Spray (MFNS) treatment on hearing secretory Otitis Media (SOM) in younger children. Seventy-six children with SOM (ages 5 to 10 years-old) were selected as study subjects and divided into two groups of 38 cases each using a randomized numerical table. The control group was given conventional treatment, and the observation group was treated with MFNS based on the control group. Both groups were treated for 12 weeks. The improvements in clinical symptoms and hearing were compared between the two groups at weeks 4, 8 and 12 of treatment, respectively. The total effective rate of treatment in the observation group was higher than that in the control group. The middle ear resonance frequency of the children in the observation group was higher than that of the control group at weeks 4, 8 and 12 of treatment, and the air-conduction hearing threshold was lower than that of the control group. The total effective rate of the observation group after 12-weeks of treatment was 92.11 %, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (73.68 %). In addition, the T-ETDQ score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group after treatment. MFNS has clinical efficacy in the treatment of SOM in young children, which can improve clinical symptoms, promote the recovery of hearing and eustachian tube function, reduce the local inflammatory response, and improve immune function.
