Study Title: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of an Evidence-Based iPad-App for Cognitive Rehabilitation in Patients with Primary Brain Tumors.

Study Summary:
Many patients with primary brain tumors suffer from cognitive deficits, which negatively impact their quality of life. However, cognitive rehabilitation programs for these patients are scarce. We developed an iPad-based cognitive rehabilitation program for brain tumor patients, which was based on our effective face-to-face cognitive rehabilitation program. After successful completion of a feasibility study, a randomized controlled trial has been started. To evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of the iPad-based program on cognitive performance and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in patients with primary brain tumors in an early stage of the disease. Prior to surgery, patients with presumed low-grade glioma and meningioma are included. Before surgery and 3 mo after surgery, neuropsychological assessments are conducted. After the second neuropsychological assessment, patients are assigned to the intervention group or waiting-list control group. The intervention consists of psychoeducation, compensation training, and retraining. Patients are advised to spend 3 h per week on the program for 10 wk. Immediately after completion of the program and a half-year thereafter, postintervention assessments take place. Patients in the control group are offered the opportunity to follow the program after all study assessments. We expect that early cognitive rehabilitation has beneficial effects on cognitive performance and PROMs in brain tumor patients. The iPad-based program allows brain tumor patients to follow a cognitive rehabilitation program from their homes. Forthcoming results may contribute to further improvement of supportive care for brain tumor patients.
