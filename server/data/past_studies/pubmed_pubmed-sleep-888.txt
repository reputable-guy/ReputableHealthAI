Study Title: Comparison of dolutegravir and efavirenz on depression, anxiety and sleep disorders in pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV.

Study Summary:
Both dolutegravir and efavirenz are known to be effective in pregnancy and postpartum to prevent vertical transmission of HIV and to maintain maternal health. Both drugs have also been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. To what extent, these symptoms occur in pregnant and postpartum women, however, is not yet known. This was a secondary analysis of the DolPHIN2 study, a multicentre randomized trial among women presenting late in pregnancy with untreated HIV - who received either a dolutegravir-containing or efavirenz-containing regimen. Longitudinal measures of depression, anxiety and sleep quality were analysed during pregnancy and up to 48&#x200a;weeks postpartum. Among 268 women, median (IQR) Edinburgh Post Natal Depression Score (EPDS) scores were 8 (3-11) and highest at enrolment. In the dolutegravir and efavirenz arm, respectively, 23.7 and 25.6% had an EPDS score above 9, indicating possible or probable depression. Abnormal Hospital Anxiety Depression scores (HADS) (above 11) were seen at least once during follow-up in 42 of patients (15.7%), although no differences were seen between treatment arms. No association was found between EPDS, suicidality and HADS scores and the assigned regimen ( P &#x200a;=&#x200a;0.93, 0.97 and 0.18 respectively). Median (IQR) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) scores for dolutegravir and efavirenz were 6 (5-7) and 5 (5-6.5), respectively, P &#x200a;=&#x200a;0.70. No statistically significant differences were observed between efavirenz-containing or dolutegravir-containing regimens. Rates of depression were high, but decreased over the course of time and confirm the need for psychological support after initial HIV diagnosis in pregnancy.
