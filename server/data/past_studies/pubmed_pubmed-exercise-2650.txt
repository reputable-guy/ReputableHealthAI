Study Title: Effects of isolated and combined mental and physical fatigue on motor skill and endurance exercise performance.

Study Summary:
Mental fatigue, elicited by cognitive demands, can impair sport and exercise performance. The effects of isolated mental fatigue on performance are well documented but few studies have explored the effects of combined mental and physical fatigue on skilled motor and endurance exercise performance. This study explored the effects of isolated mental, isolated physical, and combined (mental plus physical) fatigue on skill and exercise task performance. 164 athletes were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: mental fatigue, physical fatigue, combined fatigue, control (no fatigue). Mental fatigue was induced by a 15-min time-load dual-back cognitive task. Physical fatigue was induced by a 90-s burpee exercise task. Next, all participants completed a throwing skill task and performed burpee exercises to failure. Objective (brief Psychomotor Vigilance Task, PVT-B) and subjective (self-report) measures of mental fatigue and Ratings of Perceived Exertion were obtained throughout. The mental fatigue and combined fatigue groups performed the worst on both the throwing and burpee tasks compared with the physical fatigue and control groups. The former reported higher mental fatigue throughout and had worse response accuracy and variation on the end-of-session PVT-B task. The combined fatigue group performed better than the mental fatigue group on the throwing and burpee tasks. A demanding cognitive task induced a state of mental fatigue and impaired skill and endurance performance. Mental fatigue alone was more detrimental than combined fatigue to skill and endurance performance, suggesting that the physical activity manipulation reduced the negative effects of mental fatigue on performance.
