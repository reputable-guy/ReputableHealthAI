Study Title: Effects of consecutive bed bathing with weak versus ordinary pressure on skin barrier recovery of hospitalised older adults: A within-person randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Wiping pressure (WP [mmHg]) during bed baths is essential to maintain skin integrity and care quality for older adults. However, effects of different wiping pressures on skin barrier recovery over multiple days remain unclear. This study evaluated and compared the effects of consecutive bed bathing with weak pressure and that with ordinary pressure on skin barrier recovery of hospitalised older adults. This within-person, randomised, controlled trial involved 254 forearms (127 patients) and was conducted at a general hospital. Forearms were blinded and randomly assigned a site and sequence of two bed bathing sessions: wiping three times with weak (10&#x2264;WP<20) and ordinary pressure (20&#x2264;WP<30) once per day for 2 consecutive days. The skin barrier was assessed daily based on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH) before and 15&#xa0;min after the interventions. Dry skin was assessed using the overall dry skin score. A linear mixed model showed that the time courses of TEWL and SCH differed significantly between groups. Impaired skin barrier function caused by ordinary pressure on the first day did not recover to baseline values the next day, whereas weak pressure did not cause significant changes. During subgroup analyses, TEWL of patients with dry skin was more likely to increase with ordinary pressure. Despite decreased skin barrier recovery experienced by older adults, our findings suggest the safety of weak pressure and highlight the importance of WP during bed baths. Weak pressure is particularly desirable for patients with dry skin. UMIN000048838.
