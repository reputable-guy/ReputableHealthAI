Study Title: A period of backwards walking affects the craniovertebral angle, proprioception, balance, and foot pressure on forward head posture of female students.

Study Summary:
The presence of spinal arches is crucial for maintaining good body posture, reducing pressure on joints, and preventing deformities caused by misalignment. Engaging in exercises that focus on correcting body alignment, such as walking backward, can enhance posture and various related factors. A group of 46 female students suffering from forward head posture was selected (age: 22.89&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.31 years, height: 1.63&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.05&#xa0;m, weight: 60.01&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.41&#xa0;kg, body mass index: 22.38&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.28&#xa0;kg/m2) and randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group participated in three exercise sessions per week for four weeks, while the control group did not receive any intervention during the study. Changes in the craniovertebral angle, proprioception, resistance, and foot pressure were measured using photogrammetry, head-neck angle examination with a laser pointer, a balance measuring device, and a foot scanner. The results of this study showed that the training program had a significant effect on the craniovertebral angle (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), neck proprioception (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), balance (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), and sole pressure (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). Likewise, the results of the group comparison revealed significant differences in various variables, such as the craniovertebral angle (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), neck proprioception (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), balance (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), and plantar pressure (P&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;0.05). This study demonstrated that walking backward enhanced the craniovertebral angle, proprioception, balance, and alterations in the plantar center of pressure. Therefore, this exercise is recommended as a complementary therapeutic approach for individuals with forward head posture.
