Study Title: Physical and psychological effects of neuromuscular integrative activity vs Pilates on sedentary females.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Neuromuscular Integrative Action (NIA) and Pilates exercises on physical fitness and psychological effects in sedentary women. The groups were randomly divided into Pilates (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;22) and NIA (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;21) groups using the closed envelope method. 43 sedentary women aged 20-45 years were included in the study. The 6 Minute Walking Test (6MWT), the Sit and Reach Test, and the Static Plank Test durations were used for the physical fitness level assessment at baseline and at the end of trainings. In addition, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the SF-36 were used to evaluate the psycho-somatic symptoms and health-related quality of life of the participants. Both groups received 60-min exercise sessions 2 days a week for 8 weeks. After treatment, within comparisons revealed that there was a significant improvement in BMI (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008), 6MWT (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0001), Sit and Reach Test (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.016), Static Plank Test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.000), and SF-36 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.017) values in the NIA group. Additionally, BMI (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.038), 6-min Walk Test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0001), Sit and Reach test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001), Static Plank test (0.000), Functional Reach distance (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.06), Beck Depression Scale, and SF-36 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006) scores improved in comparisons made within the Pilates group after treatment. Between group comparisons showed similar result for all variables in both Pilates and NIA groups. Based on the results of this study, NIA may be an alternative to Pilates for improving the physical fitness level and psychological effects in healthy women.
