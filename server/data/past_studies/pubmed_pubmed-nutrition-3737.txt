Study Title: Collagen peptides supplementation improves function, pain, and physical and mental outcomes in active adults.

Study Summary:
Chronic pain affects 19% of adults in the United States, with increasing prevalence in active and aging populations. Pain can limit physical activity and activities of daily living (ADLs), resulting in declined mental and social health. Nutritional interventions for pain currently target inflammation or joint health, but few influence both. Collagen, the most abundant protein in the human body and constituent of the extra cellular matrix, is such a nutraceutical. While there have been reports of reductions in pain with short-term collagen peptide (CP) supplementation, there are no long-term studies specifically in healthy middle-aged active adults. To determine the effects of daily CP consumption over 3, 6, and 9&#x2009;months on survey measures of pain, function, and physical and mental health using The Knee Injury & Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) and Veterans Rand 12 (VR-12) in middle-aged active adults. This study was a double-blind randomized control trial with three treatment groups (Placebo, 10&#x2009;g/d CP, and 20&#x2009;g/d CP). Improvements in ADLs (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.031, &#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.096) and pain (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.037, &#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.164) were observed with 10&#x2009;g/d CP over 6&#x2009;months, although pain only improved in high frequency exercisers (>180&#x2009;min/week). Additionally, VR-12 mental component scores (MCS) improved with 10&#x2009;g/d of CP over 3-9&#x2009;months (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.017, &#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.309), while physical component scores (PCS) improved with 20&#x2009;g/d of CP over 3-9&#x2009;months, but only in females (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.013, &#x3b7;= .582). These findings suggest 10 to 20&#x2009;g/d of CP supplementation over 6 to 9&#x2009;months may improve ADLs, pain, MCS, and PCS in middle-aged active adults.
