Study Title: Effect Of Listening To Music On Mother's Non-Stress Test Results and Anxiety Levels.

Study Summary:
The non-stress test (NST) is one of the most common tests used to assess fetal well-being. The NST, based on the evaluation of a fetus's oxygenation status, is widely used because it is non-invasive and easy to interpret. The study was aimed at determining the effect of music listened to by pregnant women during the NST on their test results and anxiety levels. This randomized controlled study included 110 multiparous pregnant women. Of them, 55 were in the intervention group and 55 were in the control group. The pregnant women in the intervention group listened to music during the NST procedure. The data were collected using the Pregnant Woman Information Form and the NST Follow-up. The form was developed based on pertinent literature, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure the state anxiety levels of pregnant women before and after the NST procedure. It was observed that music increased the acceleration number and reactive NST ratio of pregnant women and reduced their anxiety levels. It is recommended that midwives/nurses should play music in the follow-up and care of pregnant women in the clinic and NST polyclinic.
