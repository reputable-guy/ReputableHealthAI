Study Title: Jumping Exercise Combined With Collagen Supplementation Preserves Bone Mineral Density in Elite Cyclists.

Study Summary:
This study assessed the effect of combined jump training and collagen supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) in elite road-race cyclists. In this open-label, randomized study with two parallel groups, 36 young (21 &#xb1; 3&#xa0;years) male (n = 8) and female (n = 28) elite road-race cyclists were allocated to either an intervention (INT: n = 18) or a no-treatment control (CON: n = 18) group. The 18-week intervention period, conducted during the off-season, comprised five 5-min bouts of jumping exercise per week, with each bout preceded by the ingestion of 15&#xa0;g hydrolyzed collagen. Before and after the intervention, BMD of various skeletal sites and trabecular bone score of the lumbar spine were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, along with serum bone turnover markers procollagen Type I N propeptide and carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of Type I collagen. BMD of the femoral neck decreased in CON (from 0.789 &#xb1; 0.104 to 0.774 &#xb1; 0.095 g/cm2), while being preserved in INT (from 0.803 &#xb1; 0.058 to 0.809 &#xb1; 0.066&#xa0;g/cm2; Time &#xd7; Treatment, p < .01). No differences between treatments were observed for changes in BMD at the total hip, lumbar spine, and whole body (Time &#xd7; Treatment, p > .05 for all). Trabecular bone score increased from 1.38 &#xb1; 0.08 to 1.40 &#xb1; 0.09 in CON and from 1.46 &#xb1; 0.08 to 1.47 &#xb1; 0.08 in INT, respectively (time effect: p < .01), with no differences between treatments (Time &#xd7; Treatment: p = .33). Serum procollagen Type I N propeptide concentrations decreased to a similar extent in CON (83.6 &#xb1; 24.8 to 71.4 &#xb1; 23.1&#xa0;ng/ml) and INT (82.8 &#xb1; 30.7 to 66.3 &#xb1; 30.6; time effect, p < .001; Time &#xd7; Treatment, p = .22). Serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of Type I collagen concentrations did not change over time, with no differences between treatments (time effect, p = .08; Time &#xd7; Treatment, p = .58). In conclusion, frequent short bouts of jumping exercise combined with collagen supplementation beneficially affects femoral neck BMD in elite road-race cyclists.
