Study Title: Randomized trial of early exercise rehabilitation and its effects on patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Study Summary:
To assess the psychological and physiological benefits of early exercise rehabilitation in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Among 559 ACS-diagnosed patients at Fuzhou University Affiliated Provincial Hospital from January to December 2021, 200 eligible participants were assigned to two groups. The control group received standard care, while the experimental group received early exercise rehabilitation in addition to standard care. The outcomes measured included changes in depression levels (PHQ-9), fasting blood glucose, and troponin I (TnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with t tests and chi-square tests for group comparisons. In comparison to the control group, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in PHQ-9 scores (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and lower fasting blood glucose levels before discharge (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046). Additionally, the experimental group had notably reduced TnI levels at 72&#xa0;h after admission (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), especially among non-diabetic NSTEMI patients over 60 years old, who showed decreased TnI levels at the 48-hour mark (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016). However, there were no significant differences in NT-ProBNP change values between the two groups (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed enhanced outcomes in the intervention group for ACS patients without smoking or drinking history and no heart failure (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025,P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014,P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018). Early exercise rehabilitation has notable benefits for ACS patients, including reduced depression, improved blood glucose control, and enhanced myocardial protection, especially in nondiabetic NSTEMI patients aged 60 and above.
