Study Title: [The intensity of neuropathic pain and the severity of insomnia in diabetic polyneuropathy].

Study Summary:
To determine the prevalence of insomnia and the effectiveness of its treatment in patients with a painful form of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). Fifty patients with the painful form of DPN were randomly divided into 2 groups: the standard therapy group (ST) and the extended therapy group (ET). In the ST group, a single lesson on sleep hygiene was conducted, in the ET group there were 3-4 face-to-face individual sessions for the treatment of insomnia for two weeks. Both groups were interviewed at the time of hospitalization, after 3 and 6 months. The severity of polyneuropathy and the nature of neuropathic pain were assessed using the Neuropathic Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) and the Neuropathy Total Symptom Score - 9 (NTSS-9); the intensity of pain was assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Sleep disorders were analyzed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Sleep disorders of varying severity were observed in 82% of patients in the initial survey. In both groups, improvement in sleep quality was noted during treatment, but significantly better results were in the ET group, the ISI score after 6 months was 7.15&#xb1;2.08 for the ST group and 3.07&#xb1;2.49 for the ET group (<0.0001). In the ST group, there was no significant decrease in the intensity of pain and the severity of polyneuropathy in dynamics. In the ET group, a significant decrease in NTSS-9 and VAS scores was found during the initial survey and after 6 months (<0.0001). The intensity of pain also significantly decreased in the ET group compared with the ST group (<0.0001) at the end of follow-up, which indicates the importance of sleep normalization in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Most patients with the painful form of DPN have insomnia. Treatment of insomnia has shown its effectiveness as part of a multimodal approach to the managing of neuropathic pain in DPN and improving the quality of life of patients.
