Study Title: Effects of nurse-led brief behavioral treatment for insomnia in adults: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
We examined the effects of nurse-led brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI) on insomnia severity, sleep status, daytime function, quality of life, psychological distress levels, treatment response, and insomnia remission in young and middle-aged Asian adults with insomnia symptoms. This 2-parallel, randomized controlled trial recruited 42 participants with insomnia symptoms randomly allocated to the nurse-led BBTI group or sleep hygiene group. The outcome measurements included the Insomnia Severity Index, sleep diary, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Brief Fatigue Inventory, RAND-36 Health Status Inventory, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. The measurement time points included baseline, the end of each week of the intervention period, and 1-month follow-up. Compared with the sleep hygiene group, participants in the BBTI group had significantly improved insomnia severity, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and the mental components of quality of life after completing nurse-led BBTI immediately and 1 month later (< .05). In addition, 52.4% and 71.4% of the participants achieved remission after completing nurse-led BBTI immediately and 1 month later, which was significantly higher than in the sleep hygiene group (14.3%,= .02; 14.3%,< .001, respectively). We suggested the relative effects of BBTI on declined insomnia severity and improved sleep status among young and middle-aged Asian adults with insomnia symptoms and confirmed the benefits of nurse-led BBTI in alleviating insomnia. Nurses should incorporate BBTI into insomnia care further to enhance the daytime function and quality of life of the population with insomnia symptoms.
