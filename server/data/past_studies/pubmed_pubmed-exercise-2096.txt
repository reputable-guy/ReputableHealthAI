Study Title: Striding beyond numbness: a non-randomized controlled study of an exercise program for breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effectiveness of a 13-week combined supervised and home-based exercise program in alleviating the symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients with breast cancer (BC). In this non-randomized controlled study, 77 patients with BC selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were allocated to the intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37) or control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) group. Patients in the intervention group underwent a 13-week exercise program consisting of health education and hand and foot exercises combined with aerobic, resistance, and balance training, while those in the control group received usual care. The symptoms of CIPN were assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3&#xa0;months post-intervention (T2). Physical fitness and finger flexibility were assessed at T0 and T1. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to analyze the repeated measures data. The results of GEE showed a significant group effect, indicating significant intergroup differences in the total CIPN score and the dimensions of occurrence, severity, disruption, and frequency (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Moreover, the two groups showed significant differences in finger flexibility and balance at T1 (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The exercise program was effective in alleviating the symptoms of CIPN and improved balance and finger dexterity in comparison with the control group. Randomized controlled trials with larger sizes are required to validate these findings.
