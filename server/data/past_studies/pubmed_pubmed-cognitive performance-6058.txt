Study Title: Cognitive Benefits of Folic Acid, Docosahexaenoic Acid, and a Combination of Both Nutrients in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Possible Alterations through Mitochondrial Function and DNA Damage.

Study Summary:
It is uncertain whether folic acid (FA) combined with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could improve cognitive performance. This study evaluated the effects of a 12-month FA and DHA supplementation, in combination or alone, on cognitive function, DNA oxidative damage, and mitochondrial function in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited MCI participants aged 60 years and older. Two hundred and eighty participants were randomly divided in equal proportion into four groups: FA + DHA (FA 800 &#x3bc;g/d + DHA 800 mg/d), FA (800 &#x3bc;g/d), DHA (800 mg/d), and placebo groups daily orally for 12 months. The primary outcome was cognitive function evaluated by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-RC). Cognitive tests and blood mechanism-related biomarkers were determined at baseline and 12 months. During the 12-month follow-up, scores of full intelligence quotient (&#x3b2;DHA: 1.302, 95% CI: 0.615, 1.990, p &lt; 0.001; &#x3b2;FA: 1.992, 95% CI: 1.304, 2.679, p &lt; 0.001; &#x3b2;FA+DHA: 2.777, 95% CI: 2.090, 3.465, p &lt; 0.001), verbal intelligence quotient, and some subtests of the WAIS-RC were significantly improved in FA + DHA and single intervention groups compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the FA and DHA intervention combination was superior to either intervention alone (p &lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, FA, DHA, and their combined use significantly decreased 8-OHdG level and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number compared to the placebo (p &lt; 0.05). Supplementation of FA and DHA, alone or combined, for 12 months can improve cognitive function in MCI participants, possibly through mitigating DNA oxidative damage and enhancing mitochondrial function. Combined supplementation may provide more cognitive benefit than supplementation alone.
