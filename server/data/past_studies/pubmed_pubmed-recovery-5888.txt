Study Title: Efficacy of Shensong Yangxin capsule combined with dronedarone in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after ablation.

Study Summary:
To investigate whether postoperative administration of Shensong Yangxin capsules (SSYX) and dronedarone for atrial fibrillation (AF) can reduce the recurrence of paroxysmal AF after radiofrequency ablation, thus providing a more optimal choice of antiarrhythmic medication during the blank period. We included 120 patients with paroxysmal AF who underwent radiofrequency ablation at our hospital between July 2020 and July 2022. They underwent routine circumferential pulmonary vein ablation and, subsequently, left and right atrial pressure monitoring to assess sinoatrial node recovery time under burst 400/300&#x2009;ms stimulation. Postoperatively, the patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (60 patients each). The control group was administered dronedarone orally for 3 months and the study group was treated with SSYX combined with dronedarone. This study aimed to compare differences in clinical efficacy of the treatment between the 2 groups. The left and right atrial pressures in both groups were higher than those in the preoperative period (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05), with no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). Sinoatrial node recovery time under burst 400/300&#x2009;ms stimulation showed no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). At 3 months and 1 year postoperatively, the AFEQT scale scores for both groups were lower than those before treatment (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05), with the study group scoring lower than the control group at 3 months (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups at 1 year postoperatively (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). At 3 months postoperatively, the sinus rhythm maintenance rate and heart rate were higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); however, these differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant at 1 year postoperatively (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). The combination of SSYX and dronedarone could effectively reduce the early recurrence of paroxysmal AF after radiofrequency ablation, increase heart rate, and improve the quality of life.
