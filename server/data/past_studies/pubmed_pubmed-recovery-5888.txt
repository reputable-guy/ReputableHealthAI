Study Title: The effectiveness of a 6-month intervention with sit-stand workstation in office workers: Results from the SUFHA cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Prolonged periods of sitting have been linked to negative health outcomes. Implementation of sit-stand desks in the workplace has been one strategy to reduce prolonged sitting. To assess the effectiveness of sit-stand workstations on reducing sitting time and improving other health outcomes of office-based workers. 39 Portuguese office workers were randomized into a 6-month parallel-group cluster RCT consisting by the implementation of sit-stand desks in the workplace. The primary outcome of sitting time was assessed using ActivPAL. Secondary outcomes included biometric, psychological, and diet-related variables. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6 months for the whole sample and at 3 months for a sub-sample of the intervention group (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;11). No significant time*group interaction was found for the primary or secondary outcomes, apart from waist circumference favoring the control group (&#x394;-1.81&#x200a;cm, pinteraction&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.04). There were significant changes within the intervention group for sitting time (-44.0&#x200a;min/day), prolonged sitting (>30&#x200a;min) (-45.3&#x200a;min/day) and standing time (51.7&#x200a;min/day) at 3 months in the sub-sample and in prolonged sitting (>30&#x200a;min) (-26&#x200a;min/day) in the full intervention group (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05). Changes were also observed within the intervention group for percent body fat (&#x394;-3.7%) and ratings of quality of life (&#x394;2.2), musculoskeletal discomfort (&#x394;-4.9), overall fatigue (&#x394;-2.2), and the need for recovery after work (&#x394;-1.7) at 6-month follow-up (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05). Although not being effective for reducing sitting time, the implementation of sit-stand desks in the Portuguese workspace was shown to be feasible over the long term, received well by users, and may offer other health benefits.
