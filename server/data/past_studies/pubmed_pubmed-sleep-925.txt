Study Title: Concentration-effect relationships of plasma caffeine on EEG delta power and cardiac autonomic activity during human sleep.

Study Summary:
Acute caffeine intake affects brain and cardiovascular physiology, yet the concentration-effect relationships on the electroencephalogram and cardiac autonomic activity during sleep are poorly understood. To tackle this question, we simultaneously quantified the plasma caffeine concentration with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, as well as the electroencephalogram, heart rate and high-frequency (0.15-0.4&#x2009;Hz) spectral power in heart rate variability, representing parasympathetic activity, with standard polysomnography during undisturbed human sleep. Twenty-one healthy young men in randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion, ingested 160&#x2009;mg caffeine or placebo in a delayed, pulsatile-release caffeine formula at their habitual bedtime, and initiated a 4-hr sleep opportunity 4.5&#x2009;hr later. The mean caffeine levels during sleep exhibited high individual variability between 0.2 and 18.4&#x2009;&#x3bc;mol&#x2005;L. Across the first two non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM)-rapid-eye-movement sleep cycles, electroencephalogram delta (0.75-2.5&#x2009;Hz) activity and heart rate were reliably modulated by waking and sleep states. Caffeine dose-dependently reduced delta activity and heart rate, and increased high-frequency heart rate variability in NREM sleep when compared with placebo. The average reduction in heart rate equalled 3.24&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.77 beats per minute. Non-linear statistical models suggest that caffeine levels above ~7.4&#x2009;&#x3bc;mol&#x2005;Ldecreased electroencephalogram delta activity, whereas concentrations above ~4.3&#x2009;&#x3bc;mol&#x2005;Land ~&#x2009;4.9&#x2009;&#x3bc;mol&#x2005;L, respectively, reduced heart rate and increased high-frequency heart rate variability. These findings provide quantitative concentration-effect relationships of caffeine, electroencephalogram delta power and cardiac autonomic activity, and suggest increased parasympathetic activity during sleep after intake of caffeine.
