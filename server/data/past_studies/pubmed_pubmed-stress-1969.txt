Study Title: Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Augmentation Therapy in Chronic Pancreatitis Patients Undergoing Total Pancreatectomy and Islet Autotransplantation: A Randomized, Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Stress-induced islet graft loss during the peri-transplantation period reduces the efficacy of islet transplantation. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of 60 mg/kg human alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) or placebo infusion weekly for four doses beginning before surgery in chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients undergoing total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation (TP-IAT). Subjects were followed for 12 months post-TP-IAT. The dose of AAT was safe, as there was no difference in the types and severity of adverse events in participants from both groups. There were some biochemical signals of treatment effect with a higher oxygen consumption rate in AAT islets before transplantation and a lower serum C-peptide (an indicator of islet death) in the AAT group at 15 min after islet infusion. Findings per the statistical analysis plan using a modified intention to treat analysis showed no difference in the C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) following a mixed meal tolerance test at 12 months post-TP-IAT. There was no difference in the secondary and exploratory outcomes. Although AAT therapy did not show improvement in C-peptide AUC in this study, AAT therapy is safe in CP patients and there are experiences gained on optimal clinical trial design in this challenging disease.
