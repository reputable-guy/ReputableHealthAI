Study Title: Virtual Wellness Workshop for Medical Students: Effects on Healthy Lifestyle Behavior.

Study Summary:
Medical students experience high levels of stress, burnout, depression, suicidal ideation, and compassion fatigue. Mindfulness interventions in this population have demonstrated improvement in psychological outcomes. However, it is unclear if these improvements are maintained. Evaluation of changes in lifestyle behaviors may provide insight into factors that sustain improvements. Specific aims of this study were to (1) assess feasibility and acceptability of an innovative, virtual program involving experiential learning, social support, and motivational interviewing; and (2) evaluate preliminary healthy lifestyle behaviors and psychological outcomes from preprogram to postprogram and 4-week follow-up. We used a mixed-methods approach to investigate feasibility, acceptability, and effects of the virtual program using validated measures and open-ended questions. Participants were 20 first- and second-year medical students at one Midwestern US medical college who participated between October 2020 and December 2020. Participants were enrolled in one of two groups for the 8-week program via Webex. Participants completed surveys at preprogram, postprogram, and 4-week follow-up. They also completed weekly home practice assessments. Nineteen of 20 participants completed the program (95% retention rate). All participants attended six or more sessions. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that participants had significant improvements in healthy lifestyle behaviors, burnout, self-compassion, and stress across time. Results were supported by qualitative themes of increased social support, wellness skills, and overall positive experiences. Findings suggest that the virtual program was feasible and acceptable to medical students, and improved healthy lifestyle behaviors and psychological outcomes that were maintained or increased at 4-week follow-up.
