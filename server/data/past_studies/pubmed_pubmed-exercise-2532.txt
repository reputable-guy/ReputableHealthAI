Study Title: Efficacy of Self-Natural Posture Exercise (SNPE) programs on chronic low back pain: A randomized controlled feasibility trial with waitlist control.

Study Summary:
Low back pain (LBP) is a significant source of disability and decreased quality of life. The Self-Natural Posture Exercise (SNPE) intervention can be used effectively in many cases, but feasibility and impact has not been fully explored. The current study explores the feasibility and efficacy of face-to-face (FtF) and virtual (Vir) SNPE programs on chronic low back pain. This is a randomized single-blinded waitlist control study with 10&#xa0;participants in the FtF group (age 45.8 &#xb1; 2.89) and 9 in the Vir group (age 52.2 &#xb1; 2.3). Participants had low to moderate low back pain for > 3&#xa0;months. Those who would eventually become the Vir group served initially as a waitlist control (Con) group. The FtF group received 12&#xa0;weeks of in-person exercise training sessions conducted and the Vir group received weekly recorded training videos created by and featuring the same instructor. Measured outcomes included feasibility assessed by rate of retention and rate of attendance, level of low back pain (Oswestry Disability Index, Visual Analogue Scale), quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey 1.0), muscular pressure pain threshold, and muscle tone. Analysis was done via repeated measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests. Rates of retention were 80% in the FtF group and 78% in the Vir group. Attendance rates were 88% in the FtF group and 60% in the Vir group. ODI, VAS, and some SF-36 domains improved in both the FtF and Vir groups. Overall, the FtF group improved in more domains and by a larger degree than the Vir group and both groups improved relative to Con. A 12-week SNPE program, done virtually or in person, shows promise in improving ODI, VAS, and some SF-36 domains. FtF appears to be more effective. Future studies would benefit from sampling a larger and more diverse population.
