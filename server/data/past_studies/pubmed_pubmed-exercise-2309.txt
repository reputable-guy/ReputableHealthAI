Study Title: Benefits of self-paced concurrent training on lung function, cardiopulmonary fitness and fatigue perception in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Study Summary:
Studying the effects of self-paced concurrent high-intensity interval training and resistance training (HIIT-RT) on respiratory function, cardiopulmonary fitness and fatigue perception in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).Twenty-three PwMS were randomized into a 12-week training group (three times per week) (TG, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11) or a control group (CG, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12). Lung function (spirometry), aerobic capacity (graded cardiopulmonary-exercise-testing) and perceived fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)) were evaluated pre- and post-intervention.The forced vital capacity (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036, Hedges'g (g)&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.93), forced expiratory time (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.045, g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.88), peak expiratory flow (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.043, g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.89) increased in TG compared with CG. The TG showed an increase in peak aerobic power (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004, g&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.34) and peak oxygen uptake (&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001, g&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.58) compared with CG. There was a decrease in ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02, g&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.02) and FSS scores (&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001, g&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.72) in TG comparatively with CG.12-week self-paced HIIT-RT enhanced lung function as well as aerobic fitness, and alleviated fatigue perception in PwMS.
