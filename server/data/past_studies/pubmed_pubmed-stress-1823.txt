Study Title: Effects of a Chatbot-Based Intervention on Stress and Health-Related Parameters in a Stressed Sample: Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Stress levels and the prevalence of mental disorders in the general population have been rising in recent years. Chatbot-based interventions represent novel and promising digital approaches to improve health-related parameters. However, there is a lack of research on chatbot-based interventions in the area of mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 3-week chatbot-based intervention guided by the chatbot ELME, specifically with respect to the ability to reduce stress and improve various health-related parameters in a stressed sample. In this multicenter two-armed randomized controlled trial, 118 individuals with medium to high stress levels were randomized to the intervention group (n=59) or the treatment-as-usual control group (n=59). The ELME chatbot guided participants of the intervention group through 3 weeks of training based on the topics stress, mindfulness, and interoception, with practical and psychoeducative elements delivered in two daily interactive intervention sessions via a smartphone (approximately 10-20 minutes each). The primary outcome (perceived stress) and secondary outcomes (mindfulness; interoception or interoceptive sensibility; subjective well-being; and emotion regulation, including the subfacets reappraisal and suppression) were assessed preintervention (T1), post intervention (T2; after 3 weeks), and at follow-up (T3; after 6 weeks). During both conditions, participants also underwent ecological momentary assessments of stress and interoceptive sensibility. There were no significant changes in perceived stress (&#x3b2;=-.018, SE=.329; P=.96) and momentary stress. Mindfulness and the subfacet reappraisal significantly increased in the intervention group over time, whereas there was no change in the subfacet suppression. Well-being and momentary interoceptive sensibility increased in both groups over time. To gain insight into how the intervention can be improved to achieve its full potential for stress reduction, besides a longer intervention duration, specific sample subgroups should be considered. The chatbot-based intervention seems to have the potential to improve mindfulness and emotion regulation in a stressed sample. Future chatbot-based studies and interventions in health care should be designed based on the latest findings on the efficacy of rule-based and artificial intelligence-based chatbots.
