Study Title: Mindfulness meditation is associated with global EEG spectral changes in theta, alpha, and beta amplitudes.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness meditation is linked to a broad range of psychological and physical health benefits, potentially mediated by changes in neural oscillations. This study explored changes in neural oscillations associated with both immediate and regular mindfulness meditation practice. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected from 40 healthy young adults (M&#xa0;=&#xa0;20.8, 24 females) during eyes-closed resting and mindfulness meditation states in two separate recording sessions, six weeks apart. Participants were novice meditators, and following the first recording session, were randomly assigned to either a daily mindfulness meditation practice or classical music listening as an active control, which they completed until the second recording session. Traditional bands of delta (1.0-3.5&#xa0;Hz), theta (4.0-7.5&#xa0;Hz), alpha (8.0-13.0&#xa0;Hz), beta (13.5-30.0&#xa0;Hz), and gamma (30.5-45.0&#xa0;Hz) were used to explore changes in global EEG spectral amplitude. A significant increase in theta between sessions was observed in both groups and states. Alpha decreased significantly during meditation compared with rest, and a three-way interaction indicated a smaller reduction during meditation between sessions in the mindfulness group. There was a similar interaction in beta, which remained stable between sessions during both rest and meditation in the mindfulness group while varying in the classical music listening group. No significant effects were observed in global delta or gamma amplitudes. These findings suggest that changes in neural oscillations associated with breath-focused mindfulness meditation may be related to processes underlying attention and awareness. Further research is necessary to consolidate these findings, particularly in relation to the associated health benefits.
