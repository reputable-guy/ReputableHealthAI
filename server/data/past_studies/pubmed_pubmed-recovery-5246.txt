Study Title: Comparison of hypotension between propofol and remimazolam-propofol combinations sedation for day-surgery hysteroscopy: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Study Summary:
A combination of remimazolam and propofol could produce more stable sedation. A good medication regimen should consider not only efficacy but also safety, especially hypotension. The aim of the current study was to compare the incidence and amount of hypotension by propofol versus remimazolam-propofol combinations in day-surgery hysteroscopy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either propofol (Group P, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;125) or remimazolam-propofol combinations (Group RP, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;125) at a 1:1 ratio. Intravenous injection of sufentanil 0.1ug/kg were administered before sedative medication. In group P, a bolus of 2.5&#xa0;mg/kg propofol was administered. In group RP, intravenous anesthesia was commenced with 0.125&#xa0;mg/kg remimazolam and 1&#xa0;mg/kg propofol. After loss of consciousness, propofol was maintained at 6&#xa0;mg/kg/h. The primary outcomes were the incidence and amount of hypotension during surgery. Hypotension was defined as a MAP less than 65mmHg for at least 1&#xa0;min. The amount of hypotension was assessed by time-weighted average intraoperative MAP under a threshold of 65 mmHg. The secondary outcomes were various anesthesia related parameters and some adverse events. In group P, 25 patients (20.0%) experienced hypotension during hysteroscopy compared with 9 patients (7.2%) in group RP, for a difference of 12.8% (RR 2.778, 95%CI [1.352-5.709]). The combination of remimazolam and propofol resulted in significantly lower TWA (Time Weighted Average) threshold 0.14 (0.10-0.56) mmHg in group RP compared to 0.31 (0.15-0.67) mmHg in group P. The total dose of propofol was nearly double in group P compared to group RP. A significantly higher frequency of injection pain and low oxygen saturation was observed in the group P than that of the group RP. Hiccup was observed only in group RP. The incidences of body movement, bradycardia and vomiting were no significant difference between groups. The incidence and amount of hypotension by remimazolam-propofol combinations was significantly less than that by propofol sedation in day-surgery hysteroscopy. The optimization of medication regimen would attenuate the harm of hypotension and contribute to patients' rapid recovery in day surgery.
