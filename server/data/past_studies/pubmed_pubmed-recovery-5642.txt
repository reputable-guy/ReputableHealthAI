Study Title: Efficacy of predictive pain intervention in patients with aortic dissection.

Study Summary:
Aortic dissection is usually managed with interventional therapy, conservative therapy, and surgery to inhibit disease progression and improve prognoses. Nevertheless, the absence of meticulous and effective nursing during the treatment greatly increases the complication rates, which is detrimental to the recovery of patients. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of predictive pain intervention in the nursing process of patients with aortic dissection. Sixty patients with aortic dissection who were admitted to our hospital from December 2018 to December 2020 were observed in this study. Specifically, these patients were randomly and equally classified into Group A (patients who were given conventional nursing intervention) and Group B (patients who were given predictive pain intervention). Subsequently, the pain score, complication rates, and nursing satisfaction in the two groups were compared and analyzed. Compared with patients in Group A, patients in Group B had significantly lower pain scores (P< 0.05); complication rates were significantly lower in Group B than in Group A (6.67% vs. 23.33%, P< 0.05); patient satisfaction with care was significantly better in Group B compared to Group A (96.67% vs. 73.33%, P< 0.05). Predictive pain intervention is widely recognized as useful in the treatment of patients with aortic dissection. It has significant clinical application value as it can largely alleviate pain and is relatively safe for patients.
