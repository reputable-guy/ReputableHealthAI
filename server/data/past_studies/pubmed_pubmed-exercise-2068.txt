Study Title: High-intensity interval training with blood-flow restriction enhances sprint and maximal aerobic power in male endurance athletes.

Study Summary:
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can improve endurance performance. We investigated the concurrent impact of HIIT and blood-flow restriction (BFR) as a novel approach to further enhance maximal aerobic and anaerobic physiology and performances in trained athletes. In a randomized controlled trial, eighteen endurance-trained males (O65.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;mL.min.kg) included three sessions of HIIT per week (sets of 15 s efforts at 100% maximal aerobic power, interspersed by 15 s recovery) into their usual training for 3 weeks, either with restriction imposed on both lower limbs at 50%-70% of arterial occlusion pressure (BFR group,&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) or without (CTL group,&#xa0;=&#xa0;8), and were tested for sprint and endurance exercise performance. The total mechanical work developed during a 30 s Wingate test increased only in BFR (3.6%,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02). During the Wingate, changes in near-infrared spectroscopy-derived vastus lateralis muscle oxygenation (&#x394;(deoxy[Hb&#xa0;+&#xa0;Mb]), % arterial occlusion) were attenuated after BFR training (-8.8%,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04). The maximal aerobic power measured during an incremental cycling test increased only in BFR (4.5%,=&#xa0;0.0004), but there was no change inOamong groups. Both groups improved 5 km cycling time trial performance, but BFR displayed a concomitant greater elevation in [H] (11%,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02). Changes in other blood variables (e.g., pH, lactate, bicarbonate and potassium ion concentration, and hemoglobin) were not different between groups. Combining short-duration HIIT performed at 100% aerobic power with BFR elicited greater changes in sprint performance and maximal aerobic power in endurance athletes, associated with locomotor muscle metabolic adaptations but no meaningful effect on cardiorespiratory fitness.
