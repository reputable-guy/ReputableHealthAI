Study Title: Feasibility of a Yoga Intervention for Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Yoga is a potentially low risk intervention for cognitive impairment that combines mental and physical practice and includes instruction on breathing, stress reduction, and mindfulness meditation. Previous research documents that yoga can target modifiable risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression. The authors describe a randomized feasibility trial of yoga for individuals with MCI.Participants were 37 individuals with amnestic MCI who were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of twice-weekly yoga intervention (YI) or healthy living education (HLE) classes. Acceptability and feasibility were assessed by tracking adverse events, class attendance, and participant satisfaction. Participants completed neuropsychological and mood measures as well as measures of potential intervention mechanisms at baseline and immediately postintervention.Participants in both conditions reported high levels of satisfaction and reasonable class attendance rates. Home practice rates were low. There were no adverse events deemed related to the YI. Results showed a medium effect size in favor of the YI in visuospatial skills. The yoga group also showed a large effect size indicating decline in perceived stress compared with the HLE group, whereas HLE resulted in greater reductions in depressive symptoms after the intervention (large effect size).Study findings indicated that the YI was safe, modestly feasible, and acceptable to older adults with MCI. The authors found preliminary evidence that yoga may improve visuospatial functioning in individuals with MCI. Results support stress reduction as a possible mechanism for the YI. Future studies should address a YI in a larger sample and include strategies to enhance engagement and home practice.
