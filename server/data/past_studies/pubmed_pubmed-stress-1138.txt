Study Title: Implementing Resourcefulness Trainingwith Parent Caregivers of Children Dependent on Medical Technology During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned from a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Parent caregivers of children requiring life-saving medical technology (e.g., mechanical ventilation) report higher levels of stress and poorer health than other caregivers, often neglecting health-promoting behaviors for themselves. This article describes an iterative implementation science strategy used to improve intervention delivery for a randomized controlled trial testing a telehealth, cognitive-behavioral resourcefulness intervention with this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This process consisted of reflective team meetings and content analysis. Initial adjustments were made after content analysis of pilot study materials before intervention delivery including an intervention script, checklist, online daily log, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant texting option, training material access, and fidelity checks. In vivo adjustments were implemented in four areas: recruitment/engagement, participation and use of resources, in-person delivery, and virtual delivery. Our efforts to streamline intervention delivery were enhanced by incorporating an iterative implementation science strategy including analysis and adjustment of intervention delivery procedures to decrease participant burden and promote intervention adherence. Reflective team meetings and a collaborative, problem-solving approach to resolve the various barriers and challenges with the randomized controlled trial were integral components of intervention delivery. This study informs future intervention research by providing details of barriers faced, pragmatic adjustments made to intervention implementation, and lessons learned (NCT0410524; www.clinicaltrials.gov).
