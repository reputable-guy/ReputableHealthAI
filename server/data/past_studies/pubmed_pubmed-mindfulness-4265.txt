Study Title: Eight-month intensive meditation-based intervention improves refractory hallucinations and delusions and quality of life in male inpatients with schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the impact of an 8-month daily-guided intensive meditation-based intervention (iMI) on persistent hallucinations/delusions and health-related quality of life (QoL) in male inpatients with schizophrenia with treatment-refractory hallucinations and delusions (TRHDs). A randomized controlled trial assigned 64 male inpatients with schizophrenia and TRHD equally to an 8-month iMI plus general rehabilitation program (GRP) or GRP alone. Assessments were conducted at baseline and the third and eighth months using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), 36-Item Short Form-36 (SF-36), and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Primary outcomes measured PANSS reduction rates for total score, positive symptoms, and hallucinations/delusions items. Secondary outcomes assessed PANSS, SF-36, and FFMQ scores for psychotic symptoms, health-related QoL, and mindfulness skills, respectively. In the primary outcome, iMI significantly improved the reduction rates of PANSS total score, positive symptoms, and hallucination/delusion items compared with GRP at both the third and eighth months. Treatment response rates (&#x2265;25% reduction) for these measures significantly increased in the iMI group at the eighth month. Concerning secondary outcomes, iMI significantly reduced PANSS total score and hallucination/delusion items, while increasing scores in physical activity and mindfulness skills at both the third and eighth months compared with GRP. These effects were more pronounced with an 8-month intervention compared with a 3-month intervention. An iMI benefits patients with TRHDs by reducing persistent hallucinations/delusions and enhancing health-related QoL. Longer iMI duration yields superior treatment outcomes.
