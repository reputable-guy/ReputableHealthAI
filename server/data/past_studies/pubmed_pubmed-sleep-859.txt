Study Title: Nocturnal Melatonin Ingestion Improves Soccer Players' Short-Term Maximal Performances on the Following Day.

Study Summary:
Exogenous melatonin has been proven to have beneficial effects on sleep. A good sleep quality promotes recovery and improves physical performance. In this sense, the present study aimed to explore the potential effect of nocturnal melatonin ingestion on psycho-cognitive and short-term maximal performances, in the following morning.Twelve professional soccer players (22.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;years, 1.80&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05&#x2009;m, and 72.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.8&#x2009;kg) volunteered to perform two separate testing sessions after either nocturnal melatonin or placebo ingestion. The next morning, participants performed the following psycho-cognitive and physical tests: Hooper's index, reaction time, vigilance, handgrip strength (HG), squat jump (SJ), modified agility T-test (MAT) and Wingate anaerobic test (WanT). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood lactate [La] were recorded, respectively, immediately and 3&#x2009;min after the WanT. Blood glucose [GL] was measured before and 3&#x2009;min after WanT.Compared with placebo, melatonin improved subjective sleep quality, short-term maximal performances (HG and SJ), reaction-time, as well as peak and mean WanT powers and decreased fatigue index and RPE scores. However, [La] and [GL] were not affected by melatonin ingestion.Nocturnal melatonin intake before sleep has beneficial effects on cognitive and physical performances the following day.
