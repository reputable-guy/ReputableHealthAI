Study Title: Comparative Outcomes of a Cognitive-Behavioral Skills Building Program on the Mental Health and Healthy Behaviors of Prenursing Students.

Study Summary:
Nursing students experience significantly more stress related diseases when compared to non-nursing students, and the state of their mental health can result in short-term increased attrition rates and increased nursing shortages. A preexperimental pre-post study design was used to examine mental health and healthy behaviors among prenursing students. Cohorts received the MINDSTRONG&#xa9; program either in-person or virtually. Data analysis included Personal Wellness Assessments completed at both pre- and poststudy for all participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;110). Both groups postintervention had statistically significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and stress and statistically significant increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors and beliefs. Students with elevated depression and anxiety scores at baseline had greater decreases postintervention than the overall groups. The outcomes for both cohorts were positive and effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Healthy behaviors were improved and align with findings with an in-person format. Findings from this study support implementation of MINDSTRONG in synchronous sessions, either in-person or virtual.
