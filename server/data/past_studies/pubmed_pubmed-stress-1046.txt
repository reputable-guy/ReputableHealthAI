Study Title: Improving Self-Efficacy, Quality of Life, and Glycemic Control in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes: Randomized Controlled Trial for the Evaluation of the Family-Centered Empowerment Model.

Study Summary:
Poor glycemic management in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) increases complications. Enhanced control is associated with other factors, such as cultural, socioeconomic, and health care system disparities specific to the Middle East, which can greatly influence individuals' ability to get and use health care services as well as their reaction to treatment approaches. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the family-centered empowerment model on Jordanian adolescents with T1DM, focusing on their glycosylated hemoglobin levels, self-efficacy, and quality of life (QOL). A randomized controlled trial involved 68 adolescents with T1DM visiting Jordanian Royal Medical Services' clinics. Two sets of participant groups were created: control (n=34) and intervention (n=34). Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, receiving the family-centered empowerment model intervention, or the control group, receiving standard care. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical records. From April to October 2023, a total of 68 adolescents with T1DM participated in the study at the Jordanian Royal Medical Services. QOL had significant improvement among 13 (38%) of the 34 participants in the intervention group, and the program significantly improved moderate self-efficacy levels in 12 (35%) patients (P<.001). In addition, the average glycosylated hemoglobin levels dropped from 11.25% to 10.23% (P<.001). Additionally, improvements were seen in stress management, communication, and treatment adherence, with a substantial decrease in treatment obstacles. The intervention was successful in improving both clinical and psychosocial outcomes, as evidenced by the fact that the control group showed no noticeable improvements in these parameters. The study suggests that patients with T1DM should receive continuous care education sessions, including self-care training, to improve their health. Nurses should also incorporate this training into treatment plans and educational programs for adolescents to enhance their QOL.
