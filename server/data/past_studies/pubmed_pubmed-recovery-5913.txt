Study Title: Pudendal Block at the Time of Transvaginal Prolapse Repair: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The utility of pudendal nerve blocks (PNBs) at the time of transvaginal surgery is mixed in the literature. No published study has evaluated the efficacy of PNB since the widespread adoption of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways. This study aimed to determine if PNB, in addition to ERAS measures, at the time of vaginal reconstructive surgery reduces opioid use in the immediate postoperative period. In this randomized, blinded, controlled trial, women scheduled for transvaginal multicompartment prolapse repair were randomized to bilateral PNB before incision with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine versus usual care. Primary outcome was opioid use in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for the first 24 hours. The study was powered to detect a 5.57-MME difference in opioid use in the first 24 hours between groups. Forty-four patients were randomized from January 2020 to April 2022. The PNB and control groups were well matched in demographic and surgical data. There was no difference in opioid use in first 24 hours between the control and PNB groups (8 [0-20] vs 6.7 [0-15]; P = 0.8). Median pain scores at 24 and 48 hours did not differ between groups (4 &#xb1; 2 vs 3 &#xb1; 3; P = 0.44) and 90% of participants were satisfied with pain control across both groups. Time to return to normal activities (median, 10 days) was also not different between the groups. Because pain satisfaction after transvaginal surgery in the era of ERAS is high, with overall low opioid requirements, PNB provides no additional benefit.
