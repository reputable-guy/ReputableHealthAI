Study Title: Recent advances in the application of Mendelian randomization to chronic kidney disease.

Study Summary:
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and has been a focus of extensive research. Utilizing Mendelian randomization, researchers have begun to untangle the complex causal relationships underlying CKD. This review delves into the advances and challenges in the application of MR in the field of nephrology, shifting from a mere summary of its principles and limitations to a more nuanced exploration of its contributions to our understanding of CKD. Key findings from recent studies have been pivotal in reshaping our comprehension of CKD. Notably, evidence indicates that elevated testosterone levels may impair renal function, while higher sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels appear to be protective, predominantly in men. Surprisingly, variations in plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels seem unaffected by genetically induced changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), suggesting an independent pathway for renal function impairment. Furthermore, lifestyle factors such as physical activity and socioeconomic status emerge as significant influencers of CKD risk and kidney health. The relationship between sleep duration and CKD is nuanced; short sleep duration is linked to increased risk, while long sleep duration does not exhibit a clear causal effect. Additionally, lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, and mental wellness activities, play a crucial role in kidney health. New insights also reveal a substantial causal connection between both central and general obesity and CKD onset, while no significant links were found between genetically modified LDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels and kidney function. This review not only presents the recent achievements of MR in CKD research but also illuminates the path forwards, underscoring critical unanswered questions and proposing future research directions in this dynamic field.
