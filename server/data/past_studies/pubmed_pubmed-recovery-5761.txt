Study Title: Effectiveness of Shoulder Taping in Treating Hemiplegic Shoulder Subluxation: A Randomized Controlled Study of 35 Patients.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND Shoulder subluxation in patients with stroke impairs recovery and quality of life. Kinesiology tape is elastic and water-resistant, is commonly used to prevent musculoskeletal injury, and is increasing in use for rehabilitation of patients requiring neurological or physical rehabilitation. This study included 35 patients with shoulder subluxation following stroke and aimed to compare outcomes from standard physical therapy with and without shoulder kinesiology taping. MATERIAL AND METHODS This randomized controlled study involved 35 participants. The patients were randomized into a shoulder kinesiology taping group (n=18) or sham taping group (n=17). All patients underwent a conventional rehabilitation exercise program 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Half of the patients underwent shoulder kinesiology taping, and the other half underwent sham taping. Pre- and post-assessment scores were recorded for all participants for shoulder subluxation distance (SSD), active range of motion (AROM), visual analog scale (VAS), shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), and modified Barthel index (MBI). RESULTS After the intervention, SSD, AROM, VAS, SPADI, and MBI improved significantly in the shoulder kinesiology taping and sham taping groups (P<0.05). Also, the shoulder kinesiology taping group showed more effective changes in SSD, AROM, VAS, SPADI, and MBI than the sham taping group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the shoulder kinesiology taping is effective in improving SSD, AROM, VAS, SPADI, and MBI in patients with hemiplegic shoulder subluxation.
