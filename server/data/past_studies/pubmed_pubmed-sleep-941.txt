Study Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Clinical Hypnosis as an Opioid-Sparing Adjunct Treatment for Pain Relief in Adults Undergoing Major Oncologic Surgery.

Study Summary:
Clinical hypnosis is an effective strategy for managing acute pain in the surgical setting. However, the opioid sparing effects of clinical hypnosis are not as well understood. This pre-registered (NCT03730350) randomized, controlled trial (RCT) examined the impact of clinical hypnosis, pre- and post-surgery, on opioid consumption during hospitalization as well as on measures of pain intensity, pain interference, depressed mood, anxiety, sleep, and pain catastrophizing. Participants (M = 57.6 years; SD = 10.9) awaiting oncologic surgery were randomized to treatment-as-usual (n = 47) or hypnosis (n = 45). Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted using linear mixed effects modeling. A significant Group &#xd7; Time interaction,(6, 323.34) = 3.32,= 0.003, indicated an opioid sparing effect of clinical hypnosis during the acute postoperative period. Hypnosis also protected against increases in pain catastrophizing at one-week after surgery,(1, 75.26) = 4.04,= 0.048. A perioperative clinical hypnosis intervention had a sparing effect on opioid consumption in-hospital after major oncologic surgery. These findings extend the efficacy of clinical hypnosis as an adjunct tool for perioperative pain management.
