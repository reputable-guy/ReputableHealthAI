Study Title: Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.

Study Summary:
Around 40%-70% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) may experience cognitive impairments during the course of their disease with detrimental effects on social and occupational activities. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS has been investigated in pain, fatigue, and mood disorders related to MS, but to date, few studies have examined effects of tDCS on cognitive performance in MS. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of a multi-session tDCS protocol on cognitive performance and resting-state brain electrical activities in patients with MS. Twenty-four eligible MS patients were randomly assigned to real (anodal) or sham tDCS groups. Before and after 8 consecutive daily tDCS sessions over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), patients' cognitive performance was assessed using the Cambridge Brain Sciences-Cognitive Platform (CBS-CP). Cortical electrical activity was also evaluated using quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) analysis at baseline and after the intervention. Compared to the sham condition, significant improvement in reasoning and executive functions of the patients in the real tDCS group was observed. Attention was also improved considerably but not statistically significantly following real tDCS. However, no significant changes in resting-state brain activities were observed after stimulation in either group. Anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC appears to be a promising therapeutic option for cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings and to investigate underlying neuronal mechanisms.
