Study Title: Spearmint Extract Improves Working Memory in Men and Women with Age-Associated Memory Impairment.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementation with a spearmint (Mentha spicata L.) extract, high in polyphenols including rosmarinic acid, on cognitive performance, sleep, and mood in individuals with age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). Subjects with AAMI (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;90; 67% female; age&#x2009;=&#x2009;59.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6 years) were randomly assigned (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30/group) to consume 900, 600, or 0&#x2009;mg/day (two capsules, once daily) spearmint extract for 90 days, in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Assessments were completed for cognition (days 0, 45, and 90), sleep (days 0 and 90), and mood (days 0 and 90) by using the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) System, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), and Profile of Mood States (POMS), respectively. Quality of working memory and spatial working memory accuracy improved after supplementation with 900&#x2009;mg/day spearmint extract by 15% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0469) and 9% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0456), respectively, versus placebo. Subjects consuming 900&#x2009;mg/day spearmint extract reported improvement in their ability to fall asleep, relative to subjects consuming placebo (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0046). Overall treatment effects were evident for vigor-activity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0399), total mood disturbance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0374), and alertness and behavior following wakefulness (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0415), with trends observed for improvements after spearmint supplementation relative to placebo. These results suggest that the distinct spearmint extract may be a beneficial nutritional intervention for cognitive health in older subjects with AAMI.
