Study Title: No Effects of Carbohydrate Ingestion on Muscle Metabolism or Performance During Short-Duration High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise.

Study Summary:
Carbohydrates are critical for high-intensity exercise performance. However, the effects of carbohydrate supplementation on muscle metabolism and performance during short-duration high-intensity intermittent exercise remain inadequately explored. Our aim was to address this aspect in a randomized, counterbalanced, double-blinded crossover design. Eleven moderately-to-well-trained males performed high-intensity intermittent cycling receiving carbohydrate (CHO, ~55&#x2009;g/h) or placebo (PLA) fluid supplementation. Three exercise periods (EX1-EX3) were completed comprising 10&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;45&#x2009;s at ~105%&#x2009;Winterspersed with 135&#x2009;s rest between bouts and ~20&#x2009;min between periods. Repeated sprint ability (5&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;6&#x2009;s sprints with 24&#x2009;s recovery) was assessed at baseline and after each period. Thigh muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and before and after EX3 to determine whole-muscle and fiber-type-specific glycogen depletion. No differences were found in muscle glycogen degradation at the whole-muscle (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.683) or fiber-type-specific level (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.763-0.854) with similar post-exercise whole-muscle glycogen concentrations (146&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;20 and 122&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15&#x2009;mmol&#xb7;kgdw in CHO and PLA, respectively). Repeated sprint ability declined by ~9% after EX3 with no between-condition differences (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.971) and no overall differences in ratings of perceived exertion (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.550). This was despite distinctions in blood glucose concentrations throughout exercise, reaching post-exercise levels of 5.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.2 and 4.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.2&#x2009;mmol&#xb7;L(p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) in CHO and PLA, respectively, accompanied by fivefold higher plasma insulin levels in CHO (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). In conclusion, we observed no effects of carbohydrate ingestion on net muscle glycogen breakdown or sprint performance during short-duration high-intensity intermittent exercise despite elevated blood glucose and insulin levels. These results therefore question the efficacy of carbohydrate supplementation strategies in high-intensity intermittent sports.
