Study Title: Acute exercise boosts NADmetabolism of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Study Summary:
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) coenzymes are the central electron carriers in biological energy metabolism. Low NADlevels are proposed as a hallmark of ageing and several diseases, which has given rise to therapeutic strategies that aim to tackle these conditions by boosting NADlevels. As a lifestyle factor with preventive and therapeutic effects, exercise increases NADlevels across various tissues, but so far human trials are mostly focused on skeletal muscle. Given that immune cells are mobilized and redistributed in response to acute exercise, we conducted two complementary trials to test the hypothesis that a single exercise session alters NADmetabolism of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In a randomized crossover trial (DRKS00017686) with 24 young adults (12 female) we show that acute exercise increases gene expression and protein abundance of several key NADmetabolism enzymes with high conformity between high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). In a longitudinal exercise trial (DRKS00029105) with 12 young adults (6 female) we confirm these results and reveal that - similar to skeletal muscle - NADsalvage is pivotal for PBMCs in response to exercise. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of NADsalvage pathway, displayed a pronounced increase in gene expression during exercise, which was accompanied by elevated intracellular NADlevels and reduced serum levels of the NADprecursor nicotinamide. These results demonstrate that acute exercise triggers NADbiosynthesis of human PBMCs with potential implications for immunometabolism, immune effector function, and immunological exercise adaptions.
