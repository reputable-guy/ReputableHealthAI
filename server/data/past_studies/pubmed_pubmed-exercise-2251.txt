Study Title: Effect of perioperative rehabilitation exercise on postoperative outcomes in patients aged &#x2265;65&#xa0;years undergoing gastrointestinal surgery: A multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to assess the effect of perioperative rehabilitation exercise, initiated shortly after hospital admission, on postoperative outcomes in elderly patients. A prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, and assessor-blinded clinical trial. Hospital wards. Elderly patients (&#x2265;65&#xa0;years, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;160) scheduled for gastrointestinal surgery between June 2021 and November 2022 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Patients were divided into two groups base on whether they had received a specific type of exercise program initiated after hospital admission and continued until 30&#xa0;days after surgery. The primary outcome was the Comprehensive Complications Index (CCI) measured at 30&#xa0;days after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the rate of complications, number of complications, patient satisfaction, hospital readmission, postoperative length of stay, gastrointestinal function recovery, postoperative quality of life and psychological status. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. ITT analysis showed a significantly lower 30-day CCI in the intervention group (&#x3b2;: -6.31; 95&#xa0;% Confidence Interval [CI], -11.26 to -1.37, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013). Compared to controls, the intervention group had a decreased rate of hospital readmission (Odds Ratio: 0.00; 95&#xa0;% CI, 0.00 to 0.32, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022), less number of complications (&#x3b2;: -0.57; 95&#xa0;% CI, -1.03 to -0.11, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.016), as well as lower rate of postoperative anxiety (&#x3b2;: -0.74; 95&#xa0;% CI, -1.42 to -0.06, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.033) and depression scores (&#x3b2;: -1.13; 95&#xa0;% CI, -0.97 to -1.30, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008). Additionally, the intervention group reported higher satisfaction (&#x3b2;: 0.98; 95&#xa0;% CI, 0.33 to 1.64, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004) and Euro quality of life-Visual Analogue Scale scores (&#x3b2;: 8.88; 95&#xa0;% CI, 2.48 to 15.28, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007). Similar results were found in the PP analysis. Perioperative rehabilitation exercise has a positive impact on postoperative complications, quality of life and psychological well-being in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, even when implemented after hospital admission.
