Study Title: Effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises on symptoms of premenstrual syndrome: A single-blind random&#x131;zed controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study was carried out to determine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises (PMR) on premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. The study was designed in a single-blind randomized controlled type. The study was conducted in a hospital in Western T&#xfc;rkiye. Seventy-nine single women who experienced PMS who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the experimental group in which PMR would be applied, and the control group to continue their routine coping habits regarding PMS. PMR were applied to the experimental group every day for 8&#xa0;weeks. At the end of 8&#xa0;weeks, the experimental and control groups were re-evaluated with the Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS). At the beginning of the study, it was observed that the individual, health characteristics and PMSS mean scores of the women in the experimental and control groups were similar (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). At the end of eight weeks, it was seen that the mean PMSS score of the experimental group was lower than that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). When in-group comparisons were made at the end of the exercise program, no significant difference was found in the mean PMSS score of the control group compared to the beginning (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). The PMSS score of the experimental group decreased significantly and the difference was statistically significant (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). In this study, it was seen that PMR were effective in improving PMS.
