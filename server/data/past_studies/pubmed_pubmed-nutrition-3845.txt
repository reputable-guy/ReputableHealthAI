Study Title: Reducing BMI below the obesity threshold in adolescents treated with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to examine how improvement in BMI with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide translated to changes in BMI category in a post hoc analysis of the double-blind, phase 3a randomized controlled Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) TEENS trial. Adolescents with obesity received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo plus lifestyle intervention, which comprised counseling in healthy nutrition and a goal of 60 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity per day. Achievement of an improvement in BMI category and attainment of normal-weight or overweight BMI by week 68 were analyzed using logistic regression models. In the overall population, 44.9% of participants receiving semaglutide achieved weight reduction resulting in reclassification to a normal-weight or overweight BMI category versus 12.1% receiving placebo at week 68 (odds ratio: 22.7; 95% CI: 7.6-67.9). The proportion of semaglutide-treated participants in obesity class III decreased from 37.3% to 13.6% but increased with placebo. The odds ratio for achieving an improvement of at least one BMI category was significantly greater with semaglutide versus placebo (23.5; 95% CI: 9.9-55.5); an improvement of at least one BMI category was seen in 73.7% of participants receiving semaglutide compared with 19.0% of participants receiving placebo. Semaglutide was highly effective in reducing BMI category. While on treatment, most trial participants' BMI improved by at least one category, and >40% reached a category below the obesity threshold.
