Study Title: Test-reduced teaching for stimulation of intrinsic motivation (TRUST): a randomized controlled intervention study.

Study Summary:
The anatomy dissection course is a major part of the first two years of the traditional medical curriculum in Germany. The vast amount of content to be learned and the repeated examination is unanimously perceived by students and teachers as a major stress factor that contributes to the increase of psychosocial stress during the first two years of the course of study. Published interventions for specific stress reduction are scarce. In a randomized, controlled design two intervention groups were compared with a control group (CG) over the whole dissection course (nine measuring points before, during and after first and second semester). The 'Stress Management intervention (IVSM)' targeted at the setting of personal standards, the 'Friendly Feedback intervention (IVFF)' at the context of frequent testing. Quantitative surveys were distributed at nine measuring points. The questionnaire comprised validated instruments and self-developed items regarding stress, positive and negative affect, anxiety, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and perceived performance. Out of 195 students inscribed in the dissection course, 166 (85%) agreed to participate in the study. The experience of stress during the dissection course was significantly higher in the CG than in the IVFF. Anxiety and negative affect were lower in students of the IVFF while positive affect, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy were higher than in the CG. For anxiety and negative affect in the IVSM this was especially seen at the end of the second semester. The self-perceived increase in both knowledge and preparedness for the first big oral and written examination did not differ between the study groups. About three quarters of the participants would choose the intervention 'Friendly Feedback' if given the choice. Replacing formal tests with friendly feedback has proven to be an effective measure to reduce stress and negative affect and foster positive affect, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation, while it did not impair self-perceived academic performance.
