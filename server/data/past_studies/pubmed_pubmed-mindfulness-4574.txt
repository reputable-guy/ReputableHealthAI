Study Title: Mindfulness-based stress reduction for men on active surveillance for prostate cancer and their spouses: Design and methodology of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Although active surveillance (AS) is an increasingly adopted treatment paradigm for management of very low risk prostate cancer, many men and their partners face a variety of AS-related psychosocial stressors. Stressors may include anxiety and fear of progression, which may negatively affect short- and long-term psychosocial adjustment and influence early withdrawal from AS in order to seek definitive therapies such as surgery or radiation. Here we describe the protocol for an NCI-funded trial, which seeks to examine the efficacy of mindfulness training compared with a time/attention-matched health promotion control condition in a geographically generalizable sample of men on AS and their spouses. Using a randomized, controlled, partially double-blinded study design, this study involves the delivery of 8&#xa0;weeks of standardized mindfulness training (MBSR; mindfulness-based stress reduction) and patient reported outcomes over a 12-month period (proposed enrollment of 80 men on AS and spouses), compared with a health promotion control (proposed enrollment of 80 men on AS and spouses) that has been matched for time and attention. Baseline (T1) measures (e.g., anxiety, fear of progression, quality of life) are administered just prior to randomization to the two study arms, followed by repeated assessments at 2&#xa0;months (T2), 6&#xa0;months (T3) and 12&#xa0;months (T4). This study has the potential to offer men and their partners on AS with important educational and self-regulatory skills to better cope and adjust with known stressors related to being placed on this protocol.
