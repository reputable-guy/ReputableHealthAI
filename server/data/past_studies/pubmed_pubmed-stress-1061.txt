Study Title: Life skills programmes for university-based wellness support services for students in health sciences professions: a scoping review.

Study Summary:
Student wellness is a major concern during the educational programme of health professionals, as mental distress impacts negatively on students' academic performance and success. Available literature indicates that improving student wellness has the potential to increase academic performance and success for students. Medical schools implement various forms of support to lessen student distress and enhance wellness. Mental health challenges amongst university students in health sciences professions continue to be on the rise despite support services offered by medical schools. A scoping review methodology was used and a detailed search of seven databases including MEDLINE, Ovid Emcare, Embase, Scopus, PsychINFO, and ERIC was performed. The steps of the Preferred Reporting Items extension&#xa0;for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and guidelines suggested by Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews were followed. Studies that described or investigated life skills programmes with students in health professions, including medicine and nursing fields, were included. Studies were excluded if they were not published in English and did not describe university-based support programmes with students in health sciences professions. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria 66 articles were included and explored in detail. The identified life skills were grouped into three categories, namely cognitive skills, emotional skills as well as interpersonal and social skills. Life skills are necessary to enhance lifelong learning for university students in health sciences professions. These skills encompass the development of a range of competencies including personal, intellectual, social, and emotional skills. Incorporating these life skills as part of holistic student wellness programmes may be an important consideration in guiding wellness support services implemented at universities.
