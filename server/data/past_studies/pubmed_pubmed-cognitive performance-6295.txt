Study Title: Effect of a 16-week multi-level classroom standing desk intervention on cognitive performance and academic achievement in adolescents.

Study Summary:
The replacement of traditional classroom desks for active-permissive desks has been tested to reduce sitting time during classes. However, their impact on other domains is still unclear. We aimed to verify the potential effects of a classroom standing desk intervention on cognitive function and academic achievement in 6th-grade students. This was a controlled trial conducted with two classes [intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) and control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27)] from a public school in Lisbon, Portugal. The intervention was carried out for 16&#xa0;weeks and consisted of multi-level actions (students, parents, and teachers) centered on the implementation of standing desks in the intervention classroom. The control group had traditional classes with no use of standing desks or any other interference/action from the research team. Pre- and post-assessments of executive functions (attention, inhibitory function, memory, and fluid intelligence) and academic achievement were obtained. No differences between groups were found at baseline. Both groups improved (time effect) academic achievement (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), memory span (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and inhibitory function (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). Group versus time interactions were observed regarding operational memory (intervention: +&#x2009;18.0% and control: +&#x2009;41.6%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039) and non-verbal fluid intelligence (intervention: -&#x2009;14.0% and control: +&#x2009;3.9%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017). We concluded that a 16-week classroom standing desk intervention did not improve cognitive performance or academic achievement more than the traditional sitting classes.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT03137836) (date of first registration: 03/05/2017).
