Study Title: Effectiveness of promethazine on preoperative and intraoperative sequelae in cleft palate surgeries.

Study Summary:
Anxiety and nosocomial infection are the most common reported problems in children undergoing cleft surgeries. Research shows that there is an enigma in the use of antihistamine therapy in children for the management of upper respiratory tract infection. 'Promethazine' is a first-generation H1 receptor antagonist, and antihistamine also has strong sedative effects. Our study aims at evaluating the Effectiveness of Promethazine (Phenergan) in preoperative and intra operative sequelae in cleft surgeries. This is a single-centre, parallel, randomized, double-blinded randomized control clinical trial, which was conducted among 128 children between 2 and 4&#x2009;years of age undergoing cleft palate surgery under general anaesthesia. After randomization, the case group was subjected to promethazine syrup 1&#x2009;mg/kg body weight twice a day, orally for 3&#x2009;days. The primary outcomes were preoperative anxiety levels which were recorded by children fear scale. The secondary outcomes include preoperative sleep quality and cough rate of children which are recorded by using sleep and cough objective scale respectively. The intraoperative heart rate is monitored with an ECG connected to a monitor. Promethazine causes a reduction in the anxiety level by 70%, 64% reduction in cold and cough, improvement in sleep score by 70% and the heart rate was found to be stable throughout the surgery when compared to the control group. As the benefits of promethazine in cleft palate surgery rule over its adverse effects, promethazine is considered safe to be used as premedication for children undergoing cleft palate surgeries.
