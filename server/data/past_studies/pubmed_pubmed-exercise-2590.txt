Study Title: Assessment of the Omius&#x2122; cooling headband effectiveness during a 70-min submaximal running effort followed by a 5-km time-trial in hot/humid conditions.

Study Summary:
Exercise performed under hot/humid conditions can hinder endurance performance. The Omius&#x2122; headband (OH) is purported to reduce the perception of heat and improve performance. We examined the impact of OH on selected thermal and cardiovascular functions, subjective perceptions and running performance. Using a randomized crossover protocol, 10 trained male athletes (28&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4 years) completed two trials (OH and sham headband (SH), 35.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.3&#xa0;&#xb0;C, 56&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3% relative humidity) comprising 70&#xa0;min of running (60% V&#x2d9;O) followed by a 5-km running time-trial (TT). Heart rate, perceived exertion and whole-body thermal comfort did not significantly differ between conditions during the submaximal running effort and TT. Rectal temperature was higher with OH (0.11&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.16&#xa0;&#xb0;C, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.052) than SH prior to the submaximal running effort, however, no significant differences were observed between conditions regarding the changes in rectal temperature from baseline during the submaximal running effort and TT. Forehead temperature was significantly lower with OH than SH during the submaximal running effort, but no significant differences were observed at the end of the TT. Scores of perceived forehead thermal comfort were only significantly lower with OH than SH during the submaximal running effort. TT performance did not significantly differ between OH (19.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;min) and SH (20.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.0&#xa0;min). In conclusion, OH improves forehead thermal comfort and reduces forehead temperature but not rectal temperature, heart rate and perceived exertion during, nor 5-km TT performance following, 70&#xa0;min of submaximal running in the heat.
