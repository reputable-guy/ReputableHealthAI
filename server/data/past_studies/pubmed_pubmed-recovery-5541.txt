Study Title: The effects of remimazolam combined with sufentanil on respiration, circulation and sedation level in patients undergoing colonoscopy.

Study Summary:
The main sedative which is propofol in painless gastroenteroscopy, has a high risk of reducing blood pressure and respiratory depression. Remimazolam (a short-acting benzodiazepine) is expected to be widely used in painless gastroenteroscopy due to its rapid onset, rapid metabolism and light respiratory and circulation inhibition. A randomized, single-blind, parallel, controlled study, 123 outpatients who were undergoing painless colonoscopy and ramdomly divided into group A, B and C, in Hangzhou First People's Hospital, July-December 2021. All patients were intravenously injected with 5&#xa0;&#xb5;g sufentanil for analgesic preconditioning. The group A was induced by 0.2&#xa0;mg/kg remimazolam besylate. The group B was induced by 0.25&#xa0;mg/kg remimazolam besylate. And the group C was inducted by 2.0&#xa0;mg /kg propofol. If the patients had limb movement or MOAA/S score&#x2009;>&#x2009;3 and so on, remimazolam besylate was added at 2.5&#xa0;mg/ time in group A and B, and propofol emulsion injection was added at 0.5&#xa0;mg/kg/ time in group C. During the operation, according to the actual situation, remimazolam was per added 2.5&#xa0;mg in the experimental group, and propofol was 0.5&#xa0;mg/kg in the control group. Heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO), and improved vigilance/sedation score (MOAA/S) of patients was recorded from entering endoscopy room to get out of the anesthesia recovery room, also including perioperative adverse events, other medications or treatments, the time of patients waking up and leaving the hospital. The successful rate of induction in three groups was 100%. There was no significant difference in the sedation completion rate among the three groups (Group A:90.2%, Group B: 92.7%, Group C: 92.7%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.000). The rate of adverse events after administration: group A(27.0%) and B(36.8%) both lower than group C(71.0%),P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001;There was no significant difference between group A and group B, P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.744;The average time from the last drug administration to meet the discharge criteria of the subjects in three groups was as follows: The average time of group A(16.2&#xa0;min) and Group B(16.5&#xa0;min) both shorter than group C(19.6&#xa0;min), P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001; There was no significant difference between group A and group B, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.742. This study revealed that remimazolam is a safe and effective medication for colonoscopy sedation, the security of remimazolam is better than propofol, and the sedative effect with the initial dose of 0.25&#xa0;mg/kg of remimazolam is optimal.
