Study Title: Dupilumab treatment improves signs, symptoms, quality of life, and work productivity in patients with atopic hand and foot dermatitis: Results from a phase&#xa0;3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Despite high disease burden, systemic treatment options for patients with atopic hand and/or foot dermatitis (H/F AD) are limited. To evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab in H/F AD using specific instruments for assessing disease severity on hands and feet. In this multicenter phase 3 trial, adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe H/F AD were randomized to dupilumab monotherapy (regimen approved for generalized AD), or matched placebo. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving Hand and Foot Investigator's Global Assessment score 0 or 1 at week 16. Secondary prespecified endpoints assessed the severity and extent of signs, symptom intensity (itch, pain), quality of life, and sleep. A total of 133 patients (adults&#xa0;=&#xa0;106, adolescents&#xa0;=&#xa0;27) were randomized to dupilumab (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;67) or placebo (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;66). At week 16, significantly more patients receiving dupilumab (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27) than placebo (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11) achieved Hand and Foot Investigator's Global Assessment score 0 or 1 (40.3% vs 16.7%; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.003). All other prespecified endpoints were met. Safety was consistent with the known AD dupilumab profile. Short-term, 16-week treatment period. Dupilumab monotherapy resulted in significant improvements across different domains of H/F AD with acceptable safety, supporting dupilumab as a systemic treatment approach for this often difficult to treat condition.
