Study Title: Impact of L-theanine and L-tyrosine on markers of stress and cognitive performance in response to a virtual reality based active shooter training drill.

Study Summary:
Ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine has been shown to reduce salivary stress biomarkers and improve aspects of cognitive performance in response to stress. However, there have been no studies to concurrently examine the impact of both L-theanine and L-tyrosine ingestion during a mental stress challenge (MSC) involving a brief cognitive challenge and a virtual reality based active shooter training drill. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine on markers of stress and cognitive performance in response to a virtual reality active shooter drill and cognitive challenge. The cognitive challenge involved a Stroop challenge and mental arithmetic. Eighty subjects (age = 21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.6 yrs; male = 46; female = 34) were randomly assigned L-tyrosine (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28; 2000&#x2009;mg), L-theanine (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25; 200&#x2009;mg), or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) prior to MSC exposure. Saliva samples, state-anxiety inventory (SAI) scales, and heart rate (HR) were collected before and after exposure to the MSC. Saliva was analyzed for stress markers &#x3b1;-amylase (sAA) and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). The MSC resulted in significant increases in sAA, SIgA, HR, and SAI. Ingestion of L-theanine and L-tyrosine did not impact markers of stress. However, the L-tyrosine treatment demonstrated significantly lower missed responses compared to the placebo treatment group during the Stroop challenge. These data demonstrate that ingestion of L-theanine or L-tyrosine does not impact markers of stress in response to a MSC but may impact cognitive performance. This study was pre-registered as a clinical trial ("Impact of supplements on stress markers": NCT05592561).
