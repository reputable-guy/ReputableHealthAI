Study Title: Is One Enough? The Effectiveness of a Single Session of Education and Exercise Compared to Multiple Sessions of a Multimodal Physiotherapy Intervention for Adults With Spinal Disorders in an Advanced Practice Physiotherapy Model of Care: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the effectiveness of a single session of education and exercise compared with multiple sessions of a multimodal physiotherapy intervention for adults with spinal disorders in an advanced practice physiotherapy specialized spine model of care.Pragmatic randomized controlled trial.We randomized patients with spinal disorders, who were referred for a spinal surgery consultation and triaged as nonsurgical cases by an advanced practice physiotherapist, to a single session of education and prescription of an exercise program (n = 52) or multiple sessions (6 in total) of a multimodal physiotherapy intervention (n = 54). The primary outcomes were the short form Brief Pain Inventory pain severity scale (BPI-S) and the Brief Pain Inventory pain interference scale (BPI-I), and secondary outcomes included disability, quality of life, catastrophization, and satisfaction. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences between groups across time points at 6, 12, and 26 weeks.There were no significant between-group differences on the BPI-S and only a significant improvement at 6 weeks on the BPI-I in the multiple-session group (mean difference: -0.96/10; 95% CI, -1.87 to -0.05). There were no other statistically significant differences between groups, except for satisfaction where participants in the multiple-session group reported statistically significantly greater satisfaction on the 9-item Visit-Specific Satisfaction Questionnaire and the MedRisk questionnaire. Both groups saw significant improvements over time on all outcomes except for the BPI-S.Adding supervised multimodal physiotherapy sessions did not result in better clinical outcomes when compared to a single session of education and exercise. Patients were more satisfied with the multiple-session approach..
