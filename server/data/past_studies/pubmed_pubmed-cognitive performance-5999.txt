Study Title: No transfer of 3D-Multiple Object Tracking training on game performance in soccer: A follow-up study.

Study Summary:
The impact of domain-general cognitive 'brain' training on improving sports performance is highly debated. This study sought to follow-up on research that showcased the benefits of perceptual-cognitive 3D-Multiple Object Tracking (3D-MOT) training in enhancing the on-field performance of soccer players. Additionally, it explored the correlation between athletes' cognitive performance and early career success. Sixty-two males from a professional soccer academy were randomly divided into a dual-task 3D-MOT training group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) and a control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32). Participants underwent a 3D-MOT test, a cognitive test of attention, and small-sided games at pre- and post-training. Pre-post-test performances were compared using ANCOVAs. A Chi-squared test evaluated the association between the training regimen and early career success. A Spearman test assessed the correlation between performance on the 3D-MOT, attention test, and early career success. The dual-task 3D-MOT trained group significantly improved its performance on 3D-MOT compared to the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). However, no significant pre-post-test differences were observed between the groups in the near-transfer cognitive test and on-field performance (ps&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). There were no associations between the athletes' early career success and the training regimen, and no associations between cognitive test performances and early career success (ps&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). This follow-up study failed to replicate previous findings with dual-task 3D-MOT training unable to produce near or far transfer on soccer performance. In addition, cognitive performance was not related to early career success in this study. The value of cognitive screening and training in sport is discussed.
