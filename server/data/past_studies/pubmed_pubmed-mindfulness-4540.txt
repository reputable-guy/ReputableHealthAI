Study Title: Mindfulness-based stress reduction for community-dwelling older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in primary care: a mixed-methods feasibility randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
Primary care is often the first point of contact when community-dwelling older adults experience subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Living with SCD or MCI can be life-altering, resulting in low mood and increased anxiety, further exacerbating cognitive decline. However, there is scant literature on interventions that interprofessional primary care providers can provide to support those living with SCD or MCI. Practicing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in an interprofessional primary care setting may support emotional health and well-being for those with cognitive decline, but it has not been studied in an interprofessional primary care context. This study's primary aim was to determine the feasibility of, and perceived benefits to and satisfaction with, a 9-Week MBSR program delivered in a team-based primary care setting. The secondary aim was to examine the acceptability of using technology (computer tablet and App Insight Timer&#xae;) for program delivery and home practice. A convergent mixed-methods, single-blind pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) study design was used. A quantitative strand was used to evaluate the feasibility of the MBSR program. The qualitative strand used a focus group with older adult participants with SCD or MCI. Individual semi-structured interviews with occupational therapists who are qualified-MBSR teachers were conducted to explore the acceptability of using computer tablets for program delivery and home practice. 27 participants were randomized (14 MBSR; 13 Control) with retention rates of 64.3% (9/14 completed &#x2265;6 sessions), true adherence rates of 50% (7/14 met &#x2265;19.5&#x2009;hrs of home practice), 21.4% attrition rates, and 100% post-intervention follow-up. No participants who used computer tablets at the beginning of the intervention switched to low technology. Older adult participants found the use of computer tablets in the MBSR course acceptable and appreciated the portability of the tablets. Based on the lower-than-expected rates of recruitment, retention, and adherence, our study, as designed, did not meet the feasibility benchmarks that were set. However, with minor modifications to the design, including changing how participants who drop-out are analyzed, extending recruitment, and adding multiple sites, this intervention would be well suited to further study using a full-scale RCT. However, we found that embedding MBSR in an interprofessional primary care setting was feasible in practice and qualitative data highlighted the satisfaction and perceived benefits based on the intervention. The use of technology was acceptable and portable, as participants utilized their computer tablets consistently until the study's end. Our study showed that older adults living with SCD or MCI were highly receptive to learning how to use technology, and future group intervention programs in interprofessional primary care settings may also incorporate tablet use. This study was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Board in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (REB# 2017-0056-E); Queen's University (REB# 6026418) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and Clinicaltrials.gov (08/03/2019; NCT03867474).
