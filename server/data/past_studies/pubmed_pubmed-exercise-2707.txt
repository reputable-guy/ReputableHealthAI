Study Title: Sweat lactate sensor for detecting anaerobic threshold in heart failure: a prospective clinical trial (LacS-001).

Study Summary:
A simple method for determining the anaerobic threshold in patients with heart failure (HF) is needed. This prospective clinical trial (LacS-001) aimed to investigate the safety of a sweat lactate-monitoring sensor and the correlation between lactate threshold in sweat (sLT) and ventilatory threshold (VT). To this end, we recruited 50 patients with HF and New York Heart Association functional classification I-II (mean age: 63.5&#xa0;years, interquartile range: 58.0-72.0). Incremental exercise tests were conducted while monitoring sweat lactate levels using our sensor. sLT was defined as the first steep increase in lactate levels from baseline. Primary outcome measures were a correlation coefficient of&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.6 between sLT and VT, similarities as assessed by the Bland-Altman analysis, and standard deviation of the difference within 15 W. A correlation coefficient of 0.651 (95% confidence interval, 0.391-0.815) was achieved in 32/50 cases. The difference between sLT and VT was -4.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15.0 W. No comparative error was noted in the Bland-Altman plot. No device-related adverse events were reported among the registered patients. Our sweat lactate sensor is safe and accurate for detecting VT in patients with HF in clinical settings, thereby offering valuable additional information for treatment.
