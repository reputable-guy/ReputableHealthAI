Study Title: A comparison between the effects of vibration exercise and needle therapy on fibromyalgia symptoms and well-being in community-dwelling older adults: A randomized control study.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled pilot study compared the efficiency of exercise on a vibration machine combined with needle therapy versus needle therapy alone in managing fibromyalgia symptoms and well-being among older adults. Conducted at King Khalid Hospital in Alkharj, Saudi Arabia, the study involved eighty-six patients aged 60 to 67 years. Participants were randomly assigned to either the VENT (Vibration Exercise Device) group or the NT (Needle Therapy) group. The VENT group underwent 10-minute vibration training sessions twice a week, paired with 30-minute needle acupuncture sessions once a week, while the NT group received needle therapy alone. Both interventions were carried out over 12 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured disability, pain, balance, and quality of life. Data analysis showed that 94.1% of participants completed the study, with significant improvements in disability observed in the VENT group. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in pain, balance, and well-being. However, post-intervention comparisons favored the VENT group, showing significantly better outcomes. The findings suggest that combining vibratory exercise with needle therapy offers enhanced benefits for older adults with fibromyalgia.
