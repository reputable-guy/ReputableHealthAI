Study Title: Effect of Teneligliptin 20&#x2009;mg Twice Daily on Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Levels and Its Influence on Non-Glycemic Components in Non-Diabetic Obese Individuals.

Study Summary:
Teneligliptin is an oral antidiabetic agent, it can persevere glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase enzyme. In addition, it has rare incidence of hypoglycemia. Hence, this study aimed to test the effect of teneligliptin 20&#x2009;mg twice daily along with low carbohydrate diet and physical exercise on change of body weight and insulin resistance in nondiabetic obese subjects.It is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study carried out at outpatient department of an endocrinology hospital over the period of 48 weeks. Teneligliptin 20&#x2009;mg twice daily 30&#x2009;min before food (low carbohydrate diet [LCD]) with regular physical exercise, and control group was kept with placebo twice daily 30&#x2009;min before food LCD with regular physical exercise. This study was registered in clinical trial registry of India [CTRI/2020/02/023329].A total of 150 nondiabetic obese subjects were randomized into test (&#x2009;=&#x2009;75) and control groups (&#x2009;=&#x2009;75). At the end of 48 weeks there was significant improvement in GLP-1, simplified nutrition assessment questionnaire (SNAQ) score, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG), and body weight. The mean difference and 95% confidence interval of GLP-1 (pg/mL) was 76.42 (44.42-148.41) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.37); SNAQ score, -1.64 (-2.48 to -0.81) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000); HOMA-IR, -0.9 (-0.59 to -0.38) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000); TG (mg/dL) -29.37 (-44.46 to -14.07) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000); reduction of body weight (kilograms) -3.09 (-6.11 to -0.07) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043).Findings of this study reveals that teneligliptin-treated group showed significant improvement in GLP-1 levels, reduced insulin resistance, body weight, TG, appetite, and metabolic syndrome. Teneligliptin is well tolerated, except in upper respiratory tract infections. CTR number: CTRI/2020/02/023329.
