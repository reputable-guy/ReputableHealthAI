Study Title: Comparison of high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training on cardiopulmonary function, cardiac autonomic function and vascular function in adolescent boys with obesity: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Adolescent obesity can impair cardiopulmonary function, vascular elasticity, endothelial function, and vago-sympathetic balance. While moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) benefits cardiovascular health in obese adolescents, the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are less understood. We hypothesize that HIIT may be more effective than MICT in improving VOpeak, vascular elasticity, endothelial function, and vago-sympathetic balance in obese adolescent boys. Forty four participants were randomly assigned to the HIIT (10&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;1-min at 85%-95% peak HR, intersperse with 2-min active recovery at 60%-70% peak HR) or MICT (35&#xa0;min at 65%-75% peak HR) for an 8-week program. The primary outcome measured was the change in VOwith secondary outcomes including brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and heart rate variability (HRV). Forty four adolescent boys with obesity (age, 14&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1&#xa0;years old, body mass index, 31.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;kg/m) were enrolled and 43 (97.73%) completed the 8-week exercise. No significant difference of VOwas found between the HIIT and MICT group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.243). There was no significant difference of baPWV between the groups (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.789). Change in FMD% was significantly higher in the HIIT group compared to the MICT group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). The Change in HRV-high frequency (HRV-HF; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009) and HRV-low frequency/high frequency (HRV-LF/HF; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.035) was significantly higher in the HIIT group compared to the MICT group. Among adolescent boys with obesity, 8-week HIIT and MICT had similar effects on improving VO. HIIT may be superior to MICT to improve endothelial function and vago-sympathetic balance.
