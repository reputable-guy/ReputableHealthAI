Study Title: Effects of Dietary Supplementation of a Microalgae Extract Containing Fucoxanthin Combined with Guarana on Cognitive Function and Gaming Performance.

Study Summary:
Esports competitive gaming requires selective visual attention, memory, quick judgment, and an ability to sustain psychomotor performance over time. Fucoxanthin is a carotenoid, found in specific microalgae varieties such as(), that has been purported to possess nootropic and neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study evaluated whether acute and 30-day supplementation of an extract offrom microalgae combined with guarana (a natural source of caffeine) affects cognitive function in gamers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner, 61 experienced gamers (21.7 &#xb1; 4.1 years, 73 &#xb1; 13 kg) were randomly assigned to ingest a placebo (PL), a low-dose (LD) supplement containing 440 mg ofextract including 1% fucoxanthin +500 mg of guarana containing 40-44 mg caffeine (MicroPhyt&#x2122;, Microphyt, Baillargues, FR), or a high-dose (HD) supplement containing 880 mg ofextract +500 mg of guarana for 30 days. At baseline, cognitive function tests were administered before supplementation, 15 min post-supplementation, and after 60 min of competitive gameplay with participants' most played video game. Participants continued supplementation for 30 days and then repeated pre-supplementation and post-gaming cognitive function tests. General linear model univariate analyses with repeated measures and changes from baseline with 95% confidence intervals were used to analyze data. There was some evidence that acute and 30-day ingestion of theextract from microalgae with guarana improved reaction times, reasoning, learning, executive control, attention shifting (cognitive flexibility), and impulsiveness. While some effects were seen after acute ingestion, the greatest impact appeared after 30 days of supplementation, with some benefits seen in the LD and HD groups. Moreover, there was evidence that both doses of theextract from microalgae with guarana may support mood state after acute and 30-day supplementation. Registered clinical trial #NCT04851899.
