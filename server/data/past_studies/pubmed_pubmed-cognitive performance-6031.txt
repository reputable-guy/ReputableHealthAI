Study Title: Effect of a four-week oral Phe administration on neural activation and cerebral blood flow in adults with early-treated phenylketonuria.

Study Summary:
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by impaired catabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. Cross-sectional studies suggest slight alterations in cognitive performance and neural activation in adults with early-treated PKU. The influence of high Phe levels on brain function in adulthood, however, remains insufficiently studied. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effect of a four-week period of oral Phe administration - simulating a controlled discontinuation of Phe restriction and raising Phe to an off-diet scenario - on working memory-related neural activation and cerebral blood flow (CBF). We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, non-inferiority trial to assess the effect of a high Phe load on working memory-related neural activation and CBF in early-treated adults with classical PKU. Twenty-seven patients with early-treated classical PKU were included and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the working memory network and arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to assess CBF before and after a four-week intervention with Phe and placebo. At each of the four study visits, fMRI working memory task performance (reaction time and accuracy) and plasma Phe, tyrosine, and tryptophan levels were obtained. Additionally, cerebral Phe was determined byH-MR spectroscopy. Plasma Phe and cerebral Phe were significantly increased after the Phe intervention. However, no significant effect of Phe compared to placebo was found on neural activation and CBF. Regarding fMRI task performance, a significant impact of the Phe intervention on 1-back reaction time was observed with slower reaction times following the Phe intervention, whereas 3-back reaction time and accuracy did not differ following the Phe intervention compared to the placebo intervention. Results from this present trial simulating a four-week discontinuation of the Phe-restricted diet showed that a high Phe load did not uniformly affect neural markers and cognition in a statistically significant manner. These results further contribute to the discussion on safe Phe levels during adulthood and suggest that a four-week discontinuation of Phe-restricted diet does not demonstrate significant changes in brain function.
