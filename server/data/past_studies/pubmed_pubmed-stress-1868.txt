Study Title: The potential of infra-low frequency neurofeedback training in peak performance: The first double-blinded placebo-controlled longitudinal study in healthy adults.

Study Summary:
Infra-low frequency neurofeedback training (ILF-NFT) has shown promise in addressing cognitive and affective distress symptoms across a range of psychiatric disorders. This study tested ILF-NFT's effects in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled longitudinal context in healthy psychology students. Across five weeks, forty-two healthy psychology students (aged 18-35) were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving ten sessions of 30&#xa0;minutes of active and sham ILF-NFT. Dependent variables were measured before, following, and two months after the intervention and were comprised of: heartrate variability assessments as a measure of stress resilience; digit span, n-back, trail making and go-no-go task measures of executive functioning performance; and SCL-90-R, WHOQOL-Bref, and peak performance measures of subjective self-report. Statistical analysis was performed using an ANCOVA and compared across groups correcting for baseline differences and multiple comparisons. ANCOVA analyses revealed no significant differences across active and placebo groups in any dependent variables, when correcting for multiple comparisons. Thus, the remaining analyses focused on questionnaire correlations. Here, significant correlations were observed between the novel peak performance questionnaire with the SCL-90-R and WHOQOL-Bref, confirming its construct and retest validity. Despite several methodological limitations, including a potential type-2 error, this study highlights limited effects of ILF-NFT in healthy volunteers. Future research should thus focus on clinically driven experimental designs to explore ILF-NFT's potential in psychiatric contexts. Further research utilization of the novel peak performance questionnaire is recommended for measures of peak performance.
