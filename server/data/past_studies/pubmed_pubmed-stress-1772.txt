Study Title: [acupuncture for subjective tinnitus:a randomized controlled trial].

Study Summary:
To observe the clinical effect ofacupuncture (acupuncture for promoting the circulation of the governor vessel and regulating the spirit) for subjective tinnitus, and explore its potential mechanism. A total of 92 patients with subjective tinnitus were randomly divided into an acupuncture group (46 cases, 5 cases dropped out) and a medication group (46 cases, 2 cases dropped out). The acupuncture group receivedacupuncture at Shuigou (GV 26), Yintang (GV 24), Shenting (GV 24), Baihui (GV 20), Fengfu (GV 16), Dazhui (GV 14) and Zhongzhu (TE 3), Tinghui (GB 2), Yifeng (TE 17) on the affected side, 30 min each time, once every other day, 3 times a week. The medication group was orally administered ginkgo biloba leaves tablets (40 mg each time) and mecobalamin tablets (0.5 mg each time), 3 times a day. Both groups were treated for 4 weeks. The scores of tinnitus severity, tinnitus loudness visual analogue scale (VAS) and depression anxiety stress scale-21(DASS-21) before and after treatment were observed in the two groups, serum level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) before and after treatment in the two groups was detected, and the clinical effect was evaluated in the two groups. After treatment&#xff0c;the scores of tinnitus severity, tinnitus loudness VAS and DASS-21 were decreased compared with those before treatment in the two groups (<0.01), and the scores in the acupuncture group were lower than those in the medication group (<0.05). After treatment, the serum level of BDNF was decreased compared with that before treatment in the two groups (<0.01), and the serum level of BDNF in the acupuncture group was lower than that in the medication group (<0.05). The total effective rate of the acupuncture group was 82.9% (34/41), which was higher than 70.5% (31/44) in the medication group (<0.05). acupuncture could improve the severity of tinnitus, tinnitus loudness and negative emotion in patients with subjective tinnitus. Its mechanism may be related to the regulation of serum level of BDNF and thus affect auditory central plasticity.
