Study Title: Impact of staged goal-directed fluid therapy on postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing McKeown esophagectomy: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Our aim was to evaluate the influence of staged goal directed therapy (GDT) on postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), intraoperative hemodynamics and oxygenation in patients undergoing Mckeown esophagectomy. Patients were randomly divided into three groups, staged GDT group (group A, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56): stroke volume variation (SVV) was set at 8-10% during the one lung ventilation (OLV) stage and 8-12% during the two lung ventilation (TLV) stage, GDT group (group B, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56): received GDT with a target SVV of 8-12% During the entire surgical procedure, and control group (group C, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56): conventional fluid therapy was administered by mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and urine volume. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications within Postoperative days (POD) 7. The secondary outcomes were postoperative lung ultrasound (LUS) B-lines artefacts (BLA) scoring, incidence of other complications, the length of hospital stay, intraoperative hemodynamic and oxygenation indicators included mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), cardiac output (CO), oxygenation index (OI), respiratory indices (RI), alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (Aa-DO). Patients in group A and group B had a lower incidence of PPCs (7/56 vs. 17/56 and 9/56 vs. 17/56, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), and a fewer B-lines score on postoperative ultrasound (4.61&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.51 vs. 6.15&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.74 and 4.75&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.62 vs. 6.15&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.74, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) compared to group C. The CI, CO, MAP, and OI were higher in group A compared to group B and group C in the stage of thoracic operation. During the abdominal operation stage, patients in group A and group B had a better hemodynamic and oxygenation indicators than group C. In comparison to conventional fluid therapy, intraoperative staged GDT can significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing McKeown esophagectomy, facilitating patient recovery. Compared to GDT, it can improve intraoperative oxygenation and stabilize intraoperative hemodynamics in patients.
