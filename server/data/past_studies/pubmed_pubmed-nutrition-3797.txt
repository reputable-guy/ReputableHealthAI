Study Title: Modifications of lung microbiota structure in traumatic brain injury ventilated patients according to time and enteral feeding formulas: a prospective randomized study.

Study Summary:
Specialized diets enriched with immune nutrients could be an important supplement in patients (pts) with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI). Omega-3 and arginine may interact with immune response and microbiota. No data are available about the role of the specialized diets in modulating the lung microbiota, and little is known about the influence of lung microbiota structure in development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in TBI pts. The aims of this study are to evaluate the impact of specific nutrients on the lung microbiota and the variation of lung microbiota in TBI pts developing VAP. A cohort of 31 TBI pts requiring mechanical ventilation in ICU was randomized for treatment with specialized (16pts) or standard nutrition (15pts). Alpha and beta diversity of lung microbiota were analyzed from bronco Alveolar Lavage (BAL) samples collected at admission and 7&#xa0;days post-ICU admission in both groups. A further analysis was carried out on the same samples retrospectively grouped in VAP or no VAP pts. None developed VAP in the first week. Thereafter, ten out of thirty-one pts developed VAP. The BAL microbiota on VAP group showed significant differences in beta diversity and Staphylococcus and Acinetobacter Genera were high. The specialized nutrition had influence on beta diversity that reached statistical significance only in Bray-Curtis distance. Our data suggest that TBI patients who developed VAP during ICU stay have different structures of BAL microbiota either at admission and at 7&#xa0;days post-ICU admission, while no correlation has been observed between different enteral formulas and microbiota composition in terms of richness and evenness. These findings suggest that targeting the lung microbiota may be a promising approach for preventing infections in critically ill patients.
