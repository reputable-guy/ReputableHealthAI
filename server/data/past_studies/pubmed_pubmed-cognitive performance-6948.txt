Study Title: Higher Adiposity Is Associated With Slower Cognitive Decline in Hypertensive Patients: Secondary Analysis of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial.

Study Summary:
Obesity is a risk factor for many diseases. However, the potential association between adiposity and cognitive decline in hypertensive patients is inconclusive. We performed a secondary data analysis of the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial) to examine whether adiposity is correlated with longitudinal cognitive performance in hypertensive adults. The analysis included 16&#xa0;791 patients in the CSPPT who received at least 2 cognitive assessments by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) during the follow-up (median, 4.5 years; interquartile range, 4.2-4.8 years). Outcomes included changes in MMSE scores and cognitive impairment (defined as MMSE score less than education-specific cutoff point). A&#xa0;marked reduction in MMSE scores at the final (compared with at the 1-year) follow-up was apparent in both men (n=4838; mean [SD] score, 0.41 [3.62]) and women (n=7190; mean [SD] score, 1.07 [4.61]; both<0.001). Analysis using a mixed-effects model revealed an association between higher body mass index with less MMSE decline, even after controlling for demographics and comorbidities (men, &#x3b2;=0.0134 [SE, 0.0036]; women, &#x3b2;=0.0133 [SE, 0.0034]; both<0.001). A total of 1037 men (15.3%) and 3317 women (33.1%) developed cognitive impairment. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, being obese in men (11.3% versus 18.0%; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.94) and women (30.1% versus 36.5%; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.91) was a protective factor against cognitive impairment compared with normal body mass index. Higher adiposity is independently associated with slower cognitive decline in Chinese hypertensive adults. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00794885 CSPPT.
