Study Title: Long-acting exenatide does not prevent cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment: a proof-of-concept clinical trial.

Study Summary:
According to preclinical evidence, GLP-1 receptor may be an actionable target in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists were conducted in patients with early AD, yielding mixed results. The aim was to assess in a proof-of-concept study whether slow-release exenatide, a long-acting GLP-1 agonist, can benefit the cognitive performance of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thirty-two (16 females) patients were randomized to either slow-release exenatide (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17; 2&#xa0;mg&#xa0;s.c. once a week) or no treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) for 32&#xa0;weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in ADAS-Cog11 cognitive test score at 32&#xa0;weeks vs baseline. Secondary endpoints herein reported included additional cognitive tests and plasma readouts of GLP-1 receptor engagement. Statistical analysis was conducted by intention to treat. No significant between-group effects of exenatide on ADAS-Cog11 score (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17) were detected. A gender interaction with treatment was observed (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), due to worsening of the ADAS-Cog11 score in women randomized to exenatide (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), after correction for age, scholar level, dysglycemia, and ADAS-Cog score baseline value. Fasting plasma glucose (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and body weight (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) decreased in patients randomized to exenatide. In patients with MCI, a 32-week trial with slow-release exenatide had no beneficial effect on cognitive performance. NCT03881371, registered on 21 July, 2016.
