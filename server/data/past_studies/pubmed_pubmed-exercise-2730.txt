Study Title: Evaluating the Impact of Seated Pilates on Functional Outcomes Among Those With Mild, Moderate, and Severe Multiple Sclerosis Impairment: A Pilot Feasibility Trial.

Study Summary:
This pilot study assessed the feasibility and functional benefits of a twice-weekly, 12-week, virtual, seated, group-based Pilates program in persons with mild to severe multiple sclerosis (MS). Participants were randomized into either a Pilates-only group or a Pilates group, which also incorporated hip and shoulder-cuff activation exercises. Process, management, and scientific-feasibility metrics were analyzed descriptively. Functional outcomes, physical activity, and MS-related outcomes (impact, fatigue, and quality of life) were measured pre- and postintervention and analyzed using mixed-effects models, analysis of variance, and cluster analysis. Twenty-two participants completed baseline testing. Sixteen completed the intervention and postintervention testing. Collapsed across groups, analyses demonstrated improvements in the Timed 25-Foot Walk (36%), Timed Up-and-Go (13%), and the Berg Balance Scale (10%, statistically significant). Neither between-groups differences nor physical activity or MS outcome changes were significant. Participants reported high satisfaction. Findings suggest that&#xa0;virtual, seated Pilates is feasible and may confer balance benefits to individuals with MS.
