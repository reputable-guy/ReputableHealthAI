Study Title: Efficacy of mindfulness added to treatment as usual in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse headache: a phase-III single-blind randomized-controlled trial (the MIND-CM study).

Study Summary:
Mindfulness gained considerable attention for migraine management, but RCTs are lacking. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a six-sessions mindfulness-based treatment added to treatment as usual (TaU) in patients with Chronic Migraine (CM) and Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) on headache frequency, medication intake, quality of life, disability, depression and anxiety, cutaneous allodynia, awareness of inner states, work-related difficulties, and disease cost. In this Phase-III single-blind RCT carried out in a specialty Italian headache center, 177 patients with CM and MOH were randomized 1:1 to either TaU (withdrawal from overused drugs, education on proper medication use and lifestyle issues, and tailored prophylaxis) or mindfulness-based intervention added to TaU (TaU&#x2009;+&#x2009;MIND). The mindfulness-based intervention consisted of six group session of mindfulness practice and 7-10&#xa0;min daily self-practice. The primary endpoint was the achievement of &#x2265;&#x2009;50% headache frequency reduction at 12 months compared to baseline, and was analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle using Pearson's Chi-Squared test. Secondary endpoints included medication intake, quality of life (QoL), disability, depression and anxiety, cutaneous allodynia, awareness of inner states, work-related difficulties, and disease cost. The secondary endpoints were analyzed using per-protocol linear mixed models. Out of the 177 participants 89 were randomized to TaU and 88 to TaU&#x2009;+&#x2009;MIND. Patients in the TaU&#x2009;+&#x2009;MIND group outperformed those in TaU for the primary endpoint (78.4% vs. 48.3%; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001), and showed superior improvement in headache frequency, QoL and disability, headache impact, loss of productive time, medication intake, and in total, indirect and direct healthcare costs. A mindfulness-based treatment composed of six-week session and 7-10&#xa0;min daily self-practice added on to TaU is superior to TaU alone for the treatment of patients with CM and MOH. MIND-CM was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03671681) on14/09/2018.
