Study Title: Multimodal benefits of hypnosis on pain, mental health, sleep, and quality of life in patients with chronic pain related to fibromyalgia: A randomized, controlled, blindly-evaluated trial.

Study Summary:
Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome marked by intense musculoskeletal pain often refractory to pharmacological treatment. Although studies have shown that hypnosis improves fibromyalgia pain, gaps in experimental design limit their reliability. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of hypnosis on pain, mental health, sleep, and quality of life in participants with fibromyalgia chronic pain. In this prospective, parallel, randomized, controlled, blindly-evaluated trial, participants of both sexes (n = 49) diagnosed with fibromyalgia and with moderate to severe chronic pain attended 8 weekly 1-h sessions with a hypnotherapist. For the hypnosis group (n = 24), sessions consisted in induction of hypnotic trance followed by suggestions to promote analgesia. For the control group (n = 25), sessions consisted in casual unscripted conversation. Participants were assessed at baseline (7 days before), post-intervention (7 days after), and follow-up (3 months after). The primary outcome was pain intensity. The secondary outcomes were the sensory and affective dimensions of pain; pain unpleasantness; pain catastrophizing; anxiety and depression; sleep quality; fibromyalgia impact; and quality of life. Hypnosis significantly reduced pain scores both at post-intervention and follow-up in comparison with baseline. The analgesic effect of hypnosis combined with pharmacological treatment lasted for at least 3 months and was superior to analgesia promoted by first- and second-line pharmacological treatment alone. Hypnosis significantly improved all parameters evaluated as secondary outcomes both at post-intervention and follow-up without inducing adverse events. Our results corroborate that clinical hypnosis is an effective and feasible tool for managing chronic pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia.
