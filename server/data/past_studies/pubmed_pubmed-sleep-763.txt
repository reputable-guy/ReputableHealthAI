Study Title: Online Exercise Programs for Chronic Nonspecific Neck Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial Reveals Comparable Effects of Global, Local, and Combined Approaches.

Study Summary:
Specific neck exercises are recommended in the rehabilitation of chronic nonspecific neck pain (CNNP). They are unfortunately often accompanied by acute pain flare-ups. Global exercises might be a beneficial addition, as they activate endogenous analgesia without overloading painful structures. However, it is still unclear which type of exercise is most effective. This randomized controlled trial was done to evaluate the effect of an online blended program of global and specific neck exercises, compared to programs including only 1 of both types of exercise. Forty-eight patients with CNNP were randomized into 3 groups. Online questionnaires were collected at baseline, at midtreatment, immediately after treatment, and at the 3-month follow-up. Quantitative sensory testing and actigraphy were assessed at baseline and after treatment. Linear mixed-model analyses were performed to evaluate treatment effects within and between groups. Neck pain-related disability after treatment was considered the primary outcome. No time &#xd7; treatment interaction effects were found. All groups improved in neck pain-related disability, pain intensity, self-reported symptoms of central sensitization, local pain sensitivity, physical activity, and pain medication use. No effects were found on quality of life, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, stress, widespread pain sensitivity, health economics, or actigraphy measurements. A higher global perceived effect was reported after performing the blended program, compared to the other groups. A blended exercise program was not superior to the stand-alone programs in reducing disability. Nevertheless, the global perceived effect of this type of exercise was higher. Future research necessitates larger sample sizes to adequately explore the optimal type of exercise for patients with CNNP. Exercise therapy should be an important part of the rehabilitation of patients with CNNP, regardless of the type of exercise.
