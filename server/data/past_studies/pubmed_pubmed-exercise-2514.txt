Study Title: Effect of different modalities of exercise on Fatty Liver Index in patients with metabolic syndrome: The RESOLVE randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Metabolic associated liver disease (MASLD) is the most common liver disease in the world especially in people with metabolic syndrome. First-line treatments mainly consist in lifestyle modifications for these populations. The main objective of this study is to assess the effect of a short intervention program with different exercise modalities on Fatty Liver Index (FLI) in patients with metabolic syndrome. 85 patients (40 men, 45 women) with metabolic syndrome and liver steatosis were randomized in 3 groups for a 3 weeks residential program: Re group-high-resistance-moderate-endurance; rE group-moderate-resistance with high-endurance and re group-moderate-resistance with moderate-endurance. Patients also followed a negative energy balance of 500 kcal/day. Then, a follow-up of 1 year with interviews with dieticians and exercise physicians to maintain lifestyle modification was performed. Anthropometric, cardiometabolic and hepatic outcomes were performed at baseline, at the end of the 3-week residential program, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after baseline. This study demonstrated that all three training programs significantly improve FLI and that this effect was lasting among the follow-up (p < 0.001). More specifically, the Re group exhibited a more pronounced decrease in FLI compared with re (p < 0.05). Finally, the decrease in FLI was associated with improvement in anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes at 3-weeks (p < 0.001) and 3-months (p < 0.01). Short duration program is effective to improve FLI and cardiometabolic parameters in MASLD patients. Encourage to increase physical activity even for a short duration is relevant in this population.
