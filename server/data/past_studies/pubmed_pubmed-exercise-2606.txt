Study Title: Digoxin and exercise effects on skeletal muscle Na,K-ATPase isoform gene expression in healthy humans.

Study Summary:
In muscle, digoxin inhibits Na,K-ATPase (NKA) whereas acute exercise can increase NKA gene expression, consistent with training-induced increased NKA content. We investigated whether oral digoxin increased NKA isoform mRNA expression (qPCR) in muscle at rest, during and post-exercise in 10 healthy adults, who received digoxin (DIG, 0.25&#xa0;mg per day) or placebo (CON) for 14 days, in a randomised, double-blind and cross-over design. Muscle was biopsied at rest, after cycling 20&#xa0;min (10&#xa0;min each at 33%, then 67%), then to fatigue at 90%and 3&#xa0;h post-exercise. No differences were found between DIG and CON for NKA &#x3b1;or &#x3b2;isoform mRNA. Both &#x3b1;(354%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001) and &#x3b2;mRNA (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008) were increased 3&#xa0;h post-exercise, with &#x3b1;and &#x3b2;mRNA unchanged, whilst &#x3b1;mRNA declined at fatigue (-43%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.045). In resting muscle, total &#x3b2; mRNA (&#x2211;(&#x3b2;+&#x3b2;+&#x3b2;)) increased in DIG (60%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025) and also when transcripts for each isoform were normalised to CON then either summed (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030) or pooled (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034). In contrast, total &#x3b1; mRNA (&#x2211;(&#x3b1;+&#x3b1;+&#x3b1;), P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.348), normalised then summed (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.332), or pooled transcripts (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.717) did not differ with DIG. At rest, NKA &#x3b1;and &#x3b2;protein abundances were unchanged by DIG. Post-exercise, &#x3b1;and &#x3b2;proteins were unchanged, but &#x3b1;declined at 3&#xa0;h (19%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.020). In conclusion, digoxin did not modify gene expression of individual NKA isoforms at rest or with exercise, indicating NKA gene expression was maintained consistent with protein abundances. However, elevated resting muscle total &#x3b2; mRNA with digoxin suggests a possible underlying &#x3b2; gene-stimulatory effect. HIGHLIGHTS: What is the central question of this study? Na,K-ATPase (NKA) in muscle is important for Na/Khomeostasis. We investigated whether the NKA-inhibitor digoxin stimulates increased NKA gene expression in muscle and exacerbates NKA gene responses to exercise in healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? Digoxin did not modify exercise effects on muscle NKA &#x3b1;and &#x3b2;gene transcripts, which comprised increased post-exercise &#x3b1;and &#x3b2;mRNA and reduced &#x3b1;mRNA during exercise. However, in resting muscle, digoxin increased NKA total &#x3b2; isoform mRNA expression. Despite inhibitory-digoxin or acute exercise stressors, NKA gene regulation in muscle is consistent with the maintenance of NKA protein contents.
