Study Title: Sleep hygiene measures combined with mindfulness meditation in the management of sleep bruxism in children: A randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Sleep hygiene measures and meditation may reduce stress and improve sleep quality, but their effect on the occurrence of sleep bruxism in children has not yet been investigated. To explore the effects of sleep hygiene measures combined with mindfulness meditation (relaxation audio) in the management of probable sleep bruxism (SB) in children. This clinical trial (no. NCT04501237) randomized 36 children with 3-8&#x2009;years of age. Probable SB detection was performed according to the criteria established by the International Consensus on The Assessment of Bruxism-2018. Intervention group was instructed to practice sleep hygiene measures and mindfulness meditation (i.e., the use of a digital app to broadcast audio relaxation) each night before bedtime for 5&#x2009;weeks; control group did not receive guidance for therapies. Parents completed a bruxism diary for 5&#x2009;weeks, and the outcome was the number of SB episodes-day reported in the week (ranging from 0 to 7) in each period. A multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression model was performed. A total of 32 children (mean age: 6.1&#x2009;years) completed the study. The children who received the therapies related to sleep hygiene measures and mindfulness meditation had a reduction in the SB incidence rate ratio (IRR)&#xa0;of 46% (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54 [Confidence Interval 95%, 0.45-0.65]) during a 5-week observation period. The sensitivity analyses did not show relevant changes in the measure of the effect. Sleep hygiene measures combined with mindfulness meditation reduced the SB in children.
