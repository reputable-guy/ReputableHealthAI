Study Title: Exploring Associations Between Device-Based Occupational Sedentary Behavior and Need for Recovery in White Collar Workers: A Compositional Data-Analysis.

Study Summary:
White collar workers spend an increasing amount of time in occupational sedentary behavior (OSB) and are thereby at risk for adverse health outcomes. Nevertheless, the association between OSB and the need for recovery (NFR), an important indicator of wellbeing, is unknown and therefore examined. Baseline data from a cluster randomized controlled trial was used. A subgroup of 89 white collar workers wore a triaxial accelerometer for 7&#xa0;days. NFR was measured using the Questionnaire on the Experience and Evaluation of Work. Compositional data analysis was applied to determine the composition of different OSB bouts (short, medium and long) and occupational physical activity (OPA) (light, moderate and vigorous and standing). Linear regression analyses were performed to explore the associations between occupational compositions and NFR. Relatively more time spent in long OSB bouts was associated with a lower NFR (&#x3b2;: -11.30, 95% CI: -20.2 to -2.4). Short and medium OSB bouts and OPA were not associated with NFR. Associations between OSB bouts, OPA and NFR hinted at contrasting trends, suggesting the need to consider different bout lengths of OSB in future studies.
