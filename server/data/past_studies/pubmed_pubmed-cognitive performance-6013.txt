Study Title: A new injury prevention program 'FUNBALL' improves cognitive performance of young football (soccer) players: A cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The youth football injury prevention program 'FUNBALL' contains exercises requiring high cognitive demands, which are performed concurrently to the training of the respective motor task. This study evaluates whether the program increases cognitive performances of young football players. 1253 football players (aged 13-19 years old) were randomly assigned to either a control (CON) or an intervention (INT) group. The INT group performed the 'FUNBALL' program at least twice per week in their training sessions for one season (9 months). The CON group continued their training routine. From the total sample, the cognitive performance of 304 players (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;135 CON; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;169 INT) was assessed at the beginning and the end of the season using the Cogstate&#xae; Brief Battery, with the following subtests: One Back test (accuracy), Two Back test (accuracy), One Card Learning test (accuracy), Chase Test (correct moves per second), Set Shifting (accuracy), Identification test (speed), Detection test (speed), Groton Maze Learning Test (accuracy), and Groton Maze Learning Test Delayed Recall (accuracy). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on the cognitive performance improvements from pre-to posttest showed that the INT group improved their performances more strongly than the CON group for all cognitive tests, namely for working memory, visual learning, visual motor control, attention, psychomotor function, memory, and executive function. The present study indicates that the exercise-based injury prevention program 'FUNBALL' may improve the cognitive performance of young football players. Future research should include an active control group, and should investigate whether the improvement in cognition also has beneficial effects on in-game performance.
