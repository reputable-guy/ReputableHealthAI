Study Title: Effects of oropharyngeal administration of own mother's milk on oral microbial colonization in very low birth weight infants fed by gastric tube: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of oropharyngeal mother's milk administration on oral microbial colonization in infants fed by gastric tube at different time points. Infants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;116) with birth weight <1500&#x2009;g were randomly allocated into two groups which both received breast milk for enteral nutrition. The control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51) accepted oropharyngeal normal saline administration. The experimental group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;53) accepted oropharyngeal mother's milk administration before fed by gastric tube once every 3&#x2009;h over 21 days after birth. We analyzed the oral microbiota at initiation and 7 and 14 and 21 days later using 16S DNA amplicon sequencing. There were no difference in oral microbial diversity between the two groups at any time point, but diversity decreased significantly over time in both groups. On the first day of life, the oral microbiota of the infant in the experimental and control groups consisted mainly of Firmicutes (7.75%, 6.18%) and Proteobacteria (68.65%, 68.69%), respectively. As time increases to 21 days after birth, Firmicutes (77.67%, 77.66%) had replaced Proteobacteria (68.65%, 68.69%) as the predominant phylum. From birth to 21 days after birth, oropharyngeal mother's milk administration did not change the diversity and structural composition of the oral microbiota. The oral microbial diversity of infants declined significantly over time. Firmicutes had replaced Proteobacteria as the predominant phylum.
