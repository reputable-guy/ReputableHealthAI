Study Title: Comparison of diclofenac with tramadol, tizanidine or placebo in the treatment of acute low back pain and sciatica: multi-center randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has posed numerous health and socioeconomic challenges. This study compared whether nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with tramadol, tizanidine or placebo would be the best treatment regime to improve the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores at 1 week. This was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial including adult patients with acute LBP and sciatica in three emergency departments in Hong Kong. Patients were randomized to the receive tramadol 50&#xa0;mg, tizanidine 2&#xa0;mg, or placebo every 6&#xa0;hours for 2&#xa0;weeks in a 1:1:1 ratio. The RMDQ and other secondary outcomes were measured at baseline, Day 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis. Crude and adjusted mean differences in the changes of RMDQ and NRS scores from baseline to Day 7 between tizanidine/tramadol and placebo were determined with 95% confidence intervals. Two hundred and ninety-one patients were analyzed with the mean age of 47.4&#xa0;years and 57.7% were male. The primary outcome of mean difference in RMDQs on Day 7 (compared with baseline) was non-significant for tizanidine compared with placebo (adjusted mean difference&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.56, 95% CI -2.48 to 1.37) and tramadol compared with placebo (adjusted mean difference&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.85, 95% CI -2.80 to 1.10). Only 23.7% were fully compliant to the treatment allocated. Complier Average Causal Effect analysis also showed no difference in the primary outcome for the tizanidine and tramadol versus placebo. Among patients with acute LBP and sciatica presenting to the ED, adding tramadol or tizanidine to diclofenac did not improve functional recovery.
