Study Title: Effect of Arm-Ergometry Versus Treadmill Supervised Exercise on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Walking Distances in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease: The ARMEX Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
To compare arm-ergometry and treadmill supervised exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness and walking distances in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). ARMEX was a single-center, single-blinded, parallel group, non-inferiority trial enrolling symptomatic patients with PAD. Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to a 12-wk arm-ergometry (AEx) or standard treadmill (TEx) supervised exercise training protocol. The powered primary end point was the change in peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 ) at 12 wk, measured on a treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Secondary outcomes included changes in VO 2 at the first ventilatory threshold (VT-1), ventilatory efficiency (ratio of minute ventilation [VE] to carbon dioxide production [VCO 2 ], VE/VCO 2 ), walking distances by CPX and 6-min walking test (6MWT), and self-reported walking limitations. Fifty-six patients (66&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8&#xa0;yr; 88% male) were randomized (AEx, n =&#xa0;28; TEx, n =&#xa0;28). At 12 wk, VO 2peak change was not significantly different between groups (0.75 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, -0.94 to 2.44; P =&#xa0;.378), despite a significant increase only in AEx. VO 2 at VT-1 improved in both groups without between-group differences, and VE/VCO 2 slope improved more in AEx. The TEx attained greater improvements in walking distance by CPX (121.08 m; 95% CI, 24.49-217.66; P =&#xa0;.015) and 6MWT (25.08 m; 95% CI, 5.87-44.29; P =&#xa0;.012) and self-perceived walking distance. Arm-ergometry was noninferior to standard treadmill training for VO 2peak , and treadmill training was associated with greater improvements in walking distance. Our data support the use of treadmill as a first-line choice in patients with PAD to enhance walking capacity, but arm-ergometry could be an option in selected patients.
