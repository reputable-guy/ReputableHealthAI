Study Title: Implementation of a pharmacy residency wellness program: Impact on burnout and mindfulness and lessons learned.

Study Summary:
Attention to wellness in the pharmacy workplace is occurring. To maintain accreditation, pharmacy residency programs must incorporate wellness and resilience initiatives. Orlando Health created a pharmacy residency wellness program for post-graduate year one (PGY-1) and post-graduate year two (PGY-2) pharmacy residents to address wellness and burnout. The wellness program included assignment of a mentor, development of a personal wellness plan, completion of monthly reflections, and wellness and resiliency training. Pharmacy residents anonymously completed the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) at the beginning and end of the residency year. A total of nine pharmacy residents were eligible to participate in the wellness program. Eight residents completed the pre-survey, and seven residents completed the post-survey. No change was observed in the overall median OLBI score (pre-program&#xa0;=&#xa0;35 [IQR 31.5-37.3] and post-program&#xa0;=&#xa0;36 [IQR 31-37.5]; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.683). Similar results were found on the OLBI for disengagement and exhaustion, correlating with low burnout risk. There was no change in the overall median MAAS score (pre-program&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.7 [IQR 3.6-4.1] and post-program&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.8 [IQR 3.5-3.9]; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.000). Overall, feedback from the pharmacy residents after program completion was positive. Pharmacy residents participating in the wellness program at our institution had low risk for burnout and a high level of mindfulness pre- and post-program completion. Pharmacy residents enjoyed participating in the wellness program and found the program to be valuable, supporting its continued implementation.
