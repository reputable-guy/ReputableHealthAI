Study Title: Exercise in primary care after robot-assisted radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer - effects on postoperative complications: a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
An exercise programme in primary care soon after radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer was previously evaluated regarding its effects on physical function. A secondary aim, presented herein, was to evaluate the programme in terms of its effect on postoperative complications. Patients who were planned for robot-assisted radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer at Karolinska University Hospital between September 2019 and October 2022 were invited to participate. At discharge from hospital, they were randomised to intervention group including aerobic and resistance exercises with physiotherapist in primary care twice a week for 12 weeks and daily walks, or to unsupervised home-based exercise including daily walks. Readmission rates between 30 and 90 days after discharge, and complications according to Clavien Dindo were collected from the medical records and analysed. Ninety patients were randomised, with a mean (SD) age of 72 (9) years. Readmission rates between 30 and 90 days showed no difference between the groups. For readmitted patients, the intervention group had significantly fewer complications reported as Clavien Dindo grade 2 compared to the control group.&#xa0; Conclusion: An exercise programme in primary care soon after robot-assisted radical cystectomy appears to be safe for patients, as measured by hospital readmission rates.&#xa0; Trial registration: Clinical Trials (NCT03998579).
