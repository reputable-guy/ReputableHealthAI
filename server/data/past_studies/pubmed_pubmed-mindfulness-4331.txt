Study Title: Improving physician wellness through the Applied Mindfulness Program for Medical Personnel: findings from a prospective qualitative study.

Study Summary:
Physicians play a critical role across health care delivery systems, yet their own well-being is often overlooked; mindfulness has been widely recommended as a promising modality to support physician wellness. We sought to explore how physicians experience and engage with a 5-week applied mindfulness program and how they perceive its impact on their personal well-being in the context of their daily lives. We delivered the Applied Mindfulness Program for Medical Personnel (AMP-MP) at a tertiary care hospital in downtown Toronto, Canada. This prospective qualitative study consists of a thematic analysis of post-program interviews with physicians, from across different specialties, who participated in the AMP-MP. The program includes 2-hour sessions, delivered once a week over 5 weeks, and is based on the teachings of Th&#xed;ch Nh&#x1ea5;t H&#x1ea1;nh. We interviewed 28 physicians after they completed the AMP-MP. Our data show that a 5-week training was sufficient for physicians to develop a foundational level of mindfulness that integrated into their daily life. Two themes were identified: mindfulness encourages behavioural and cognitive changes that facilitate well-being, and mindfulness improves communication with patients and colleagues. Our results show applied mindfulness to be well received by physicians as an effective modality to increase their perceived sense of wellness and enhance communication with their patients and colleagues. Further research is necessary to better understand the individual and systemic implications of mindfulness training, and how this modality can complement other efforts being made to address and maintain physician wellness.
