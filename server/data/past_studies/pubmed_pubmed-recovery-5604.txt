Study Title: Safety and feasibility of early drinking water after general anesthesia recovery in patients undergoing daytime surgery.

Study Summary:
Patients who are recovering from general anesthesia commonly exhibit symptoms such as dry lips, throat irritation, and thirst, prompting a desire to drink water in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects and any potential complications of administering varying quantities of water to such patients. The primary objectives are to assess the safety and feasibility of early water intake after general anesthesia, specifically in the context of daytime surgery. A total of 200 nongastrointestinal patients who underwent outpatient surgery were randomly assigned to four groups: Group A (drinking&#x2009;<&#x2009;1&#xa0;ml/kg), Group B (drinking 1-2&#xa0;ml/kg), Group C (drinking&#x2009;>&#x2009;2&#xa0;ml/kg), and Group D (no water intake). We monitored changes in the assessment parameters before and after water consumption, as well as the incidence of post-drinking nausea and vomiting, and compared these outcomes among the four groups. Water intake led to a significant reduction in thirst, oropharyngeal discomfort, and pain scores and a notable increase in the gastric antrum motility index (MI), exhibiting statistical significance compared to the values before drinking (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Remarkably, higher water consumption correlated with enhanced gastrointestinal peristalsis. There was a significant difference in the antral MI among groups B, C, and A (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The occurrence of nausea and vomiting did not significantly differ among groups A, B, C, and D (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Early water consumption enhanced patient satisfaction with medical care, significantly varying from Group D (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Non-gastrointestinal surgical patients who passed pre-drinking water assessments post GA(general anesthesia)recovery could safely ingest moderate amounts of water in the PACU. Early water intake is both safe and feasible, effectively fostering swift postoperative recovery.
