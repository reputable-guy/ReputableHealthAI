Study Title: Effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle program based on a mobile serious game for childhood cancer survivors: A quasi-randomized trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle program based on a mobile serious game (HLP-MSG) to enhance the lifestyles of childhood cancer survivors (CCSs). This program proceeded in two stages: development and evaluation, using a non-synchronized design with a quasi-randomized trial. The participants were CCSs aged 6-13&#xa0;years whose treatment was terminated at least 12&#xa0;months prior. Data were collected at baseline, and post-intervention, with a follow-up after four weeks using the Child Healthy Lifestyle Profile (CHLP). The experimental (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26) and control groups (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25) were compared. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and repeated-measures ANOVA. The HLP-MSG promoted a healthy lifestyle by solving 26 quests, including seven sub-elements (nutrition, exercise, hygiene, interpersonal relationships, stress management, meaning of life, and health responsibility). This study revealed significant differences in the interaction between measurement time and group assignment in the CHLP (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.006) and physical activity (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.013), one of the seven sub-dimensions. A healthy lifestyle program based on a mobile serious game is a feasible health education modality to enhance the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual health of CCSs. The findings add to scientific evidence on a mobile serious game for health education among CCSs. The HLP-MSG provides an evolutionary educational modality that can be delivered non-face-to-face to promote CCSs' continuous healthy behavior maintenance. Moreover, the HLP-MSG is adolescent-friendly and can be utilized as a healthcare tool for parents and children to cooperate.
