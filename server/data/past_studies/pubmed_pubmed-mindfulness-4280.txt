Study Title: Web-Based Compassion Interventions for Family Caregivers' Mental Well-Being: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Study Summary:
To assess the effectiveness of web-based compassion interventions on the mental well-being of family caregivers. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials of web-based compassion intervention for family caregivers. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Proquest were searched from database inception until manuscript submission date. Eligible studies included family caregivers participating in web-based compassionate interventions with reported mental wellness indicators, such as self-compassion. Two independent researchers conducted a literature review, extracted data, and assessed the quality of each study using the risk of bias 2 tool. Random effects meta-analysis was performed to pool the data, followed by subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and Egger's tests. Of 1095 studies evaluated, 8 randomized controlled trials (encompassing 1978 participants) were included, with 75% exhibiting low risk of bias and high-quality evidence. Meta-analysis results indicated positive effects of web-based compassion interventions on family caregivers' self-compassion [standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.33; 95% CI, 0.08-0.58; P&#xa0;= .009] and mindfulness (SMD, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.03-0.90; P&#xa0;= .04). These interventions also demonstrated a positive impact on reducing stress (SMD,&#xa0;-0.32; 95% CI,&#xa0;-0.59 to&#xa0;-0.04; P&#xa0;= .02) and anxiety (SMD,&#xa0;-0.28; 95% CI,&#xa0;-0.47 to&#xa0;-0.09; P&#xa0;= .003). Subgroup analyses highlighted superior self-compassion outcomes for caregivers supporting individuals with mental illness and cancer compared with those caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Interventions lasting &#x2265;8&#xa0;weeks were the most common and effective. Web-based compassion interventions benefit family caregivers by enhancing self-compassion, mindfulness, and reducing anxiety and stress. More well-designed studies are suggested for future clinical applications.
