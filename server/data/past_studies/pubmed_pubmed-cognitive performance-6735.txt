Study Title: Effect of 2000 IU compared with 800 IU vitamin D on cognitive performance among adults age 60 years and older: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Findings on the effects of vitamin D on cognitive performance have been inconsistent and no clinical trials with detailed cognitive testing in healthy older adults have been reported. We tested whether 2000 IU is superior to 800 IU vitamin D3/d for cognitive performance among relatively healthy older adults. We analyzed data on cognitive performance as the secondary outcome of a 2-y double-blind randomized controlled trial that originally investigated the effect of vitamin D3 on knee function and pain in seniors with osteoarthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to either 2000 or 800 IU vitamin D3/d. Capsules had identical appearances and taste. A total of 273 community-dwelling older adults aged &#x2265;60 y were enrolled 6-8 wk after unilateral joint replacement. Inclusion required a baseline Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24. We implemented a detailed 2-h cognitive test battery. The primary cognitive endpoint was the score achieved in the MMSE. Secondary endpoints included a composite score of 7 executive function tests, auditory verbal and visual design learning tests, and reaction times. At baseline, mean age was 70.3 y, 31.4% were vitamin D-deficient [25(OH)D&#xa0;<20 ng/mL], and mean &#xb1; SD MMSE score was 28.0 &#xb1; 1.5. Although the mean &#xb1; SD 25(OH)D concentrations achieved differed significantly between treatment groups at 24-mo follow-up (2000 IU&#xa0;=&#xa0;45.1 &#xb1; 10.2 ng/mL; 800 IU&#xa0;=&#xa0;37.5 &#xb1; 8.8 ng/mL; P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001), none of the primary or secondary endpoints of cognitive performance differed between treatment group. Results by treatment were similar for predefined subgroups of baseline 25(OH)D status (deficient compared with replete) and age (60-69 y compared with &#x2265;70 y). Our study does not support a superior cognitive benefit of 2000 IU compared with 800 IU vitamin D/d among relatively healthy older adults over a 24-mo treatment period. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00599807.
