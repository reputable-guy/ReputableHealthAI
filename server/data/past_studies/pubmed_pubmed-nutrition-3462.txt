Study Title: Theory-based obesity intervention program for women: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
To determine the effect of the education and counseling intervention given to overweight and obese women according to the theory of planned behavior on their health behaviors. The study consisted of 78 overweight and obese women in total, between the ages of 18-49. While the women in the intervention group were given a 6-month training program and 6-month counseling service structured according to the theory of planned behavior, the women in the control group were given standard obesity training and were put on hold for 6&#x2009;months. There was a decrease in the post-test anthropometric measurement values of the intervention group compared to the pretest. While there was no statistically significant change in the activity status of the control group over time, the inactivity rate of the intervention group decreased; however, the minimal activity rate increased over time. The post-test healthy life style behaviors scale II health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, stress management and total scores of the intervention group were higher than those of the control group, and the differences were significant. It has been determined that the education and counseling services applied to overweight and obese women based on the theory of planned behavior are effective in gaining positive health behaviors.
