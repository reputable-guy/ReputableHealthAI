Study Title: The impact of modified Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy in social adjustment functions of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and their parents' stress levels: A nonrandomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This study aims to investigate the potential of a modified Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) intervention in promoting social adjustment and reducing their parental stress among children exhibiting symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The research also highlights the mechanisms and advantages of employing modified CBGT to address negative symptoms associated with ADHD in children. The study was conducted at Fuzhou Children's Hospital of Fujian Province, with a total of 20 pairs of parents and children with ADHD participating. The assessment utilized measures including SNAP, Barratt Impulsivity, and Conners to evaluate changes in the children's social adjustment abilities and core/associated ADHD symptoms before and after CBGT intervention. Additionally, the Parental Stress Index was employed to gauge the level of stress experienced by the parents. Consequently, CBGT interventions have shown substantial improvements in children's social adjustment abilities and have proven to be a significant source of stress relief for parents.
