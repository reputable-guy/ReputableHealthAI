Study Title: A Novel Herbal Composition Alleviates Functional Constipation, Reduces Gastrointestinal Transit Time, and Improves Bowel Function in Adults: A Double-Blind, Randomized Clinical Study.

Study Summary:
A recent proof-of-concept pilot clinical study has demonstrated that consumption of CL18100F4, a proprietary herbal blend ofroot andfruit extracts, significantly relieved the participants from functional constipation and improved their quality of life. The objective of the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to reevaluate the efficacy and tolerability of CL18100F4 in a larger number of subjects. Male and female subjects (&#x2009;=&#x2009;135; age: 25-60&#x2009;years), selected through Rome-IV criteria for functional constipation, were randomized into placebo and 300 or 500&#x2009;mg of CL18100F4 groups and supplemented daily over 60 consecutive days. The primary efficacy outcome measure was Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM), evaluated at baseline and on days 7, 30, and 60 of supplementation. The secondary efficacy parameters included Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL), Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores, Gastrointestinal Transit Time (GIT), and Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM). Serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, cortisol, gastrin, serotonin, Diamine oxidase (DAO), and Zonulin were measured. CL18100F4 supplementation significantly (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) reduced the PAC-SYM, PAC-QOL, GSRS scores, and GIT and improved CSBM scores. CL18100F4 significantly improved (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) sleep quality and decreased depression and anxiety symptoms in the participants. Notably, relief in constipation symptoms and improved gastrointestinal (GI) function were reported starting from day 7. Furthermore, CL18100F4 supplementation significantly (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) increased the serum levels of IL-10, DAO, serotonin, gastrin, reduced IL-6, cortisol, and Zonulin. No major adverse events were observed. Participants' vital signs, hematology, clinical biochemistry, and urinalysis parameters were within the normal ranges. The present investigation demonstrates that CL18100F4 is tolerable and efficacious in relieving functional constipation, alleviating GI dysfunction, and improving associated non-GI factors in male and female adults.
