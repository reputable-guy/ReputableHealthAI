Study Title: Impact of a Mindfulness Mobile Application on Weight Loss and Eating Behavior in People with Metabolic Syndrome: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Weight-loss approaches involving mindfulness have been reported to reduce overeating behavior. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of a mindfulness mobile application (MMA) combined with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention (CLI) focused on weight loss and eating behaviors for people with metabolic syndrome based on post-intervention follow-up data. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a CLI group or a CLI&#x2009;+&#x2009;MMA group. Participants received weekly CLI for 13&#xa0;weeks, followed by telephone counseling for 13&#xa0;weeks. The CLI&#x2009;+&#x2009;MMA group also had access to the MMA. Feasibility was assessed by the number of people who refused to participate, rate of adherence to the MMA, follow-up rate, and participant satisfaction. The preliminary endpoint was weight change (at 26&#xa0;weeks). Participants completed the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ). A mixed linear model was used for efficacy analysis. Eight of the 40 participants declined to participate. The MMA was used 4.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.7&#xa0;days per week, but the rate of adherence declined over time. The follow-up rate was 100%, and there was no difference in participant satisfaction between the groups. There was no significant group-by-time interaction for weight loss (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.924), but there was a significant interaction for the DEBQ restrained eating score (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033). This study found that CLI plus MMA was highly feasible and moderately acceptable. There were no significant differences in weight loss between the groups, but the CLI&#x2009;+&#x2009;MMA group showed an increase in restrained eating. Further large-scale studies are needed.
