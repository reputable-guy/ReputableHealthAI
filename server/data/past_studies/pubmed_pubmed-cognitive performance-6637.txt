Study Title: Carbohydrate mouth rinse has no effects on behavioral or neuroelectric indices of cognition.

Study Summary:
Rinsing the mouth with a carbohydrate solution has been suggested as a means to enhance aspects of both physical and cognitive performance. However, evidence in support of these assertions is relatively weak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a carbohydrate mouth rinse solution on motor speed, inhibition, and sustained attention as indexed by both behavioral and neuroelectric measures. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects crossover design, 50 college-aged young adults performed a battery of cognitive tasks both before and after rinsing their mouth for 10&#xa0;s with 20&#xa0;mL of either a carbohydrate mouth rinse solution or a sensory-matched placebo control solution. A simple tapping task was used as a measure of motor speed, a modified Eriksen flanker task was used to index inhibition, and a rapid visual information processing task was used as a measure of sustained attention. Participants demonstrated longer reaction times in the Flanker task after rinsing their mouths with the carbohydrate mouth rinse, relative to pretest. No differences in reaction time were observed for the placebo control condition. P3 latency in the Flanker task as an index of attentional processing speed was shorter at posttest than at pretest in the placebo control - but not the carbohydrate mouth rinse - condition. These results suggest that despite claims of cognitive enhancement, carbohydrate mouth rinses do not appear to alter motor speed, inhibition, or sustained attention as compared to a placebo control in non-physically-fatigued college-aged adults.
