Study Title: App-based mindfulness meditation reduces perceived stress and improves self-regulation in working university students: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
We investigated whether a brief mindfulness meditation programme delivered via a smartphone app improves perceived stress, self-regulation and life satisfaction in part-time working university students. Mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal were analysed as potential mediators. A total of 64 university students working at least 20&#x2009;h per week during the semester were randomised to either a mindfulness-based mobile intervention or a wait-list control condition. Participants in the intervention group were asked to complete one training session of 10-15&#xa0;min per day using the app. Psychological measures were assessed via a self-report questionnaire at baseline and after 8&#xa0;weeks. The online mindfulness programme was found to significantly decrease perceived stress (&#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.180, a large effect). It also increased self-regulation (&#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.195, a large effect), mindfulness (&#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.174; a large effect) and cognitive reappraisal (&#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.136, a medium effect). Increments in life satisfaction were not significant. Changes in self-regulation were mediated by increased mindfulness. Overall, the mobile application was effective in improving mental well-being and coping abilities in a non-clinical sample, encouraging further development of digital health treatments.
