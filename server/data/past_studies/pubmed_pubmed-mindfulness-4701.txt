Study Title: Effects of animal-assisted psychotherapy incorporating mindfulness and self-compassion in neurorehabilitation: a randomized controlled feasibility trial.

Study Summary:
Transdiagnostic psychotherapeutic approaches are increasingly used in neurorehabilitation to address psychological distress. Animal-assistance is thought to increase efficacy. The present study evaluates a psychotherapeutic mindfulness- and self-compassion-based group intervention (MSCBI) with and without animal-assistance for patients with acquired brain injury. Patients (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) were randomly assigned to the 6-week intervention with (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14) or without animal-assistance (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17). Primary outcome was psychological distress at post- and follow-up&#xa0;treatment, secondary outcomes were changes within-session of patients' emotional states, adherence to treatment and attrition. Psychological distress significantly decreased in both groups from pre- to follow-up&#xa0;treatment with no difference between groups. Patients in the animal-assisted MSCBI group reported significantly higher increases in feeling secure, accepted, comforted, grateful, motivated and at ease during the sessions compared to patients in the MSCBI group without animal-assistance. Adherence to sessions was significantly higher in the animal-assisted MSCBI group. Attrition did not significantly differ between groups. Our results show that both MSCBIs with and without animal-assistance are feasible and effective in reducing psychological distress in patients with acquired brain injury. The significant changes within-sessions mainly in relationship-based emotional states and the higher treatment&#xa0;adherence suggest additional effects of animal-assistance. Animal-assistance might increase acceptability and patients' commitment to psychotherapy.
