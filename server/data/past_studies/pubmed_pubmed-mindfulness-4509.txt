Study Title: Mindfulness Using a Wearable Brain Sensing Device for Health Care Professionals During a Pandemic: A Pilot Program.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this feasibility pilot study was to evaluate safety and adherence of a wearable brain sensing wellness device designed to reduce stress among healthcare professionals (HCP). A total of 40 HCP were invited to participate in an open-label pilot study. Participants were asked to use a brain sensing wearable device (MUSE-S&#x2122;) on a daily basis to reduce their stress, for a total of 90&#x2009;days. Total study participation duration was 180&#x2009;days. Study enrollment began in August 2021 and ended December 2021. The exploratory outcomes included stress, depression, sleep, burn-out, resilience, quality of life, and cognition. Among the 40 HCP in study, the majority were female (85%), white (87.5%) and with an average age of 41.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.0&#x2009;years (SD). Participants used the wearable device an average of 23.8 times over a 30-day period with a mean duration of 5.8&#x2009;min with each use. Study results demonstrate the positive impact of guided mindfulness using the wearable device MUSE-S&#x2122; and its accompanying application (APP). A statistically significant improvement was found for a reduction in stress (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) and improvement in resilience (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02), quality of life (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.003), and cognition (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). The majority (91.9%) of the participants indicated they felt more relaxed after using the device, and 73% indicated they would continue to use this device at end-of-study. No adverse effects were reported. Study results show that 3 to 10&#x2009;min of guided meditation during work hours through the use of a brain sensing wearable device is safe and acceptable, with associated health benefits for HCP.
