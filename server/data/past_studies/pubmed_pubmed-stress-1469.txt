Study Title: Evaluation of the Potential Beneficial Effects ofL. Extract Supplementation in Postmenopausal Discomfort.

Study Summary:
Peri-menopausal discomfort can have a detrimental effect on the physical health of women due to physiological and behavioral changes. Estrogen and progesterone-based hormone therapy can alleviate menopausal symptoms, but estrogen supplementation may have negative health effects. The effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy using natural compounds for peri-menopausal disorders is still uncertain. Evidence from in vivo experiments indicates thatL. extract in ovariectomized rats leads to better sexual behavior. The effect seems to be linked to the phytoestrogenic properties of ferutinin, the primary bioactive compound in the extract. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical impact ofL. extract (titrated at 20% ferutinin, and given at doses of 100 mg/die for 90 days) on the quality of life of 64 menopausal women. The clinical trial was randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled. Our data showed thatL. extract reduced by 67 + 9% all symptoms associated to postmenopausal discomfort and enhanced significantly sexual behavior. In addition, the supplement led to a significant improvement of BMI and oxidative stress decrease in the women who received it, while also keeping platelet aggregation within normal levels. Overall, these results could point to the potential use of supplementation withL. extract to revert or mitigate menopause dysfunction.
