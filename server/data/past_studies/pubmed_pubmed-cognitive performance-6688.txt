Study Title: Cognitive function assessment during 2 mA transcranial direct current stimulation in DLPFC in healthy volunteers.

Study Summary:
Although cognitive function has been reported to change following the anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) but still variable results have been reported in healthy subject and there is paucity of data on the cognitive effects of online tDCS. Therefore, we aimed to assess the online effect of tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on cognitive function and obtain safety data in healthy adults. We recruited 36 healthy (20 male) participants for this double-blind, sham-controlled parallel design. We used Stop Signal Task (SST) Go Trial and Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM) tests to evaluate cognitive function during 2&#xa0;mA (20&#xa0;min) anodal or sham tDCS stimulation over the left DLPFC. In active conditions, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was selected for electrode placement with reference over right supraorbital cortex. All related tasks were done during the online tDCS section in both groups (active/sham). There were statistically significant differences in cognitive function according to the PRM test (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003), SST (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.021), and SST correct response time on Go Trials (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) during active stimulation compared to the sham group. Our results reveal that cognitive performance is affected by a single dose of active online tDCS over DLPFC area compared to sham stimulation. In our study, tDCS is well-tolerated and safe that further supports the safety of tDCS in local healthy population.
