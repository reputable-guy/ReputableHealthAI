Study Title: Muscular Function Recovery from General Anesthesia in 132 Patients Undergoing Surgery with Acceleromyography, Combined Acceleromyography, and Ultrasonography, and without Monitoring Muscular Function.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND Diaphragmatic thickness fraction (DTF), measured by ultrasound, can predict the occurrence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB). We hypothesized that the utilization of diaphragmatic ultrasound during the postoperative awakening phase of anesthesia in patients offers a successful means of avoiding RNMB in a notably comfortable manner, as compared to the use of acceleromyograph. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients who underwent elective thyroid cancer radical surgery were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 1) combined ultrasonography with acceleromyography group (the US+AMG group), 2) the AMG group, or 3) the usual clinical practice group (the UCP group). The primary outcomes of the study were the incidence of RNMB and hypoxemia after tracheal extubation. RESULTS The study included a total of 127 patients (43 in the US+AMG group, 44 in the AMG group, and 40 in the UCP group). The incidence of RNMB and hypoxemia was higher in the UCP group than in the US+AMG and AMG groups at 15 and 30 min after extubation, respectively. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the decision curve of the recovery rate of DTF (DTF) was greater than that of DTF. CONCLUSIONS The use of diaphragm ultrasound during the postoperative awakening phase of anesthesia can significantly reduce the incidence of RNMB. This method was non-inferior to the use of AMG during the entire perioperative period.
