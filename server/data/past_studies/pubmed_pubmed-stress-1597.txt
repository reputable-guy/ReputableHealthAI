Study Title: The "glass shoulder": Patients' lived experiences of a traumatic shoulder dislocation - A qualitative study.

Study Summary:
Anterior shoulder dislocations have a high recurrence rate, often necessitating stabilizing surgery, with residual long-term fear of reinjury. To explore patients' experiences of anterior shoulder dislocations in relation to their lives, well-being, fear of reinjury, and future perspectives. Qualitative study. We interviewed fourteen individuals (median age 27.5&#xa0;yrs, range 21-40; two women) with traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocation within 5 years, with or without past stabilizing surgery. We analysed data using Interpretive Description. We constructed three main themes. (1) Downward wellness spiral: The injury shattered their lives, influencing their self-identity and -confidence. Sleep disturbances added to stress levels, loss, depression and grief. The re-injury risk could lead to social isolation. (2) Out of arm's reach: Recurrences led to frustration as the prior surgery and rehabilitation appeared to have been unsuccessful, having to start again. Support from healthcare providers and wh&#x101;nau/family was crucial to regain trust in the body. (3) Obligatory compromise: Over time, some individuals accepted the re-injury risk, learnt to heed warning signals, or compromised by avoiding specific social and recreational activities, changing their sports or to other roles in their preferred sport, and adapting work-related and daily tasks. Participants described in-depth socio-emotional responses following shoulder dislocations. Most participants described an ongoing interplay between fear and confidence in their shoulder. Healthcare provider support and professional relationship, on-going shoulder-related strengthening, and risk mitigation strategies were important to facilitate and maintain confidence and self-efficacy, and to re-consider and adjust the participant's goals when needed.
