Study Title: Clinical application of tranexamic acid in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate whether intravenous administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) prior to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair improves operative blood loss, postoperative fibrinolytic index, inflammatory response, and postoperative pain. This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study. From January 2023 to February 2024, 64 patients who required arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were included and divided into tranexamic acid group (T group) group and control group (C group) according to the random number table method. In T group, 1000&#x2009;mg TXA was administered intravenously 10 minutes before surgery, and an equivalent dose of normal saline was administered intravenously 10 minutes before surgery in C group. Intraoperative bleeding, postoperative fibrinolytic indexes, inflammatory indexes, pain scores, and occurrence of adverse effects were compared between the 2 groups. Intraoperative bleeding in T group was lower than that in C group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); D-D and FDP in T group were significantly lower than those in C group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); postoperative TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-6 in 2 groups was higher than that before operation and T group was lower than C group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); The pain scores of the 2 groups after operation were lower than those before operation (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05), and there was no difference between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). TXA is able to reduce blood loss and inflammatory reactions, modulate fibrinolytic function, and promote postoperative recovery in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, with no elevated risk of complications.
