Study Title: Optimal Prescription for Superior Outcomes: A Comparative Analysis of Inter-Individual Variability in Adaptations to Small-Sided Games and Short Sprint Interval Training in Young Basketball Players.

Study Summary:
This study compared the inter-individual variability in adaptive responses to six weeks of small-sided games (SSG) and short sprint interval training (sSIT) in young basketball players. Thirty well-trained young athletes (age: 16.4 &#xb1; 0.6 years; stature: 190 &#xb1; 8.4 cm; weight: 84.1 &#xb1; 8.2 kg) voluntarily participated and were randomly assigned to SSG (3 sets of 5 min 3v3 on full length (28 m) and half-width (7.5 m) court, with 2 minutes of passive recovery in-between), sSIT (3 sets of 12 &#xd7; 5 s sprinting with 20 s recovery between efforts and 2 min of rest between sets), or CON (routine basketball-specific technical and tactical drills) groups, each of ten. Before and after the training period, participants underwent a series of laboratory- and field-based measurements to evaluate their maximum oxygen uptake (V&#x307;O), first and second ventilatory threshold (VTand VT), oxygen pulse, peak and average power output (PPO and APO), linear speed, change of direction (COD), countermovement jump (CMJ), and vertical jump (VJ). Both SSG and sSIT sufficiently stimulated adaptive mechanisms involved in enhancement of the mentioned variables (< 0.05). However, sSIT resulted in lower residuals in percent changes in V&#x307;O(= 0.02), Opulse (= 0.005), VT(= 0.001), PPO (= 0.03), and linear speed (= 0.01) across athletes compared to the SSG. Moreover, sSIT resulted in more responders than SSG in V&#x307;O(= 0.02, &#x3c6; = 0.500), Opulse (= 0.003, &#x3c6; = 0.655), VT(= 0.003, &#x3c6; = 0.655), VT(= 0.05, &#x3c6; = 0.436), and linear speed (= 0.05, &#x3c6; = 0.420). Our results indicate that sSIT creates a more consistent level of mechanical and physiological stimulus than SSG, potentially leading to more similar adaptations across team members.
