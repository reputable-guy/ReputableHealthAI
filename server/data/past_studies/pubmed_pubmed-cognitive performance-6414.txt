Study Title: Longer-term soy nut consumption improves cerebral blood flow and psychomotor speed: results of a randomized, controlled crossover trial in older men and women.

Study Summary:
Effects of soy foods on cerebral blood flow (CBF)-a marker of cerebrovascular function-may contribute to the beneficial effects of plant-based diets on cognitive performance. We aimed to investigate longer-term effects of soy nut consumption on CBF in older adults. Changes in 3 different domains of cognitive performance were also studied. Twenty-three healthy participants (age: 60-70 y; BMI: 20-30&#xa0;kg/m2) participated in a randomized, controlled, single-blinded crossover trial with an intervention (67&#xa0;g/d of soy nuts providing &#x223c;25.5&#xa0;g protein and 174&#xa0;mg isoflavones) and control period (no nuts) of 16 wk, separated by an 8-wk washout period. Adults followed the Dutch food-based dietary guidelines. At the end of each period, CBF was assessed with arterial spin labeling MRI. Psychomotor speed, executive function, and memory were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). No serious adverse events were reported, and soy nut intake was well tolerated. Body weights remained stable during the study. Serum isoflavone concentrations increased (daidzein mean difference&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD: 128&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;113&#xa0;ng/mL, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; genistein: 454&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;256&#xa0;ng/mL, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), indicating excellent compliance. Regional CBF increased in 4 brain clusters located in the left occipital and temporal lobes (mean &#xb1; SD increase: 11.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;12.4&#xa0;mL &#xb7; 100&#xa0;g-1 &#xb7; min-1, volume: 11,296 mm3, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), bilateral occipital lobe (12.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;15.0&#xa0;mL &#xb7; 100&#xa0;g-1 &#xb7; min-1, volume: 2632 mm3, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002), right occipital and parietal lobes (12.7&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;14.3&#xa0;mL &#xb7; 100&#xa0;g-1 &#xb7; min-1, volume: 2280 mm3, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005), and left frontal lobe (12.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;14.5&#xa0;mL &#xb7; 100&#xa0;g-1 &#xb7; min-1, volume: 2120 mm3, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009) which is part of the ventral network. These 4 regions are involved in psychomotor speed performance, which improved as the movement time reduced by (mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD) 20&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;37&#xa0;ms (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005). Executive function and memory did not change. Longer-term soy nut consumption may improve cerebrovascular function of older adults, because regional CBF increased. Effects may underlie observed improvements in psychomotor speed.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03627637.
