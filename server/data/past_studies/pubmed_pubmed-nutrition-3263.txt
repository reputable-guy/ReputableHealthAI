Study Title: Evaluating the Impact of Probiotic Therapy on the Endocannabinoid System, Pain, Sleep and Fatigue: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial in Dancers.

Study Summary:
Emerging research links the endocannabinoid system to gut microbiota, influencing nociception, mood, and immunity, yet the molecular interactions remain unclear. This study focused on the effects of probiotics on ECS markers-cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)-in dancers, a group selected due to their high exposure to physical and psychological stress. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05567653), 15 dancers were assigned to receive either a 12-week regimen ofRosell-52 andRosell-17 or a placebo (PLA:= 10, PRO:= 5). There were no significant changes in CB2 (probiotic: 0.55 to 0.29 ng/mL; placebo: 0.86 to 0.72 ng/mL) or FAAH levels (probiotic: 5.93 to 6.02 ng/mL; placebo: 6.46 to 6.94 ng/mL;> 0.05). A trend toward improved sleep quality was observed in the probiotic group, while the placebo group showed a decline (PRO: from 1.4 to 1.0; PLA: from 0.8 to 1.2;= 0.07841). No other differences were noted in assessed outcomes (pain and fatigue). Probiotic supplementation showed no significant impact on CB2 or FAAH levels, pain, or fatigue but suggested potential benefits for sleep quality, suggesting an area for further research.
