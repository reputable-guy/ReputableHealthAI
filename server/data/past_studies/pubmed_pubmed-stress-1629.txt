Study Title: Can a six-week Swedish massage reduce mood disorders and enhance the quality of life in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis? A randomized control clinical trial.

Study Summary:
There is a limited amount of research specifically focusing on the effects of Swedish massage on mood disorders and the quality of life (QOL) among individuals with MS, emphasizing the need for further investigation. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of a 6-week Swedish massage on the quality of life, stress, anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, spasticity, and sleep quality in MS patients. This randomized controlled trial involved 70 MS patients who were divided into two groups. The massage group underwent two 50-minute sessions of whole-body Swedish massage per week for six weeks, while the usual treatment group maintained their regular medical care routine. Outcomes were Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-P), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). These measurements were taken before and after the massage intervention. The massage group demonstrated significant improvements in QOL and its components compared to the usual treatment group (Hedge's g = 0.53 for QOL, ranging from 0.31 to 0.58 for QOL components; p < 0.001). Participants in the massage group also reported significantly lower levels of stress (Hedge's g = 0. 80), anxiety (Hedge's g = 0.47), and depression (Hedge's g = 0.70) than those in the usual treatment group (p < 0.001). Additionally, the massage group had lower levels of pain, fatigue, and spasticity, and better sleep quality compared to the usual treatment group (p < 0.05). Swedish massage can be considered a valuable complementary and alternative treatment alongside conventional medicine for individuals with MS.
