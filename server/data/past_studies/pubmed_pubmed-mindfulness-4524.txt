Study Title: Healthcare Workers' Well-Being: A Systematic Review of Positive Psychology Interventions.

Study Summary:
Given persistent occupational stressors and multiple challenges in the delivery of healthcare, there is an increased focus on the well-being of healthcare workers. Responding to these challenges will require a multipronged approach, focusing on system level, organization, and individual actions. Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) represent a promising area for individual action. This systematic review indicates that PPI, delivered via many methods, holds promise for improving the well-being of healthcare workers, although there is a clear need for additional randomized controlled trials utilizing defined and standardized outcome measures. In this review, the most commonly evaluated PPIs were mindfulness-based or gratitude-based interventions. These were delivered via different methods, with many administered in the workplace and commonly in the form of courses ranging from two days to eight weeks. Researchers documented measurable improvements in multiple studied outcomes, noting reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, burnout, and stress. Some interventions increased well-being, job and life satisfaction, self-compassion, relaxation, and resilience. Most studies emphasized that these are simple, accessible, low-cost interventions. Limitations included some nonrandomized or quasi-experimental designs, alongside generally small sample sizes and varying methods of intervention delivery. Another concern is the lack of standardized outcome assessments and long-term follow-up data. As almost all studies included were performed before the pandemic, further research will be required post-pandemic. Overall, however, PPI shows promise as one arm of a multipronged approach to improving the well-being of healthcare workers.
