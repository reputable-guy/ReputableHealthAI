Study Title: Using Meditation to Reduce Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Nursing Students.

Study Summary:
Nursing students experience higher rates of mental health issues than other college students. This study examined the effect of a mindfulness meditation intervention on nursing students' levels of self-reported depression, stress, and anxiety. This randomized, experimental study implemented an online mindfulness meditation intervention for an experimental group of nursing students and provided nursing news modules for a control group of nursing students. Participants in experimental and control groups completed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale online before and after completing 4 weeks of audio modules. Results showed a statistically significant decrease in reported scores for depression, stress, and anxiety in the experimental group. This study demonstrated the potential benefits of implementing an online mindfulness meditation intervention to support and improve mental health for nursing students..
