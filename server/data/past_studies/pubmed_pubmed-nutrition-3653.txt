Study Title: Diet and Nutrition: Which Role for Mental Health?

Study Summary:
There is a correlation between food and mental health, as well as the increased prevalence of chronic diseases in psychiatric patients. Factors that can contribute to this include psychopharmacological treatment, unhealthy lifestyles, inadequate self-care, poor social and emotional integration, difficulty seeking help from doctors and low compliance with treatments. Studies have also shown that individual nutrients and dietary habits can impact psychophysical well-being. The survey was conducted from February to March 2023 using Google Forms. It involved a questionnaire that was administered to a sample of 72 employees from the Departments of Mental Health in the Puglia Region. The questionnaire consisted of ten statements evaluating the importance of promoting adequate lifestyles and nutritional education in patients with psychiatric disorders through the role of the dietician. The survey shows that most operators recognize the importance of dietitians in managing the nutritional needs of psychiatric patients, but there is some disagreement regarding the extent of their competence and role. For example, some operators do not consider dietitians as the only qualified and competent professionals to apply dietary styles, and not all of them agree on the importance of including dietitians in mental health care teams. The survey also suggests that including dietitians in mental health care teams could help manage the metabolic changes induced by psychopharmacological treatment and reduce healthcare costs. Our data highlight the importance of nutrition in mental health and the need for greater recognition of the role of dietitians in treating psychiatric patients. Considering nutrition as a fundamental aspect of mental health is crucial to promoting overall wellness and preventing chronic conditions.
