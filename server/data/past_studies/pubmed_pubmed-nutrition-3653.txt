Study Title: Effects of engaging fathers and bundling parenting and nutrition interventions on early child development and maternal and paternal parenting in Mara, Tanzania: a factorial cluster-randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Multicomponent interventions are needed to address the various co-occurring risks that compromise early child nutrition and development. We compared the independent and combined effects of engaging fathers and bundling parenting components into a nutrition intervention on early child development (ECD) and parenting outcomes. We conducted a 2&#xd7;2 factorial cluster-randomized controlled trial across 80 villages in Mara Region, Tanzania, also known as EFFECTS (Engaging Fathers for Effective Child Nutrition and Development in Tanzania; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03759821). Households with children under 18&#x2009;months of age residing with their mother and father were enrolled. Villages were randomly assigned to one of five groups: a nutrition intervention for mothers, a nutrition intervention for couples, a bundled nutrition and parenting intervention for mothers, a bundled intervention for couples, and a standard-of-care control. Interventions were delivered by trained community health workers through peer groups and home visits over 12&#x2009;months. Mothers, fathers, and children were assessed at baseline, midline, and endline or postintervention. We used a difference-in-difference approach with intention-to-treat analysis to estimate intervention effects on ECD (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition) and maternal and paternal parenting and psychosocial well-being. Between October 29, 2018, and May 24, 2019, 960 households were enrolled (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;192 per arm). Compared to nutrition interventions, bundled interventions improved children's cognitive (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.18 [95% CI: 0.01, 0.36]) and receptive language development (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.23 [0.04, 0.41]). There were no differences between interventions for other ECD domains. Compared to nutrition interventions, bundled interventions achieved additional benefits on maternal stimulation (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.21 [0.04, 0.38]) and availability of home learning materials (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.25 [0.07-0.43]) and reduced paternal parenting distress (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.34 [-0.55, -0.12]). Compared to interventions with mothers only, interventions that engaged fathers improved paternal stimulation (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.45 [0.27, 0.63]). Jointly bundling parenting components into nutrition interventions while also engaging both mothers and fathers is most effective for improving maternal and paternal parenting and ECD outcomes.
