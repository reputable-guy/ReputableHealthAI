Study Title: Sleep duration and association with cardiometabolic health in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes: Results from the BCQR-T1D study.

Study Summary:
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, and insufficient sleep is prevalent. Emerging evidence suggests a link between sleep and cardiometabolic health, but this has not been examined across the lifespan in individuals with T1D. We aimed to examine associations between sleep and cardiometabolic health in adolescents and adults with T1D in a secondary analysis of data from a 4-week double-blind, random-order, placebo-controlled crossover trial of bromocriptine quick release (BCQR) therapy with a 4-week washout in between conditions. Forty-two adults (19-60&#x2009;years) and 42 adolescents (12-18&#x2009;years) with T1D >9&#x2009;months completed 1&#x2009;week of home monitoring with wrist-worn actigraphy to estimate sleep duration and continuous glucose monitoring, anthropometrics, arterial stiffness, magnetic resonance imaging (adolescents only), and fasting laboratory testing at each treatment phase. Sixty-two per cent of adolescents and 74% of adults obtained <7&#x2009;h of sleep per night at baseline. After adjustment for age, sex and diabetes duration, baseline sleep <7&#x2009;h per night was associated with a higher body mass index, a higher waist circumference, a higher systolic blood pressure, worse arterial stiffness and a lower estimated insulin sensitivity (all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). When examined by age group, associations between sleep duration and cardiometabolic health outcomes remained significant, predominantly for adolescents. In adolescents only, wake time was significantly later (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.027) and time in bed was significantly longer with BCQR versus placebo (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.049). Objectively measured sleep <7&#x2009;h per night was prevalent in adolescents and adults with T1D and associated with poorer cardiometabolic health markers. Small changes in sleep were seen following BCQR treatment in adolescents only. Sleep may be an important and novel target for improving cardiometabolic health in individuals with T1D.
