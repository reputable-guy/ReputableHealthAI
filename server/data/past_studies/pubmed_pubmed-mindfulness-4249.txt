Study Title: Daily micropractice can augment single-session interventions: A randomized controlled trial of self-compassionate touch and examining their associations with habit formation in US college students.

Study Summary:
In this pre-registered study, we evaluated the effects of a single-session, self-guided intervention, leveraging daily micropractice (&#x2264;20&#xa0;seconds/day practice) of self-compassionate touch to enhance self-compassion. We randomly assigned undergraduates (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;135) to one of two conditions: a single-session intervention in which they were taught self-compassionate touch or a finger-tapping active control. Then, we instructed them to practice for 20&#xa0;seconds/day for one month. At baseline (T1) and one-month follow-up (T2), participants completed assessments of self-compassion, growth mindset, positive affect, stress, psychopathology, habit formation, and more. In confirmatory, intention-to-treat analyses (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;135), we found no significant effects on these outcomes. However, in confirmatory, per-protocol analyses (comparing the subsets from each condition who practiced>28 times, N&#xa0;=&#xa0;45), self-compassionate touch, relative to active control, predicted T1-to-T2 increases in self-compassion (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.71, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.025), and reductions in stress (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.62, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.047) and psychopathology (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.61, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.046). In exploratory intention-to-treat analyses (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;135), we found the same pattern of effects as in the per-protocol analyses among those who practiced self-compassionate touch more frequently relative to active control. We discuss factors associated with habit formation of daily practice. Daily micropractices have the potential for augmenting single-session interventions and for offering help when more time-intensive approaches may be less accessible.
