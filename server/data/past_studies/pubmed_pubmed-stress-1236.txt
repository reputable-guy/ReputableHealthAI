Study Title: Implementation of Virtual, Livestream Yoga Classes for Veterans at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Program Evaluation.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic and shut down of in-person complementary and integrative (CIH) wellness services at the San Francisco Veterans' Affairs Healthcare System (SFVAHCS) required implementation of virtual program delivery. In May 2020, VA in-person group yoga classes pivoted to virtual classes for existing attendees. In October 2020, we partnered with SFVAHCS Integrative Health and the VA Office of Rural Health to formalize the TeleYoga Program to expand yoga access to Veterans in SFVAHCS' geographically dispersed area. This pilot study evaluated Veterans' experiences and self-reported health outcomes after participating in at-home tele-yoga groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. The RE-AIM framework guided program delivery evaluation. Reach was assessed with medical record data. Adoption was assessed by the number of new facilities providing referrals to tele-yoga. Implementation, satisfaction, and patient-reported outcomes, were evaluated through structured interviews with Likert scale and open-ended responses. We offered 4-6 weekly livestreamed classes between October 2020-September 2021. The program reached 70 Veterans, including 40 new participants, with 1208 total unique encounters. Referrals increased from 2 to 6 SFVAHCS facilities. Fourteen participants completed structured interviews. Over half rated highly the convenience and overall experience of tele-yoga classes and reported improvement with pain, stress management, exercise, and flexibility. Open-ended responses indicated opportunities for social connection, maintaining mental health, cultivating resilience, improving function, and managing pain. Suggestions for improvement focused on technological aspects, including audiovisual quality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we successfully transitioned and expanded virtual group yoga delivery to Veterans from all geographic locations within SFVAHCS. We attribute this success to existing infrastructure for telehealth and CIH services and a virtual program orientation for new participants. The results of this pilot study suggest in-person group yoga may be successfully implemented virtually, serving as a viable modality that contributes to holistic wellbeing for Veterans.
