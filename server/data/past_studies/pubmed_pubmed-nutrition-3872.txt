Study Title: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study examining an Oxygen Nanobubble Beverage for 16.1-km Time Trial and Repeated Sprint Cycling Performance.

Study Summary:
There is growing interest of ergogenic aids that deliver supplemental oxygen during exercise and recovery, however, breathing supplemental oxygenspecialist facemasks is often not feasible. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of an oxygen-nanobubble beverage during submaximal and repeated sprint cycling. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 10 male cyclists (peak aerobic capacity, 56.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.1&#x2009;mL&#xb7;kg&#xb7;min; maximal aerobic power, 385&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;25&#x2009;W) completed submaximal or maximal exercise after consuming an oxygen-nanobubble (O) or placebo (PLA) beverage. Submaximal trials comprised 30-min of steady-state cycling at 60% peak aerobic capacity and 16.1-km time-trial (TT). Maximal trials involved 4&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;30&#x2009;s Wingate tests interspersed by 4-min recovery. Time-to-completion during the 16.1-km TT was 2.4% faster after Ocompared with PLA (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7-4.0%,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41). Average power for the 16.1-km TT was 4.1% higher for Ovs. PLA (&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.1-7.3%,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28). Average peak power during the repeated Wingate tests increased by 7.1% for Ocompared with PLA (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58). An oxygen-nanobubble beverage improves performance during submaximal and repeated sprint cycling, therefore may provide a practical and effective ergogenic aid for competitive cyclists.
