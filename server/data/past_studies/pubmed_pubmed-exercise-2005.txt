Study Title: Investigation of the effect of nitrate and L-arginine intake on aerobic, anaerobic performance, balance, agility, and recovery in elite taekwondo athletes.

Study Summary:
Taekwondo is a complex martial art that requires speed, balance, agility, and endurance. This study aims to examine the effects of nitrate and L-arginine supplementation on acute aerobic and anaerobic performance, balance, agility, and recovery in elite taekwondo athletes. This study was conducted as a double-blind, randomized, crossover study with the participation of 15 experienced taekwondo athletes aged 19.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.96&#x2009;years and 8.93&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.27&#x2009;years of training experience. Participants visited the laboratory a total of nine times, including a practice session and anthropometric measurements. These visits consisted of eight experimental sessions conducted at 72-hour intervals. The experimental sessions were conducted with nitrate, L-arginine, and a combination of both supplements (NIT*L-ARG) and placebo. Nitrate supplementation was provided by homogenizing fresh spinach (837.40&#x2009;mg/kg), while L-ARG was given as a single dose of 6&#x2009;g in powder form three hours before exercise. NIT*L-ARG supplementation significantly improved the anaerobic performance of athletes in Wingate peak power and peak power (w/kg) compared to placebo and in mean power compared to NIT, L-ARG, and PLA. In addition, NIT*L-ARG supplementation significantly improved blood lactate levels and agility performance immediately after Wingate and Shuttle run tests. The combined intake of NIT*L-ARG was found to be effective in improving aerobic, anaerobic, and agility performances as well as fatigue levels of athletes. It was determined that taking NIT and L-ARG supplements alone contributed to the improvement of improving athletes' performance in Wingate mean power values and subsequent fatigue level compared to PLA.
