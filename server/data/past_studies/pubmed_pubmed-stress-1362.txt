Study Title: The effects of virtual reality and stress ball distraction on procedure-related emotional appearance, pain, fear, and anxiety during phlebotomy in children: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Virtual reality (VR) and stress balls can be used during phlebotomy in school-age children. This randomized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effect of distraction methods using VR and stress balls on the emotional behavior, pain, fear, and anxiety associated with phlebotomy in children aged 7-12. A parallel trial with a three-arm design approach was adopted for this randomized controlled trial, guided by the CONSORT checklist. The study sample (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;150) was divided into VR, stress ball, and control group using stratified randomization. The mean scores obtained from the Children's Emotional Manifestation Scale, Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, Child Anxiety Scale-State, and Child Fear Scale were compared between the groups. Linear regression analysis and correlation analysis were performed. Significant differences were found in phlebotomy-related pain, fear, and anxiety. While there was no difference in emotional behavior before the phlebotomy, a significant difference was found after the phlebotomy. Being in the virtual reality group explained 30.8&#xa0;% of the difference between the before and after phlebotomy-related-emotional behavior scores. A strong, positive, and significant relationship was found between emotional behavior scores after phlebotomy and phlebotomy-related fear, pain, and anxiety scores (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.01). Virtual reality and stress ball distraction were found to be effective in reducing pain, fear, and anxiety during phlebotomy. Virtual reality distraction is effective in reducing negative emotional behaviors. The VR distraction can be used in the pediatric population in pain, fear, anxiety, and emotional behavior management during phlebotomy. gov Identifier: NCT05818761.
