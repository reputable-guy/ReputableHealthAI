Study Title: Effects of personalized music listening on post-stroke cognitive impairment: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Previous studies have suggested that music listening has the potential to positively affect cognitive functions and mood in individuals with post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI), with a preference for self-selected music likely to yield better outcomes. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to suggest the use of music listening in routine rehabilitation care to treat PSCI. This randomized control trial (RCT) aims to investigate the effects of personalized music listening on mood improvement, activities of daily living (ADLs), and cognitive functions in individuals with PSCI. A total of 34 patients with PSCI were randomly assigned to either the music group or the control group. Patients in the music group underwent a three-month personalized music-listening intervention. The intervention involved listening to a personalized playlist tailored to each individual's cultural, ethnic, and social background, life experiences, and personal music preferences. In contrast, the control group patients listened to white noise as a placebo. Cognitive function, neurological function, mood, and ADLs were assessed. After three months of treatment, the music group showed significantly higher Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores compared to the control group (p=0.027), particularly in the domains of delayed recall (p=0.019) and orientation (p=0.023). Moreover, the music group demonstrated significantly better scores in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (p=0.008), Barthel Index (BI) (p=0.019), and Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) (p=0.008) compared to the control group. No effects were found on mood as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Personalized music listening promotes the recovery of cognitive and neurological functions, improves ADLs, and reduces caregiver burden in patients with PSCI.
