Study Title: Effects of Thermal Insulation on Recovery and Comfort of Patients Undergoing Holmium Laser Lithotripsy.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND Patients with urolithiasis often undergo transurethral ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy, a procedure that can be affected by perioperative thermal management. This study examines the impact of compound thermal insulation management on patient recovery and comfort during transurethral ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, 551 patients who underwent transurethral ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy from April 2019 to December 2022 were randomly assigned to either an observation group (n=276) or control group (n=275). Both groups received routine surgical care, with the observation group additionally receiving compound thermal insulation management. We recorded and compared perioperative body temperature changes, anesthetic resuscitation indicators (bispectral index recovery time, extubation time, fully awake time, Postanesthesia Care Unit retention time), comfort level (General Comfort Questionnaire), and quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile). We also compared the incidence of complications. RESULTS There was no significant difference in body temperature between groups at the start surgery. However, the observation group showed significantly higher temperatures during and at the end of surgery. Anesthetic resuscitation indicators were significantly better in the observation group. Both groups showed improved comfort and quality of life after surgery, with more significant improvements in the observation group. The observation group also had a lower incidence of complications, such as hypothermia and rigor. CONCLUSIONS Compound thermal insulation management during transurethral ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy improved perioperative temperature maintenance, accelerated postoperative recovery, reduced complication rates, and enhanced patient comfort and quality of life.
