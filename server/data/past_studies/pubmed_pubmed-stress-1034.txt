Study Title: A Qualitative Analysis of Students' Perceptions and Experiences of Stressors and Well-Being in Dentistry.

Study Summary:
Well-being is increasingly regarded as an integral component of a graduating dentist's professional responsibility, yet studies demonstrate significant levels of stress and poor mental health in the dental student population. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore final-year dental students' perceptions of stressors in dentistry and their experiences of managing their individual well-being and supporting the well-being of their colleagues and patients. A literature search was performed to guide the development of an interview framework which included questions centred around three higher domains based on self, peers and patients. Participants were randomly sampled and the interviews audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. An inductive-deductive approach was adopted for thematic analysis of the results. Fourteen interviews were conducted, revealing four themes and 15 subthemes. Students were acutely aware of poor well-being symptoms amongst themselves and their peers. Treating dental patients with mental illness was common but some students expressed uncertainties in managing these patients. The key stressors were assessments and clinical stress. Students frequently sought support from peers and half had received professional help. Barriers to approaching faculty staff were identified. The role of stigma in preventing students from openly sharing their well-being experiences was discussed. A range of curricular and clinical stressors, and potential sources of support to manage these stressors, have been explored from the perspectives of final-year dental students. From these experiences, action points have been proposed to address knowledge gaps and enhance faculty-level wellness support for dental students.
