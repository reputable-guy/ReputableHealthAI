Study Title: The efficacy and safety of ciprofol and propofol in patients undergoing colonoscopy: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Propofol is a commonly utilized anesthetic for painless colonoscopy, but its usage is occasionally limited due to its potential side effects, including cardiopulmonary suppression and injection pain. To address this limitation, the novel compound ciprofol has been proposed as a possible alternative for propofol. This study sought to determine whether there are any differences in the safety and efficacy of propofol and ciprofol for painless colonoscopy. Randomized clinical trial. Single-centre, class A tertiary hospital, November 2021 to November 2022. Adult, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I to II and body mass index of 18 to 30&#xa0;kg&#xa0;mpatients scheduled to undergo colonoscopy. Consecutive patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive sedation for colonoscopy with ciprofol (group C) or propofol (group P). The primary outcome was the success rate of colonoscopy. The secondary outcomes were onset time of sedation, operation time, recovery time and discharge time, patients and endoscopists satisfaction, side effects (e.g. injection pain, myoclonus, drowsiness, dizziness, procedure recall, nausea and vomiting) and incidence rate of cardiopulmonary adverse events. No significant difference was found in the success rate of colonoscopy between the two groups (ciprofol 96.3% vs. propofol 97.6%; mean difference&#xa0;-&#xa0;1.2%, 95% CI: -6.5% to 4.0%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.650). However, group C showed prolonged sedation (63.4 vs. 54.8&#xa0;s, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and fully alert times (9 vs 8&#xa0;min, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013), as well as reduced incidences of injection pain (0 vs. 40.2%, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), respiratory depression (2.4% vs. 13.4%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.021) and hypotension (65.9% vs. 80.5%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034). Patients satisfaction was also higher in Group C (10 vs 9, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Ciprofol can be used independently for colonoscopy. When comparing the sedation efficacy of ciprofol and propofol, a 0.4&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kgdose of ciprofol proved to be equal to a 2.0&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kgdose of propofol, with fewer side effects and greater patient satisfaction during the procedure.
