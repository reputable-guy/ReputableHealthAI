Study Title: Clinical Analysis of Different Anesthesia and Analgesia Methods for Patients Undergoing Uniportal Video-assisted Lung Surgery.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to compare 3 intraoperative modalities to determine the best and most convenient one for pain control for uniportal lung surgery. This study compared general anesthesia with serratus plane block, general anesthesia with epidural, and general anesthesia alone to examine postoperative pain scores in patients. Eighty patients were enrolled and statistically analyzed. Three interventions were studied: general anesthesia with serratus plane block (group S), general anesthesia with thoracic epidural (group E), and general anesthesia only (group G). Outcome measures compared among the 3 groups included demographic characteristics; surgical types; anesthesia and operative time; postoperative pain scores; vital signs; morphine consumption at 0, 2, and 6 hours and day 1 and day 2 after surgery; incidence of opioid-related adverse events and chronic pain; hospital length of stay (LOS); and overall expenses. The numerical rating scale was used to assess the degree of pain on the first and second postoperative days. Postoperative morphine consumption, incidence of opioid-related side effects, hospital LOS, and overall hospital expenses were documented, as well as incidence of chronic postoperative pain. There was no difference in the incidence of opioid-related adverse events and chronic pain, hospital LOS, and overall expenses among the 3 groups. After investigating factors that may influence hospital LOS and overall expenses, the multivariable analysis indicated that only longer operative time was associated with longer hospital stay and more hospital expenses. This prospective study found that general anesthesia alone offers an easy and efficient approach resulting in similar postoperative pain scores and morphine consumption compared with nerve block and epidural. Longer operative time was associated with longer hospital stay and more hospital expenses. gov identifier: NCT03839160. (Clin Ther. 2024;XX:XXX-XXX) &#xa9; 2024 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.
