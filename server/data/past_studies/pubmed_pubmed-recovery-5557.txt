Study Title: Ultrasound-guided transversalis fascia plane block or transversus abdominis plane block for recovery after caesarean section: A randomised clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Caesarean section is a widely performed surgical procedure that often results in moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. If left untreated, this pain can lead to short-term and long-term consequences. Transversalis fascia plane (TFP) block and transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block are among the regional anaesthesia techniques employed for managing pain after a caesarean section. We aimed to compare the impact of these two blocks on the quality of recovery in patients undergoing elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. A single-centre, double-blind, randomised trial. Operating room, postanaesthesia recovery unit, and ward in a tertiary hospital. Ninety-three patients (ASA 2 to 3) were recruited. After exclusion, 79 patients were included in the final analysis: 40 in the TFP block group and 39 in the TAP block group. After surgery, participants received either TFP block (20&#x200a;ml 0.25% bupivacaine for each side) or TAP block (20&#x200a;ml 0.25% bupivacaine for each side). The primary outcome was the difference in obstetric quality of recovery 11-Turkish (ObsQoR-11T) scores between groups. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, opioid consumption and incidence of opioid-related complications. The mean ObsQoR-11T score was higher in the TFP block group compared with the TAP block group (97.13&#x200a;&#xb1;&#x200a;6.67 points vs. 87.10&#x200a;&#xb1;&#x200a;9.84 points, respectively; P &#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001). The pain scores in the TFP block group were slightly lower between postoperative 4 and 24&#x200a;h. The mean total morphine consumption was 15.08&#x200a;&#xb1;&#x200a;2.21&#x200a;mg in the TFP block group and 22.21&#x200a;&#xb1;&#x200a;3.04&#x200a;mg in the TAP block group ( P &#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001). More patients required rescue analgesia between 4 and 8&#x200a;h in the TAP block group [2.00 (5.00%) vs. 9.00 (23.08%), P &#x200a;=&#x200a;0.02]. No significant differences were observed between groups in terms of opioid-related side effects. TFP block used for analgesic purposes yielded a better quality recovery period than TAP block and also reduced opioid consumption. Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05999981). http://links.lww.com/EJA/B6 .
