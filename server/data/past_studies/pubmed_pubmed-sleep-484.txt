Study Title: Effect of case management based on Omaha system on clinical symptoms and quality of life of coronary heart disease patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of case management (CM) based on the Omaha system on clinical symptoms and quality of life (QOL) of coronary heart disease patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with coronary heart disease after their first PCI in the People's Hospital of Longhua in Shenzhen were randomly divided into a control group (received CM based on the Omaha system) and an observation group (received routine nursing) using a random number table. Nursing problems and the knowledge-behavior-status (KBS) score of patients were evaluated on the day after surgery, on the day before discharge, at 5 weeks after discharge, and at 12 weeks after discharge. The QOL of patients was evaluated using the coronary intervention coronary revascularization outcome questionnaire (CROQ-PTCA-Post, Chinese version) score on the day after surgery and at 12 weeks after discharge. A total of 104 patients completed the study (51 in the control group, 53 in the observation group). There were no significant differences in baseline data between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;gr.05). The main nursing problems were circulation, mental health, and pain in both groups on the day after surgery, whereas they were circulation, sleep and rest, and mental health after nursing. There were no significant differences in the KBS scores of the co-existing nursing problems on the day after surgery (P&#x2005;Th.05). The KBS scores of the co-existing nursing problems were significantly increased between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.01) on the day before discharge and at 5 weeks and 12 weeks after discharge. The KBS scores of the most co-existing nursing problems in the observation group were significantly higher at 12 weeks after discharge than at the day before discharge and at 5 weeks after discharge. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the CROQ-PTCA-Post scores on the first day after surgery between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;gr.05). These scores were significantly increased between the 2 groups at 12 weeks after discharge (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.01). CM based on the Omaha system for patients after PCI can effectively improve the KBS scores and QOL of PCI patients with postoperative nursing problems, making this approach worthy of clinical promotion.
