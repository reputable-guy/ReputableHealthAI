Study Title: The Comparison of Individual and Group Hybrid Telerehabilitation Methods in Women with Urinary Incontinence.

Study Summary:
The aim is to compare the effects of the progressive training program (PTP), a new protocol, with two different hybrid telerehabilitation methods, on the parameters related to urinary incontinence in women with urinary incontinence. A total of 50 participants with stress or mixed urinary incontinence participated in this two-arm, parallel-group, randomized, non-inferiority trial. Individual hybrid training (IHT) or group hybrid training (GHT) was given to women for 8&#xa0;weeks. The Power, Endurance, Repetitions, Fast contractions, and Every Contraction Timed (PERFECT) scheme and surface electromyography were used to assess pelvic floor muscle function, whereas quality of life, exercise adherence, and symptoms were assessed by questionnaires and a 3-day bladder diary. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Linear mixed model analysis with the factors "time" and "group" was used to determine the effects of IHT and GHT. The primary outcome was changes in pelvic floor muscle function as evaluated using the PERFECT scheme and surface electromyography at the 4th and 8th weeks relative to baseline. No statistical difference was found between the groups except for "power" of the PERFECT scheme and "nocturnal urination frequency" (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The GHT showed significant improvement in P and nocturnal urination frequency at the end of the 8th week (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). From baseline to week 8, the effect size for the P value was found to be small (Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.33). Eight&#xa0;weeks of PTP did not lead to different results in incontinence-related parameters in either of the training methods. It may be better to conduct GHT in terms of implementing PTP in incontinence and training programs in terms of time, staff workload, and applicability.
