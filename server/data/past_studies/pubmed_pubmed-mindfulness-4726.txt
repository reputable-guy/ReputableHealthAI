Study Title: Aerobic exercise, mindfulness meditation, and stress-reduction in high-stress, college-based young adults: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
This pilot study assessed the feasibility and combined effect of aerobic exercise (AE) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with MM alone and a control (CON) condition, on stress, anxiety, and depression in high-stress college-based young adults. Thirty-two participants (84.4% F, 20.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.7&#x2009;years, 23.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.0&#x2009;kg/m) were randomized to a four-week, AE&#x2009;+&#x2009;MM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), MM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;10), or control intervention (&#x2009;=&#x2009;6). ANOVA revealed non-significant, but noteworthy group x time interactions (perceived stress:&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09; anxiety/depression:&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07). Both AE&#x2009;+&#x2009;MM and MM seem to be feasible strategies to reduce levels of stress, anxiety and depression in college-based young adults.
