Study Title: Research on the application of CBL combined with BOPPPS teaching mode in oral and maxillofacial surgery teaching: a randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
To discuss the application value of Case-based Learning (CBL) combined with Bridge-In, Objective, Pre-assessment, Participatory Learning, Post-assessment, and Summary (BOPPPS) model into master students' program of oral and maxillofacial surgery. 38 master's students in oral and maxillofacial surgery at Y2 and Y3 from January 2022 to December 2022 are selected as the research objects. They are randomly assigned into two learning groups, namely the traditional LBL (Learn-based Learning) (19 participants) and CBL combined with BOPPPS mode (19 participants). Their theoretical knowledge was assessed after training and the modified Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) scale was used to score their clinical thinking. At the same time, the Personal Teaching Efficiency and the Teachers' Sense of Teaching Efficiency (TSTE) were evaluated, and students' satisfaction with teaching outcomes was investigated. The basic theoretical knowledge, clinical case analysis and total scores of the experimental group were better than those of the control group, with statistically significant difference (P&#x2009;<0.05). Based on the evaluation of clinical speculative thinking by the modified Mini-CEX, it is found that except for the medical history writing level without statistically significant difference (P&#x2009;>0.05), the other four items and total scores in the experimental group were better than those in the control group, with statistically significant difference (P&#x2009;<0.05).The Personal Teaching Efficiency, TSTE and total scores were higher than those before adopting CBL combined with BOPPPS teaching mode, with statistically significant difference (P&#x2009;<0.05).The sampled master's students in experimental group believed that the new teaching method could improve students' ability to clinical speculative thinking, with statistically significant difference in all aspects (P&#x2009;<0.05).More participants in the experimental group suggested that the new teaching mode has increased learning pressure, but without statistically significant difference (P&#x2009;>0.05). CBL combined with BOPPPS teaching method can improve students' clinical critical thinking ability and help them adapt to the clinical rhythm. It is an effective measure to ensure teaching quality and is worthy of promotion. It is worthwhile to promote the application of CBL combined with BOPPPS mode into master's course of oral and maxillofacial surgery, which not only improve the basic theoretical knowledge and speculative thinking ability of master's students, but also improve the teaching efficiency.
