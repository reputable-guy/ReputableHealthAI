Study Title: Assessing the Impact of Non-Exhaust Emissions on the Asthmatic Airway (IONA) Protocol for a Randomised Three-Exposure Crossover Study.

Study Summary:
People living with asthma are disproportionately affected by air pollution, with increased symptoms, medication usage, hospital admissions, and the risk of death. To date, there has been a focus on exhaust emissions, but traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) can also arise from the mechanical abrasion of tyres, brakes, and road surfaces. We therefore created a study with the aim of investigating the acute impacts of non-exhaust emissions (NEEs) on the lung function and airway immune status of asthmatic adults. A randomised three-condition crossover panel design will expose adults with asthma using a 2.5 h intermittent cycling protocol in a random order at three locations in London, selected to provide the greatest contrast in the NEE components within TRAP. Lung function will be monitored using oscillometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and spirometry (the primary outcome is the forced expiratory volume in one second). Biomarkers of inflammation and airborne metal exposure will be measured in the upper airway using nasal lavage. Symptom responses will be monitored using questionnaires. Sources of exhaust and non-exhaust concentrations will be established using source apportionment via the positive matrix factorisation of high-time resolution chemical measures conducted at the exposure sites. Collectively, this study will provide us with valuable information on the health effects of NEE components within ambient PMand PM, whilst establishing a biological mechanism to help contextualise current epidemiological observations.
