Study Title: Neuromuscular adaptations to perturbation-based balance training using treadmill belt accelerations do not transfer to an obstacle trip in older people: A cross-over randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study examined (i) adaptations in muscle activity following perturbation-based balance training (PBT) using treadmill belt-accelerations or PBT using walkway trips and (ii) whether adaptations during treadmill PBT transfer to a walkway trip. Thirty-eight older people (65+ years) undertook two PBT sessions, including 11 treadmill belt-accelerations and 11 walkway trips. Surface electromyography (EMG) was measured bilaterally on the rectus femoris (RF), tibialis anterior (TA), semitendinosus (ST) and gastrocnemius medial head (GM) during the first (T1) and eleventh (T11) perturbations. Adaptations (within-subjects - 1st vs 11th perturbations for treadmill and walkway PBT) and their transfer (between-subjects - 1st walkway trip after treadmill PBT vs 1st walkway trip with no prior training) effects were examined for the EMG parameters. Treadmill PBT reduced post-perturbation peak muscle activation magnitude (left RF, TA, ST, right RF, ST, GM), onset latency (right TA), time to peak (right RF) and co-contraction index (knee muscles) (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Walkway PBT reduced post-trip onset latencies (right TA, ST), peak magnitude (left ST, right GM), time to peak (right RF, ST) and pre-perturbation muscle activity (right TA) (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Those who undertook treadmill PBT were not different to those without prior training during the first walkway trip (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). Both treadmill and walkway PBT induced earlier initiation and peak activation of right limb muscles responsible for the first recovery step. Treadmill PBT also reduced co-contraction of the knee muscles. Adaptations in muscle activity following treadmill PBT did not transfer to a walkway trip.
