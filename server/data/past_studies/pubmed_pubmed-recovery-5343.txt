Study Title: Assessing the clinical advantage of opioid-reduced anesthesia in thoracoscopic sympathectomy: a prospective randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Opioid-reduced multimodal analgesia has been used clinically for many years to decrease the perioperative complications associated with opioid drugs. We aimed to assess the clinical effects of opioid-reduced anesthesia during thoracoscopic sympathectomy. Surgical patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;151) with palmar hyperhidrosis were randomly divided into control (Group C, 73 patients) and test (Group T, 78 patients) groups. All patients were administered general anesthesia using a laryngeal mask. In Group C, patients received propofol, fentanyl, and cisatracurium for anesthesia induction, and maintenance was achieved with propofol and remifentanil, along with mechanical ventilation during the operation. In Group T, anesthesia was induced with propofol, dezocine, and dexmedetomidine (DEX) and maintained with propofol, DEX, and an intercostal nerve block, along with spontaneous breathing throughout the operation. Perioperative complications related to opioid use include hypotension, bradycardia, hypertension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, nausea, vomiting, urine retention, itching, and dizziness were observed. To assess the impact of these complications, we recorded and compared vital signs, blood gas indices, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, adverse events, and patient satisfaction between the two groups. Perioperative complications related to opioid use were similar between groups. There were no significant differences in the type of perioperative sedation, analgesia index, respiratory and circulatory indicators, blood gas analysis, postoperative VAS scores, adverse reactions, propofol dosage, postoperative recovery time, and patient satisfaction. In minimally invasive surgeries such as thoracoscopic sympathectomy, opioid-reduced anesthesia was found to be safe and effective; however, this method did not demonstrate clinical advantages.
