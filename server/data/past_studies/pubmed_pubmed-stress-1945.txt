Study Title: Discovering the Potential Value of Coenzyme Q10 as an Adjuvant Treatment in Patients With Depression.

Study Summary:
Depressive disorder or mental cold is the most common mental disorder, and depression exists all over the world and in all countries and cultures. The results of several studies have shown that using compounds with antioxidant properties has been fruitful in patients with depression. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a fat-soluble antioxidant and exerts its antioxidant effect by directly neutralizing free radicals or reducing tocopherol and preventing the inhibition of mitochondrial activity because of oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the effects of oral CoQ10 in patients with depression as an adjunctive treatment. Sixty-nine patients with moderate and severe depression were randomly divided into 2 CoQ10 groups (36) and placebo (33). The first group of patients received CoQ10 supplements at a dose of 200 mg daily for 8 weeks along with standard interventions and treatments for depression, and the second group received standard treatments for depression along with a placebo. The change in the score of Montgomery-&#xc5;sberg Depression Rating Scale depression scale was evaluated 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention. Also, at baseline and 8 weeks later at the end of the study, serum levels of total antioxidant capacity, total thiol groups, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and interleukin 6 were assessed. The changes in the depression score at the end of the study showed that, in the group receiving the CoQ10 supplement after 8 weeks, there was a reduction in depression symptoms, which was statistically significant compared with before the start of the study Meanwhile, no significant changes were observed in the patients of the placebo group in terms of symptom reduction. Compared with baseline and the placebo condition, serum levels of nitric oxide and total thiol groups significantly decreased and increased, respectively. Also, no statistically significant changes were observed for interleukin 6, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity. A dose of 200 mg of CoQ10 supplement daily for 8 weeks can reduce depression and fatigue, as well as improve the quality of life of patients with depression. In addition, CoQ10 can significantly improve inflammation and oxidative stress status in patients with depression.
