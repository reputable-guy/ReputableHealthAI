Study Title: Microbiota based personalized nutrition improves hyperglycaemia and hypertension parameters and reduces inflammation: a prospective, open label, controlled, randomized, comparative, proof of concept study.

Study Summary:
Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota composition, abundance and diversity can influence many chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Modulating gut microbiota through targeted nutrition can provide beneficial effects leading to the concept of personalized nutrition for health improvement. In this prospective clinical trial, we evaluated the impact of a microbiome-based targeted personalized diet on hyperglycaemic and hyperlipidaemic individuals. Specifically, BugSpeaks-a microbiome profile test that profiles microbiota using next generation sequencing and provides personalized nutritional recommendation based on the individual microbiota profile was evaluated. A total of 30 participants with type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia were recruited for this study. The microbiome profile of the 15 participants (test arm) was evaluated using whole genome shotgun metagenomics and personalized nutritional recommendations based on their microbiota profile were provided. The remaining 15 participants (control arm) were provided with diabetic nutritional guidance for 3 months. Clinical and anthropometric parameters such as HbA1c, systolic/diastolic pressure, c-reactive protein levels and microbiota composition were measured and compared during the study. The test arm (microbiome-based nutrition) showed a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c level from 8.30 (95% confidence interval (CI), [7.74-8.85]) to 6.67 (95% CI [6.2-7.05]),< 0.001 after 90 days. The test arm also showed a 5% decline in the systolic pressure whereas the control arm showed a 7% increase. Incidentally, a sub-cohort of the test arm of patients with >130 mm Hg systolic pressure showed a statistically significant decrease of systolic pressure by 14%. Interestingly, CRP level was also found to drop by 19.5%. Alpha diversity measures showed a significant increase in Shannon diversity measure (< 0.05), after the microbiome-based personalized dietary intervention. The intervention led to a minimum two-fold (Log2 fold change increase in species likeandwhich might have a beneficial role in the current context and a similar decrease in species likeandwhich have been earlier shown to have some negative effects in the host. Overall, the study indicated a net positive impact of the microbiota based personalized dietary regime on the gut microbiome and correlated clinical parameters.
