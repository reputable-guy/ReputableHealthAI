Study Title: The effects of mindfulness-focused mental performance coaching on a general surgery residency program.

Study Summary:
Burnout is a proven challenge in surgeons and surgical trainees, associated with higher rates of attrition compared to other medical specialties. Here we report the impact of a mental performance coaching program as it relates to surgery trainee wellbeing. A mixed-format mental performance coaching program was implemented at a large academic medical center's general surgery residency over a single academic year. Survey scores related to burnout, self-efficacy, and professional fulfillment were used to analyze the impact of the program as a whole, as well as by large group, small group, and one-on-one format attendance. Residents that attended the small group or one-on-one sessions demonstrated a trend towards improved burnout and professional fulfillment. The PGY3 group attended the most small format sessions and demonstrated a significant decrease in burnout (p&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;0.03). This offers an adaptable intervention for residency programs to improve the wellbeing of their trainees.
