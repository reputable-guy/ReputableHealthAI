Study Title: Effects of kinesio taping combined with upper extremity function training home program on upper limb function and self-efficacy in stroke patients: An experimental study.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of kinesio taping and an upper extremity function home program on the upper extremity function and self-efficacy of stroke patients, and to present therapeutic evidence for home program intervention to improve upper extremity function. First, 53 stroke patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 26 experimental subjects and 27 controls. The experimental group performed kinesio taping on the dorsal part of the hand along with upper extremity functional training home program and the control group performed only upper extremity functional training home program. The intervention was conducted for a total of 30 sessions over 6 weeks. To evaluate changes in upper extremity function, wrist extensor muscle activation via the Surface Electromyography, the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory-9 (CAHAI-9), and the motor activity log (including amount of use and quality of movement) were evaluated. In addition, the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) was evaluated to examine the change in the self- efficacy of the study subjects. The experimental group participating in the kinesio taping and upper limb function home program showed a statistically significant improvement (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.01) before and after the intervention in the Surface Electrography the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory-9 evaluation item in the upper limb function change. The SES evaluation, a self-esteem evaluation, also showed a statistically significant improvement (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.01) before and after the intervention. Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory-9, motor activity log (quality of movement), and SES evaluation showed statistically significant differences (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05) between the experimental and control groups. It was confirmed that the upper extremity function training home program performed in parallel with the kinesio taping technique had a positive effect on the recovery of upper extremity function and self-esteem in stroke patients. The kinesio taping technique provides stability to the wrist while performing a home program that patients can perform on their own at home and appears to improve upper extremity function more effectively than when performing the upper extremity function home program alone.
