Study Title: Acute effects of lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine on social cognition and cognitive performance in a placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects.

Study Summary:
Amphetamines are used as medications but are also misused as cognitive enhancers by healthy subjects and may have additional effects on social cognition. We investigated the acute effects of single, high, equimolar doses of D-amphetamine (40&#xa0;mg) and lisdexamfetamine (100&#xa0;mg) on social cognition and cognitive performance using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design in 24 healthy volunteers. Effects on social cognition were assessed using the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET), and Sexual Arousal Task (SAT). Cognitive performance was measured using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Digit Span (DS), Stop-Signal Task (SST), and Mackworth Clock Test (MCT). D-Amphetamine and lisdexamfetamine had small effects on measures of social cognition. There were no effects on emotion recognition on the FERT. D-Amphetamine increased direct empathy on the MET, but only for positive stimuli. Both amphetamines increased ratings of pleasantness and attractiveness on the SAT in response to sexual but also to neutral stimuli. D-Amphetamine and lisdexamfetamine increased cognitive performance (go-accuracy and vigilance on the SST and MCT, respectively). Lisdexamfetamine increased processing speed on the DSST. Neither drug had an effect on the DS. Single, high, equimolar doses of D-amphetamine and lisdexamfetamine enhanced certain aspects of cognitive performance in healthy non-sleep-deprived subjects. Both amphetamines also slightly altered aspects of social cognition. Whether these small effects also influence social interaction behavior in amphetamine users remains to be investigated. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02668926).
