Study Title: A Well-Being Well-Check for Neurosurgery: Evidence-Based Suggestions for Our Specialty Based on a Systematic Review.

Study Summary:
The path through neurosurgery is rigorous. Many neurosurgeons may experience burnout, depression, or suicide throughout training and practice. We review the literature to help foster a culture of awareness and self-care and arm trainees with coping skills to reduce burnout and, thus, suicidality during all phases of their medical careers. A systematic search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using 4 databases. 7 studies were included. Overlying themes of interventions were to increase balance, mindfulness, and physical fitness. The most common interventions included in programs were educational and physical activity. We suggest a comprehensive wellness program emphasizing interventions from 4 wellness dimensions-physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional. Many neurosurgeons experience burnout, leading to a lack of satisfaction and early retirement; this necessitates a discipline-wide acknowledgment of endemic burnout among neurosurgeons. Systemic changes are needed to refine the training process and prioritize physician well-being- this cannot be left to chance.
