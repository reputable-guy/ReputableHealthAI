Study Title: Preliminary Ef&#xfb01;cacy of Mindfulness and Cognitive Restructuring Interventions to Reduce Nonconsensual Sex Intentions.

Study Summary:
Victims of sexual violence experience detrimental physical and mental health consequences. Therefore, developing programs to prevent sexual violence is of utmost importance. Our previous work provided preliminary support for the ef&#xfb01;cacy of brief mindfulness and cognitive restructuring (CR) interventions in reducing sexual violence intentions. Because alcohol use and alcohol expectancies (AE) have been identi&#xfb01;ed as risk factors for sexual violence, this secondary data analysis aimed to examine whether alcohol use and men's expectations that alcohol may affect women's vulnerability of being sexually coerced moderate the usefulness of these two interventions on nonconsensual sex intentions. Single, young, heterosexual, heavy episodic drinking men with sexual violence histories were randomly assigned to receive mindfulness or CR skills training, or attention control. Half of the participants in each intervention condition were then randomized to alcohol or sober conditions. All participants read a hypothetical sexual scenario and rated their intention to engage in nonconsensual sex with their hypothetical sexual partner. Mindfulness was effective in lowering nonconsensual sex intentions among sober men with high AE for women's vulnerability and intoxicated men with low AE for women's vulnerability to sexual coercion. CR was effective in lowering nonconsensual sex intentions among intoxicated men with low and moderate AE for women's vulnerability to sexual coercion. Our results provide preliminary evidence for the ef&#xfb01;cacy of mindfulness and CR in lowering nonconsensual sex intentions under certain circumstances and highlight men's AE about women's vulnerability to sexual coercion as a critical factor that interacts with alcohol use to in&#xfb02;uence the ef&#xfb01;cacy of mindfulness and CR.
