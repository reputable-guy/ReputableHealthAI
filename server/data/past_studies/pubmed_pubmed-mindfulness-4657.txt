Study Title: Mindfulness based intervention through mobile app for colorectal cancer people awaiting surgery: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide both in men and women. Around one-third of patients with cancer will suffer from anxiety or depression symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention through a mobile application ("En Calma en el Quir&#xf3;fano"). This study is a multicenter, single-blind (evaluator), controlled, randomised trial that compares the effectiveness of a mindfulness training through a mobile application (intervention group) and treatment as usual (control group) in three different moments (T0 or baseline, T1 or hospital discharge and T2 or one month after surgery). Anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS), quality of life (WHOQOL), pain, (VAS) and satisfaction (CSQ) were assessed. In all, there were 270 referred patients. Among them, 39 and 43 were assigned to the intervention and control groups respectively. 82 patients were analyzed: 39 patients used the app, and 43 patients continued with the treatment as usual. There were no significant changes between groups and time. We observed a slight trend in which intervention group had less depression and anxiety symptoms since T0 and T2 (B&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.2; 95% CI between 8.8 and 9.2). The sample of this study had a high mean age (65 years old), and low levels of anxiety and depression and medium levels of pre-surgery quality of life in baseline. These factors could have influenced limiting the effectiveness of the app. Prospective research lines should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of mobile applications for younger patients with surgical pathologies.
