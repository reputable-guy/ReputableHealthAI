Study Title: Clinical effects of walking exercise program for older adults applied with an exercise assist robot (Bot Fit): A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Interval walking exercise (IWE) consists of repeated walking for 3&#xa0;min with high intensity, followed by 3&#xa0;min of walking with low intensity. A wearable robot is an exoskeleton system that is worn on the body and helps the body move. The purpose of this study is to verify the effects of performing IWE using Bot Fit (Samsung Electronics, Korea) on older adults. The experimental group (EG; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) performed the IWE program with Bot Fit, and the control group (CG; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12) performed the IWE program without Bot Fit, three times a week for six weeks. Both groups were evaluated for spatio-temporal parameters, pelvic movement, function, muscle power, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) at before, after three weeks and after six weeks of exercise. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the pelvic tilt range after six weeks of exercise (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The pelvic rotation range showed a significant difference after six weeks of exercise in the EG (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). During the stance phase, rectus abdominis (RA) muscle power and its contraction ratio significantly increased after six weeks of exercise in the EG (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The WHR was significantly lower after six weeks of exercise in EG than in the CG (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Bot Fit maximizes the normal walking effect, promotes correct posture and physical activity to prevent falls, improves quality of life (QOL). It has shown clinical effects and has been used for successful aging of older adults.
