Study Title: The efficacy of myofascial release at the cervicothoracic region in patients with rotator cuff repairs: A randomized controlled pilot study.

Study Summary:
Coactivation between tonic and phasic muscles is essential for correct posture and movement. Impaired movement patterns and postural changes facilitate the flexor response to protect painful tissue in the injured area. Tone changes between tonic and phasic muscles lead to an imbalance in the rotator cuff (RC) muscles. A randomized controlled pilot study. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of applying myofascial release (MFR) to the muscles in the cervicothoracic region for the treatment of fascia limitations in patients with postoperative RC tear. A total of 20 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The patients in the control group performed exercises, whereas those in the MFR group performed exercises in addition to MFR. Pain intensity, grip strength, pectoralis minor flexibility, Constant Murley Score (CMS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) score were evaluated. Pain intensity was recorded before and after the MFR sessions. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding pain, grip strength, pectoralis minor flexibility, CMS values, or SF-36 score (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). There were significant differences in pain levels measured before and after all MFR sessions. Moreover, a significant decrease is shown between the first and last sessions in the MFR group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). MFR can be useful, especially in postoperative RC patients who have pain in the early period. Significant reductions in pain intensity after MFR can help prepare patients for exercise and reduce pain-related medication use.
