Study Title: Pseudomyopia treated with auricular point sticking combined with periocular needle-embedding therapy and prevention of true myopia: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To observe the clinical effect and safety of auricular point sticking combined with periocular needle-embedding therapy for pseudomyopia and prevention of true myopia. A total of 269 children with pseudomyopia were randomized into an observation group (134 cases, 2 cases dropped out) and a control group (135 cases, 5 cases dropped out). In the control group, the healthy education was provided. In the observation group, besides the intervention as the control group, the auricular point sticking was delivered at gan (CO), pi (CO), xin (CO) and yan (LO) on one ear in each treatment, combined with periocular needle-embedding technique at bilateral Cuanzhu (BL 2), Yuyao (EX-HN 4) and Sibai (ST 2). There were 2 weeks of interval after 4 weeks of treatment. One course of treatment was composed of 6 weeks and 2 courses were required. Separately, before treatment, after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, and after 12 weeks (the 1st follow-up visit) and 24 weeks (the 2nd follow-up visit) of treatment completion, the spherical equivalent (SE), SE progression, axial length (AL) progression, accommodative amplitude (AMP), the score of the TCM symptom and the general symptom were observed in the two groups. The safety and compliance were evaluated in the two groups. After 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, and in the 1st and 2nd follow-up visits, SE increased when compared with that before treatment in the two groups (0.05), and AMP was larger than that before treatment in the observation group (<0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment, and in the 1st and 2nd follow-up visits, the progression of SE was slower in the observation group compared with that in the control group (<0.01,0.001). After 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, and in the 1st and 2nd follow-up visits, the progression of AL in the observation group was lower than that of the control group (0.05,0.01,0.001); and in the 1st and 2nd follow-up visits, AMP of the observation group was larger when compared with that in the control group (0.05,0.001). After 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, and in the 1st and 2nd follow-up visits, the total scores of TCM symptom and general symptom were reduced in comparison with those before treatment in the observation group (0.05); after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment, the total scores of TCM symptom and general symptom were lower than those before treatment in the control group (0.05). In the 1st and 2nd follow-up visits, the difference of the total score of TCM symptom and general symptom in the observation group was larger than that of the control group (<0.05). In the observation group, compared with the control group, the scores for pale/dark complexion in the 1st and 2nd follow-up visits and that for lassitude in the 2nd follow-up visit were lower (0.05), the score for poor concentration after 12 weeks of treatment and that for poor sleep and memory in the 2nd follow-up visit were lower (0.05). There were no adverse reactions in the two groups. The compliance was 98.5% in the observation group and was 96.3% in the control group, without statistical difference (0.05). On the basis of health education, auricular point sticking combined with periocular needle-embedding therapy can effectively prevent from true myopia, control the increase of SE, delay the growth of AL and improve AMP in children with pseudomyopia. This compound therapeutic regimen can relieve the general symptom and comprehensively prevent from myopia through multiple approaches, with high safety and satisfactory compliance.
