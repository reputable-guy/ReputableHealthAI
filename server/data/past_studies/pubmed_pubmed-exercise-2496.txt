Study Title: Resistance exercise in early-stage ALS patients, ALSFRS-R, Sickness Impact Profile ALS-19, and muscle transcriptome: a pilot study.

Study Summary:
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients lack effective treatments to maintain motor and neuromuscular function. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a home-based exercise program on muscle strength, ALS scores, and transcriptome in ALS patients, Clinical Trials.gov #NCT03201991 (28/06/2017). An open-label, non-randomized pilot clinical trial was conducted in seven individuals with early-stage ALS. Participants were given 3&#xa0;months of home-based resistance exercise focusing on the quadriceps muscles. The strength of exercised muscle was evaluated using bilateral quadriceps strength with manual muscle testing, handheld dynamometers, five times sit-to-stand, and Timed-Up-and-Go before and after the exercise program. In addition, changes in the Sickness Impact Profile ALS-19 (SIP/ALS-19) as the functional outcome measure and the transcriptome of exercised muscles were compared before and after the exercise. The primary outcome of muscle strength did not change significantly by the exercise program. The exercise program maintained the SIP/ALS-19 and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Transcriptome analysis revealed that exercise reverted the expression level of genes decreased in ALS, including parvalbumin. Three months of moderately intense strength and conditioning exercise maintained muscle strength of the exercised muscle and ALSFRS-R scores and had a positive effect on patients' muscle transcriptome.
