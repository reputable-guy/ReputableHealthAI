Study Title: Mental Health Needs of Inpatient Psychiatric Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Study Summary:
The lack of mental health supports and resources for psychiatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to stress, burnout, and reduced mental wellness. Simultaneously, the pandemic's safety mitigation measures made significant changes to the inpatient psychiatric population environment making it difficult to maintain a therapeutic milieu and increased mental health challenges among staff and patients. This study aimed to identify external and internal resilience factors, mental health support, and resources provided by organizations, and additional mental health support and resources inpatient psychiatric nurses felt would have been beneficial during the pandemic. An anonymous web-based survey was administered via American Psychiatric Nurses Association Member Bridge. Notably, 68 respondents represented 23 states across the United States. Interpersonal peer relationships, self-awareness, self-care, mindfulness, and purpose were identified resilience factors. Free counseling, decompression rooms, pastoral support, self-care discounts, and support groups were top support and resource options. Policies, time-off, personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, counseling and self-care, and appreciation were major themes reflecting what participants thought would have been beneficial. Coping strategies, organizational support, resilience, altruism, and family and peer support were instrumental in psychiatric nurses' survival during the pandemic. Identifying factors of resilience is key to supporting and protecting the mental health of psychiatric nurses. Organizations can better support their nurses when they understand what mental health support and resource options are perceived as most beneficial by inpatient nurses.
