Study Title: Analgesic effect of dance movement therapy: An fNIRS study.

Study Summary:
This study aims to explores the physiological and psychological mechanisms of exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) by combining the behavioral results with neuroimaging data on changes oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) in prefrontal cortex (PFC). A total of 97 healthy participants were recruited and randomly divided into three groups: a single dance movement therapy (DMT) group, a double DMT group, and control group. Evaluation indicators included the pressure pain threshold (PPT) test, the color-word stroop task (CWST) for wearing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and the self-assessment manikin (SAM). The testing time is before intervention, after intervention, and one hour of sit rest after intervention. 1) Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that, there is a time * group effect on the PPT values of the three groups of participants at three time points. After 30 min of acute dance intervention, an increase in the PPT values of 10 test points occurred in the entire body of the participants in the experimental group with a significant difference than the control group. 2) In terms of fNIRS signals, bilateral DLPFC and left VLPFC channels were significantly activated in the experimental group. 3) DMT significantly awakened participants and brought about pleasant emotions, but cognitive improvement was insignificant. 4) Mediation effect analysis found that the change in HbO concentration in DLPFC may be a mediator in predicting the degree of improvement in pressure pain threshold through dance intervention (total effect &#x3b2; = 0.7140). In healthy adults, DMT can produce a diffuse EIH effect on improving pressure pain threshold, emotional experience but only showing an improvement trend in cognitive performance. Dance intervention significantly activates the left ventrolateral and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This study explores the central nervous system mechanism of EIH from a physiological and psychological perspective.
