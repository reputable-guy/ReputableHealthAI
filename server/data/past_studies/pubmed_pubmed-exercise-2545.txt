Study Title: Optimizing antidepressant benefits: Effect of theta burst stimulation treatment in physically active people with treatment-resistant depression.

Study Summary:
Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a promising therapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD), but a significant proportion of individuals do not respond adequately, necessitating alternative approaches. This study explores whether individuals meeting minimum recommended physical activity levels demonstrate better responses to TBS compared to physically inactive individuals. Using data from a randomized controlled trial (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;43), participants were categorized as physically active or inactive based on baseline International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores. Depression scores (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item; HRSD-17) were assessed at baseline, 4, and 6&#xa0;weeks of TBS treatment. A significant Time X Group effect adjusted for age and baseline depression was observed. Physically active individuals consistently exhibited lower depression scores across time points. At 4 and 6&#xa0;weeks, there was a significant increase in between-group differences, indicating that the physically active group derived greater benefits from treatment. At 6&#xa0;weeks, a significantly higher proportion of responders (&#x2265;50&#xa0;% HRSD-17 reduction) were observed in the physically active compared to inactive group. Physical activity significantly contributed to regression and logistic models predicting treatment response. These findings support the potential role of baseline physical activity in enhancing TBS therapy for MDD.
