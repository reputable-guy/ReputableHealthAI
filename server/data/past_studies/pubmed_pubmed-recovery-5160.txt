Study Title: Effectiveness of the Individualized Self-Care Program Based on Orem's Self-Care Theory: Impact on Learning Needs and Self-Care Behaviors Following Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery - A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the specific learning needs of patients within the experimental group after receiving the Individualized Self-Care Program (ISCP) at two key time points: Time 2 (Day 2, Week 1) and Time 3 (Day 15, Week 3). Furthermore, it aimed to compare the effectiveness of the ISCP in improving self-care behavior between the experimental group and the control group, which received standard health education. The study utilized a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and included a consecutive sample of 128 patients who had undergone their first Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) procedure. These patients were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;64) and the control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;64). The experimental group received an ISCP at Time 2 and Time 3 after being discharged, whereas the control group received standard health education. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests to assess differences in learning needs over time and Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the effectiveness of the ISCP on self-care behavior. A paired t-test indicated a statistically significant difference in the total number of learning needs identified within the experimental group between Time 2 and Time 3 assessments. Patients in the experimental group initially identified more learning needs at Time 2 (4.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.5), but their knowledge significantly improved at Time 3, leading to fewer learning needs (2.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.1). Furthermore, an ANOVA comparing the experimental and control groups showed that the ISCP effectively improved self-care behavior in the experimental group, with significantly greater improvements compared to the control group, which received standard health education. ISCP delivered in early recovery enhances self-care behaviors and addresses postdischarge gaps. The study also revealed that patients' learning needs change over time during home recovery, emphasizing the importance of tailored self-care programs for CABG patients after discharge. IRCT registration number: ISRCTN96836216.
