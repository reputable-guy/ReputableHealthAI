Study Title: Losing sleep influences dietary intake in children: a longitudinal compositional analysis of a randomised crossover trial.

Study Summary:
Although inadequate sleep increases the risk of obesity in children, the mechanisms remain unclear. The aims of this study were to assess how sleep loss influenced dietary intake in children while accounting for corresponding changes in sedentary time and physical activity; and to investigate how changes in time use related to dietary intake. A randomized crossover trial in 105 healthy children (8-12&#xa0;years) with normal sleep (~&#x2009;8-11&#xa0;h/night) compared sleep extension (asked to turn lights off one hour earlier than usual for one week) and sleep restriction (turn lights off one hour later) conditions, separated by a washout week. 24-h time-use behaviors (sleep, wake after sleep onset, physical activity, sedentary time) were assessed using waist-worn actigraphy and dietary intake using two multiple-pass diet recalls during each intervention week. Longitudinal compositional analysis was undertaken with mixed effects regression models using isometric log ratios of time use variables as exposures and dietary variables as outcomes, and participant as a random effect. Eighty three children (10.2&#xa0;years, 53% female, 62% healthy weight) had 47.9 (SD 30.1) minutes less sleep during the restriction week but were also awake for 8.5 (21.4) minutes less at night. They spent this extra time awake in the day being more sedentary (+&#x2009;31&#xa0;min) and more active (+&#x2009;21&#xa0;min light physical activity,&#x2009;+&#x2009;4&#xa0;min MVPA). After adjusting for all changes in 24-h time use, losing 48&#xa0;min of sleep was associated with consuming significantly more energy (262&#xa0;kJ, 95% CI:55,470), all of which was from non-core foods (314&#xa0;kJ; 43, 638). Increases in sedentary time were related to increased energy intake from non-core foods (177&#xa0;kJ; 25, 329) whereas increases in MVPA were associated with higher intake from core foods (72&#xa0;kJ; 7,136). Changes in diet were greater in female participants. Loss of sleep was associated with increased energy intake, especially of non-core foods, independent of changes in sedentary time and physical activity. Interventions focusing on improving sleep may be beneficial for improving dietary intake and weight status in children.
