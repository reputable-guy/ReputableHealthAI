Study Title: The Effect of Aromatherapy with Lavender Essential Oil on the Sleep and Fatigue Level of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis in Turkey: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Fatigue is a common problem in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is one of the most serious symptoms of the disease. Although many factors play a role in the etiology of fatigue in patients with MS, it has been reported that fatigue is caused by irregular or disrupted sleep patterns. The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of lavender oil aromatherapy on the sleep and fatigue of MS patients. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial and was conducted in Turkey. The data of the study were collected using the Patient Description Form, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The mean FSS score in the experimental group was 6.86 &#xb1; 0.94 before the procedure and 3.42 &#xb1; 0.85 after the procedure, the mean PSQI score was 9.45 &#xb1; 1.23 before the procedure and 6.68 &#xb1; 2.87 after the procedure, and the difference in the mean scores between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.001). The results showed that aromatherapy with lavender essential oil has significant impacts on fatigue and sleep in MS patients. Lavender essential oil aromatherapy can be used by nurses as an independent nursing practice. It is an inexpensive, noninvasive, and reliable technique to manage fatigue in individuals with MS.
