Study Title: The effect of a selenium-based anti-inflammatory strategy on postoperative functional recovery in high-risk cardiac surgery patients - A nested sub-study of the sustain CSX trial.

Study Summary:
The cardiac surgery-related ischemia-reperfusion-related oxidative stress triggers the release of cytotoxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, contributing to organ failure and ultimately influencing patients' short- and long-term outcomes. Selenium is an essential co-factor for various antioxidant enzymes, thereby contributing to the patients' endogenous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms. Given these selenium's pleiotropic functions, we investigated the effect of a high-dose selenium-based anti-inflammatory perioperative strategy on functional recovery after cardiac surgery. This prospective study constituted a nested sub-study of the SUSTAIN CSX trial, a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial to investigate the impact of high-dose selenium supplementation on high-risk cardiac surgery patients' postoperative recovery. Functional recovery was assessed by 6-min walk distance, Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Barthel Index questionnaires. 174 patients were included in this sub-study. The mean age (SD) was 67.3 (8.9) years, and 78.7&#xa0;% of the patients were male. The mean (SD) predicted 30-day mortality by the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score was 12.6&#xa0;% (9.4&#xa0;%). There was no difference at hospital discharge and after three months in the 6-min walk distance between the selenium and placebo groups (131&#xa0;m [IQR: not performed - 269] vs. 160&#xa0;m [IQR: not performed - 252], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.80 and 400&#xa0;m [IQR: 299-461] vs. 375&#xa0;m [IQR: 65-441], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.48). The SF-36 and Barthel Index assessments also revealed no clinically meaningful differences between the selenium and placebo groups. A perioperative anti-inflammatory strategy with high-dose selenium supplementation did not improve functional recovery in high-risk cardiac surgery patients.
