Study Title: Omega-3 nanoemulgel in prevention of radiation-induced oral mucositis and its associated effect on microbiome: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Oral mucositis (OM) is recognized as one of the most frequent debilitating sequelae encountered by head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated by radiotherapy. This results in severe mucosal tissue inflammation and oral ulcerations that interfere with patient's nutrition, quality of life (QoL) and survival. Omega-3 (&#x3c9;-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have recently gained special interest in dealing with oral diseases owing to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and wound healing properties. Thus, this study aims to assess topical Omega-3 nanoemulgel efficacy in prevention of radiation-induced oral mucositis and regulation of oral microbial dysbiosis. Thirty-four head and neck cancer patients planned to receive radiotherapy were randomly allocated into two groups: Group I: conventional preventive treatment and Group II: topical Omega-3 nanoemulgel. Patients were evaluated at baseline, three and six weeks after treatment using the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for oral mucositis severity, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for perceived pain severity, and MD-Anderson Symptom Inventory for Head and Neck cancer (MDASI-HN) for QoL. Oral swabs were collected to assess oral microbiome changes. VAS scores and WHO mucositis grades were significantly lower after six weeks of treatment with topical Omega-3 nanoemulgel when compared to the conventional treatment. The total MDASI score was significantly higher in the control group after three weeks of treatment, and the head and neck subscale differed significantly at both three and six weeks. A significant reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was observed after six weeks in the test group indicating less microbial dysbiosis. Topical Omega-3 nanoemulgel demonstrated a beneficial effect in prevention of radiation-induced oral mucositis with a possibility of regulating oral microbial dysbiosis.
