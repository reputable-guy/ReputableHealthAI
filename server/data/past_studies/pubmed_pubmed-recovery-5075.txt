Study Title: Effects of multiple cold-water immersion during pre-season on recovery performance in under-20 male soccer players: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of multiple cold-water immersions performed daily during the preseason period on biochemical, clinical, and neuromuscular aspects of muscle damage of soccer players. This two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized controlled trial, blinded to statistician and assessors, was conducted at professional football club facilities. Twenty-three under-20 semi-professionals male soccer players were randomly allocated into cold water immersion group (bathtub with water and ice at 10&#xa0;&#xb0;C&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1&#xa0;&#xb0;C for 10&#xa0;min) or control group (rest for 10&#xa0;min), every day, after training sessions during a preseason. Primary outcome was change in creatine kinase (CK) concentration, and secondary outcomes were changes in vertical jump performance, strength and perception of recovery at baseline (T0) and after protocol training (T1). Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant time-group interactions for CK concentration, with an average reduction of 280.39 U/L (CI95%&#xa0;=&#xa0;-519.14, -41.64; d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.55) in the cold-water immersion compared to the control group. No differences between groups were observed in any other measures. Multiple cold-water immersions at 10&#xa0;&#xb0;C for 10&#xa0;min decreases CK concentration but does not change any clinical and neuromuscular markers of muscle damage in soccer players during a 9-day preseason.
