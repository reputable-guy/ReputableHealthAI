Study Title: 'Making a connection': a qualitative study of experiences from a cancer telerehabilitation program.

Study Summary:
Specialised group-based exercise rehabilitation is beneficial for cancer survivors but access to these services is limited. Telerehabilitation provides an opportunity to expand reach, but we do not know about the experiences of those who participate in this way. This study explored participant experiences of an exercise-based telerehabilitation program for people with cancer. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was completed. Twenty-two cancer survivors were purposively sampled from the experimental group of a randomised controlled trial evaluating exercise-based cancer telerehabilitation delivered in groups using synchronous videoconferencing. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were coded independently by two reviewers and analysed inductively by thematic analysis. 'A feeling of connection' was the overarching theme. Participants perceived they connected with the health service, expert health professionals, and peers through participating in the telerehabilitation program. These connections provided a personalised rehabilitation experience and improved perceptions of physical and emotional well-being. Two subthemes suggested connection was facilitated by (1) the acceptability of telerehabilitation and (2) enhanced accountability to exercise. Participants felt disconnected when they were unable to participate in the program due to cancer treatment and side effects (e.g. fatigue), feeling unwell, and co-morbidities. We identified that telerehabilitation facilitated connections that enhanced the reach of exercise to cancer survivors. Our findings support using telerehabilitation to deliver specialised group-based exercise programs alongside more traditional models of care to increase participation in exercise among people with cancer.
