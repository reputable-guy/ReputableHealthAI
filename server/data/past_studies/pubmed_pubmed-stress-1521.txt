Study Title: Curcumin Reduces Depression in Obese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Type 2 diabetes and depression co-occur in a bidirectional manner. Curcumin supplements exhibit antidepressant effects that may mitigate depression by modulating neurotransmitters and reducing inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin in improving depression severity in obese type 2 diabetes patients. The study employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design with 227 participants. The primary end-point was depression severity assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Biomarkers were measured at baseline and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals. The biomarkers assessed were serotonin levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), antioxidant activities (total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase), and malondialdehyde. After 12 months, the curcumin group exhibited significantly improved depression severity (= 0.000001). The curcumin group had higher levels of serotonin (< 0.0001) but lower levels of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (< 0.001 for all) than the placebo group. Total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase activity, and superoxide dismutase activity were elevated in the curcumin group, whereas malondialdehyde levels were greater in the placebo group (< 0.001 for all). These findings suggest curcumin may have antidepressant effects on obese type 2 diabetes patients.
