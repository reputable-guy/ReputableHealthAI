Study Title: Effect of the Home to Hospital to Home nutrition management program on postoperative liver cancer patients: A single-center randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition is the most common complication in postoperative liver cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the Home to Hospital to Home nutrition management program on postoperative liver cancer patients. A total of 184 liver cancer patients were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (treated under the Home to Hospital to Home nutrition management program) or a control group (treated with the general nutritional method). Nutrition-related indicators, such as prealbumin (PA) and albumin, were assessed before and after treatment in both groups. The incidence of complications (e.g., nausea or vomiting, bloating, difficulty defecating, ascites), length of hospital stay, first time to anal exhaust and out-of-bed activity, and patient satisfaction were recorded.

Nutrition-related indicators, such as prealbumin (PA) and albumin, were assessed before and after treatment in both groups. The incidence of complications (e.g., nausea or vomiting, bloating, difficulty defecating, ascites), length of hospital stay, first time to anal exhaust and out-of-bed activity, and patient satisfaction were recorded. The Home to Hospital to Home nutrition management program improves the nutritional status of postoperative liver cancer patients, lowers the incidence of complications, shortens hospital stays, increases patient satisfaction, and promotes the early recovery of patients.
