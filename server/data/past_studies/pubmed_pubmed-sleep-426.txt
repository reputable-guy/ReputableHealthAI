Study Title: Comparison between botulinum toxin type A injection on masseter muscle only and additional injection on anterior belly of digastric muscle in sleep bruxism patients: A clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This study aims to evaluate the effects on bite force and muscle thickness of the botulinum toxin (BoNT) injection for patients with sleep bruxism (SB) by comparing injections into the masseter muscle only and both the masseter and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle (ABDM) in a clinical trial. Twelve SB patients received BoNT-A injections using US-guided techniques into the masseter muscle only (Group A), while the remaining 12 SB patients received injections into both the masseter and ABDM (Group B). Bite force and muscle thickness were measured before injection, as well as 1 and 2&#x2009;months after injection. The bite force and masseter muscle thickness decreased in both Group A and Group B before injection, and at 1 and 2&#x2009;months after injection. However, there was no significant difference (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05, repeated measures analysis of variance) between the two groups, and there was also no significant difference in ABDM thickness (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05, repeated measures analysis of variance). This study is the first to assess the short-term effects of BoNT injected into ABDM for SB control. Results show no influence on SB reduction, suggesting the need for further research on BoNT's effectiveness in controlling intense ABDM contractions during sleep and assessing suprahyoid muscle potential impact on rhythmic masticatory muscle activity occurrence.
