Study Title: Facilitating Nutrition and Physical Activity-Focused Policy, Systems, and Environmental Change in Rural Areas: A Methodological Approach Using Community Wellness Coalitions and Cooperative Extension.

Study Summary:
Obesity prevalence is higher among rural populations than urban, which may be related to differences in environments. Rural counties face barriers to accessing healthy foods and physical activity opportunities including isolation, transportation distances, and lack of facilities. As part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity High Obesity Program, community-based wellness coalitions were established in six South Dakota counties with adult obesity prevalence >40%. The community coalitions were charged with improving access to healthy foods and safe and accessible places to participate in physical activity within their rural, underserved communities. Coalitions were created and members were recruited by Cooperative Extension staff who had existing relationships with key stakeholders within the community. Within these coalitions, champions were identified to provide leadership and ensure project implementation. Ongoing support and technical assistance were provided to the community coalitions by Cooperative Extension staff as they completed a community needs assessment, disseminated results of the needs assessment with the community, created action plans based on needs assessment data, implemented evidence-based interventions to support nutrition and physical activity policy, system and environmental changes, and assessed impact within their community. Overall, the purpose of this article is to share the project methodology, which capitalized on using Cooperative Extension, to build capacity to improve the nutrition and physical activity environment in rural, unserved communities. Sustainability of this work, along with lessons learned, is also discussed.
