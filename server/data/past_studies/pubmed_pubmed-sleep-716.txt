Study Title: Effects of a work schedule with abated quick returns on insomnia, sleepiness, and work-related fatigue: results from a large-scale cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of a work schedule with abated quick returns (i.e.&#x2005;>&#x2005;11 hours between two shifts) on insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and work-related fatigue compared to a shift schedule maintaining the usual number of quick returns. A two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial including 66 units was conducted at a university hospital in Norway. Units with healthcare workers on rotating shift schedules were randomly assigned to a shift schedule with abated quick returns (intervention) or to continue with a schedule including quick returns as usual (control) for 6 months. Questionnaires assessed symptoms of insomnia (Bergen Insomnia Scale [BIS]), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]), and work-related fatigue (Revised Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory) at baseline and towards the end of the intervention. Data were analyzed using multilevel linear mixed-effects models, and Cohen's d was used to calculate the effect size between groups. Overall, 1314 healthcare workers (85.2% female) completed the baseline questionnaire (response rate 49.1%), and 552 completed the follow-up questionnaire. The intervention reduced quick returns from an average of 13.2 (SD = 8.7) to 6.7 (SD =&#x2005;6.0), while the control group's average remained relatively unchanged from 13.2 (SD&#x2005;=&#x2005;8.7) to 12.0 (SD&#x2005;=&#x2005;9.3). Results showed a small improvement in symptoms of insomnia (BIS; d&#x2005;=&#x2005;-0.13, p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.022) and daytime sleepiness (ESS; d&#x2005;=&#x2005;-0.14, p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.013) in favor of the intervention. No effects were observed on work-related fatigue. Reducing the number of quick returns in the work schedule resulted in improvements in insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The findings highlight the importance of sufficient daily rest time in the work schedule of healthcare workers.
