Study Title: The Effect of Sn-2 Palmitate on Blood Glucose, Lipids and Body Composition in Middle-Aged and Elderly Adults: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Sn-2 palmitate is widely used in infant formula. However, little is known about its effects on metabolism and body composition in middle-aged and elderly adults. In a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, we enrolled Chinese adults aged 45-75 years with self-reported constipation. Individuals were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a 1,3-dioleoyl-2-palmitoyl-glycerol (OPO)-enriched oil (66% palmitic acid in the sn-2 position) or a control vegetable oil (24% palmitic acid in the sn-2 position) daily for 24 weeks. Skim milk powder was used as the carrier for both fats. Interviews and body composition were performed at baseline, week 4, week 12 and week 24. A fasting blood draw was taken except at week 4. This study was a secondary analysis and considered exploratory. A total of 111 adults (83 women and 28 men, mean age 64.2 &#xb1; 7.0 years) were enrolled, of whom 53 were assigned to the OPO group and 57 to the control group. During the intervention, blood glucose, triglyceride, the triglyceride-glucose index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol remained stable, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased in both groups (= 0.003). No differences in change were observed between the groups (all> 0.05). From baseline to week 24, the level of visceral fat increased slightly (= 0.017), while body weight, total body water, protein, soft lean mass, fat-free mass, skeletal muscle and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) decreased in two groups (< 0.01). At weeks 4, 12 and 24, the SMI decreased less in the OPO group than in the control group, with a trend towards significance (= 0.090). A 24-week daily intake of sn-2-palmitate-enriched oil had no adverse impact on fasting blood glucose, lipids and body composition compared with the control vegetable oil in Chinese adults (funded by Chinese Nutrition Society National Nutrition Science Research Grant, National Key Research and Development Program of China and Wilmar (Shanghai) Biotechnology Research & Development Center Co., Ltd.; ChiCTR1900026480).
