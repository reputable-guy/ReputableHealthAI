Study Title: Effect of electromagnetic stimulation combined with visceral manipulation on stress urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of the study is to determine how electromagnetic stimulation and visceral manipulation can improve pelvic floor strength and reduce the severity of symptoms of postmenopausal stress urinary incontinence (SUI). This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 50 postmenopausal female participants aged 50-66 years with a body mass index (BMI)&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;30&#xa0;kg/m2. Participants were equally randomized into the study (A) and control (B) groups. The study group (A) underwent 36 pulsed electromagnetic stimulation (PEMS) sessions (20&#xa0;min/session; 3 sessions a week/12 weeks), 12 sessions of visceral manipulation therapy (VMT) maneuvers (once weekly/weeks), and 24 supervised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) sessions (45-60&#xa0;min/session; twice weekly/12 weeks), along with general advice. For 12 weeks, the control group (B) received the same PFMT and general advice. Kegel perineometer was used to measure vaginal squeeze pressure (VSP) and the urogenital distress inventory questionnaire-short form (UDI-6) to assess the severity of urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms in both groups before and after the treatment. The results revealed statistically significant improvements (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) in both VSP and UDI-6 scores in group A compared to group B. Electromagnetic stimulation combined with visceral manipulation and supervised PFMT is more efficient than PFMT alone on SUI in postmenopausal women. Therefore, it is advisable to incorporate this combined approach into pelvic floor rehabilitation programs.
