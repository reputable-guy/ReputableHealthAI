Study Title: Intensity and volume of physical exercise influence DOMS and skin temperature differently in healthy adults.

Study Summary:
It remains unclear whether exercises leading to different outcomes of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) may also elicit different skin temperature responses. The aim of this study was to determine whether different intensities and volumes of a single-joint exercise influence the DOMS and skin temperature measurements differently in healthy adults. Thirty-nine men and women were randomly assigned to three groups performing different exercise of different intensities and volumes (Exhaustion, Fatigue, Submaximal) to induce DOMS in the biceps brachii. DOMS (numeric pain rate scale, NPRS), pressure pain threshold (PPT) and skin temperature (infrared thermography, IRT) were measured on exercise day and 48&#xa0;h later. The different exercises resulted in lower PPT responses 48&#xa0;h after exercise and different DOMS reported across the different groups. Skin temperature outcomes did not differ following the different protocols. We found an increased minimum skin temperature 48&#xa0;h after exercise in groups performing more intense exercises, but such differences were found in both exercised and non-exercised arms. Differently of PPT outcomes, pain reported depended on exercise intensity, and skin temperature 48&#xa0;h after exercise could not show acute exercise adaptations. Skin temperature responses are contingent upon the characteristics of the participants rather than exercise intensity.
