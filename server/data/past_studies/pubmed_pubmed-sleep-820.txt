Study Title: Effects of periodic breathing on sleep at high altitude: a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study using inspiratory CO.

Study Summary:
Hypoxia at high altitude facilitates changes in ventilatory control that can lead to nocturnal periodic breathing (nPB). Here, we introduce a placebo-controlled approach to prevent nPB by increasing inspiratory COand used it to assess whether nPB contributes to the adverse effects of hypoxia on sleep architecture. In a randomized, single-blinded, crossover design, 12 men underwent two sojourns (three days/nights each, separated by 4&#xa0;weeks) in hypobaric hypoxia corresponding to 4000&#xa0;m altitude, with polysomnography during the first and third night of each sojourn. During all nights, subjects' heads were encompassed by a canopy retaining exhaled CO, and COconcentration in the canopy (i.e. inspiratory COconcentration) was controlled by adjustment of fresh air inflow. Throughout the placebo sojourn inspiratory COwas &#x2264;0.2%, whereas throughout the other sojourn it was increased to 1.76% (IQR, 1.07%-2.44%). During the placebo sojourn, total sleep time (TST) with nPB was 54.3% (37.4%-80.8%) and 45.0% (24.5%-56.5%) during the first and the third night, respectively (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.042). Increased inspiratory COreduced TST with nPB by an absolute 38.1% (28.1%-48.1%), the apnoea-hypopnoea index by 58.1/h (40.1-76.1/h), and oxygen desaturation index &#x2265;3% by 56.0/h (38.9.1-73.2/h) (all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), whereas it increased the mean arterial oxygen saturation in TST by 2.0% (0.4%-3.5%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.035). Increased inspiratory COslightly increased the percentage of N3&#xa0;sleep during the third night (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.045), without other effects on sleep architecture. Increasing inspiratory COeffectively prevented hypoxia-induced nPB without affecting sleep macro-architecture, indicating that nPB does not explain the sleep deterioration commonly observed at high altitudes. KEY POINTS: Periodic breathing is common during sleep at high altitude, and it is unclear how this affects sleep architecture. We developed a placebo-controlled approach to prevent nocturnal periodic breathing (nPB) with inspiratory COadministration and used it to assess the effects of nPB on sleep in hypobaric hypoxia. Nocturnal periodic breathing was effectively mitigated by an increased inspiratory COfraction in a blinded manner. Prevention of nPB did not lead to relevant changes in sleep architecture in hypobaric hypoxia. We conclude that nPB does not explain the deterioration in sleep architecture commonly observed at high altitude.
