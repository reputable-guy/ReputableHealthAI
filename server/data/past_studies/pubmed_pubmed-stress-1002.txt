Study Title: Effects of synbiotics surpass probiotics alone in improving type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Combining probiotics and prebiotics in synbiotics may present a synergistic approach to improve type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, further evidence is required to establish the comparative efficacy of synbiotics versus probiotics. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis MN-Gup (MN-Gup) and a synbiotic mixture of MN-Gup and galactooligosaccharide (MN-Gup-GOS) on glycemic control in T2DM patients and explore possible mechanisms. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assigned 120 T2DM patients, to receive MN-Gup, MN-Gup-GOS, or placebo intervention for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was fasting blood glucose (FBG), with secondary outcomes including hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), inflammatory indicators, oxidative stress indicators, gastrointestinal hormones, gut microbiota, and bile acids (BAs). The median age of the 120 participants was 59 years (interquartile range: 55-62 years), with 40 being men. Compared to baseline, all three groups exhibited significant reductions in FBG. Additionally, the MN-Gup-GOS group demonstrated significant decreases in HbA1c, serum insulin, and HOMA-IR after intervention, whereas no such reductions were observed in the placebo and MN-Gup groups. Regarding the between-group comparisons, the MN-Gup-GOS intervention showed a significantly greater reduction in FBG compared to the placebo (least squares mean difference [95&#xa0;% CI],&#xa0;-0.69 [-1.29,&#xa0;-0.10] mmol/L, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022) and MN-Gup (-0.59 [-1.17,&#xa0;-0.01], P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.047) group, but not for other indicators of glucose metabolism. Additionally, MN-Gup and MN-Gup-GOS intervention, especially the latter, significantly modified inflammation, oxidative stress, gut microbiota, serum BAs, and GLP-1 levels. Correlation analysis showed significant associations between changes in certain gut microbiota (Bifidobacterium) and BAs (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) with glycemic indicators. The auxiliary effect of synbiotics MN-Gup-GOS on reducing FBG levels surpassed that of MN-Gup probiotics alone in T2DM patients, potentially attributed to the enhanced modulation of gut microbiota, BAs, and GLP-1 secretion.
