Study Title: Effect of tailored on-road driving lessons on driving safety in older adults: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
We evaluated the effectiveness of individually tailored driving lessons compared with a road rules refresher course for improving older driver safety. Two arm parallel randomised controlled trial, involving current drivers aged 65 and older (Mean age 72.0, 47.4% male) residing in Canberra, Australia. The intervention group (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;28) received a two-hour class-based road rules refresher course, and two one-hour driving lessons tailored to improve poor driving skills and habits identified in a baseline on-road assessment. The control group (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;29) received the road rules refresher course only. Tests of cognitive performance, and on-road driving were conducted at baseline and at 12-weeks. Main outcome measure was the Driver safety rating (DSR) on the on-road driving test. The number of Critical Errors made during the on-road was also recorded. 55 drivers completed the trial (intervention group: 27, control group: 28). Both groups showed reduction in dangerous/hazardous driver errors that required instructor intervention. From baseline to follow-up there was a greater reduction in the number of critical errors made by the intervention group relative to the control group (IRR&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.53, SE&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.1, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;.008). The intervention group improved on the DSR more than the control group (intervention mean change&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.07 SD&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.00, control group mean change&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.32 SD&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.61). The intervention group had 64% remediation of unsafe driving, where drivers who achieved a score of 'fail' at baseline, 'passed' at follow-up. The control group had 25% remediation. Tailored driving lessons reduced the critical driving errors made by older adults. Longer term follow-up and larger trials are required.
