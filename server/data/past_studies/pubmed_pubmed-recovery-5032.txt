Study Title: Incidence and Risk Factors of Ophthalmic Nerve Palsy in Patients With Tuberculous Meningitis: A Retrospective Study and Literature Review.

Study Summary:
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) can lead to ophthalmic nerve palsy (ONP), a severe neurological complication. This study aims to evaluates the incidence and risk factors for ONP in TBM patients. This retrospective study included 250 TBM patients from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (2013-2022). Clinical and imaging data were analyzed, with logistic regression identifying risk factors for ONP. ONP occurred in 6.8% (17/250) of TBM patients. Those with ONP had higher intracranial pressure (ICP) (257.69 &#xb1; 68.12 mmH2O vs 191.65 &#xb1; 91.58 mmH2O;= 0.012), cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, and a higher prevalence of tuberculomas (29.4% vs 10.7%;= 0.039). Logistic regression identified pre-treatment ICP, CD4 percentage, and tuberculomas as significant risk factors. Linezolid use was a protective factor for ONP recovery. Six point eight percent (17/250) of patients with TBM developed ONP as a complication. ICP, CD4 counts, and tuberculomas are key predictors. Linezolid shows potential as a therapeutic agent for improving outcomes in TBM patients with neurological complications, warranting further study.
