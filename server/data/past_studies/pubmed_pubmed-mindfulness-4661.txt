Study Title: Emotion Management for College Students: Effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Emotion Management Intervention on Emotional Regulation and Resilience of College Students.

Study Summary:
The discovery of psychological healing methods that are easy to master and can be developed by the individual as a means of improving students' self-psychological adjustment ability is of great practical value. This study is a randomized control trial intended to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based emotion management interventions and to test their effects on the mood state and resilience of college students. A total of 72 students were recruited and randomly divided into an intervention group and a control group. Thirty-six students in the intervention group received a modified mindfulness-based emotion management intervention once per week for 4 weeks, with each intervention having a duration of 80 minutes. Participants were assessed by questionnaires to measure mindfulness level, emotion, and resilience before and after intervention. There were significant interaction effects on mindfulness level (F = 97.76, p < 0.00), mood state (F = 353.52, p < 0.00), and resilience (F = 178.99, p < 0.00) scores. A modified 4-week mindfulness-based emotion management intervention can improve the mindfulness level and resilience of college students and is an innovative and feasible strategy for enhancing mental health in college students.
