Study Title: Oral Health Recovery: Randomized Evaluation of an Oral-Behavioral Health Integration Approach.

Study Summary:
This study implemented a single-session oral health education and referral program in behavioral health settings serving people with psychiatric disabilities. The program was led by peer specialists ("peers")-lay community behavioral health workers with personal experience of mental health challenges who are trained and certified to support others. Investigators collaborated with peers, state government, and clinical leadership to design and implement the program. Randomized parallel assignment was used to compare 2 arms: (1) group viewing of an oral health educational video (VC) and (2) a peer-led 1-time class providing education and motivation to access dental care (the Oral Health Recovery Group; OHRG). In both arms, peers followed up with participants to encourage accessing dental care and reinforce at-home care goals. Oral health knowledge, at-home care, motivation, appointment scheduling, and utilization were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 2 mo. Qualitative interviews assessed barriers and facilitators. More than half of participants reported oral pain in the previous year. Pre-/postintervention survey results did not significantly improve in either arm or differ between arms. At follow-up, 25 (68%) in OHRG and 14 (56%) in VC reported meeting a dental at-home care goal because of the program. Ten (27%) in OHRG and 9 (36%) in VC reported making a dental appointment because of the program. Most were satisfied with the program. Interviewed participants were comfortable with peers in this role, yet access barriers remained. Single-session oral health interventions were implemented in behavioral health settings. The fact that surveys did not significantly improve suggests that more intensive interventions may be needed. Nevertheless, peers successfully scheduled dental appointments for vulnerable patients. Given that dental appointments were scheduled after only a 1-time class and light-touch peer navigation, oral health integration in behavioral health settings shows promise as a financially sustainable approach that merits further research. The results of this study can be used by staff in behavioral health settings who wish to consider peer-led financially sustainable approaches to providing oral health education and linkages to dental care for their clients.
