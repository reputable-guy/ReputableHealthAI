Study Title: Mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting for pregnant women with high fear of childbirth and their partners: outcomes of a randomized controlled trial assessing short- and longer-term effects on psychological well-being, birth and pregnancy experience.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) reduces mothers' anticipated fear of childbirth (FOC), nonurgent obstetric interventions during childbirth and may improve childbirth outcomes in women with high FOC (Veringa-Skiba et&#xa0;al, 2022). The aim of this study was to examine the short- and longer-term outcomes of MBCP on psychological well-being, pregnancy and birth experience, as compared to enhanced care-as-usual (ECAU), in pregnant women with high FOC and their partners. Participants were randomly assigned to MBCP or ECAU and completed questionnaires preintervention (T1), immediately after intervention (T2), two to four weeks after childbirth (T3) and 16-20 weeks after childbirth (T4). Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. The courses were provided by trained midwives. Participants included 141 pregnant women and 120 partners. MBCP comprised a nine-weekly three-hour session mindfulness group course for pregnant couples; ECAU consisted of two 90-minute individual couple consultation sessions. Measures of psychological well-being included measures like stress, depression, anxiety and fatigue. Measures of pregnancy and birth experience concerned experiencing uplifts during pregnancy, experienced fear of childbirth, labour pain and satisfaction with childbirth. No differences between MBCP and ECAU in the total group of birthing women were found. However, women with (at least an onset of) labour that participated in MBCP reported a better birth experience compared to ECAU at T3. Concerning the total partner group only one difference between MBCP and ECAU was found at T4; MBCP partners reported an increase in fatigue. However, in the partner risk group (i.e., partners with lower psychological well-being before intervention) partners experienced better psychological well-being at T2 and T3 after MBCP than ECAU. MBCP and ECAU demonstrate similar effects on psychological well-being, birth and pregnancy experience. However, MBCP appears superior to ECAU for labouring women in having a better childbirth experience and for partners at risk for psychological complaints in increasing their psychological well-being. MBCP only positively affects the childbirth experience of those who experience (onset of) natural birth. It might be advisable to include partners at risk for psychological complaints in the MBCP.
