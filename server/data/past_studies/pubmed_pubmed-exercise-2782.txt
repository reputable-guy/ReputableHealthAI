Study Title: Effect of Home-Based Cardiac Telerehabilitation in Patients After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Low adherence to hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation has been observed in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention. The effectiveness of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation in this setting is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation on exercise endurance, disease burden status, cardiac function, and quality of life in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention. A total of 106 patients after percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (receiving routine rehabilitation care and home-based cardiac telerehabilitation) or the control group (receiving routine care only), with 53 patients in each group. The 6-minute walking test, anerobic threshold, physical component summary score, mental component summary score, V o2max , and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured in both groups before and 3 months after the intervention. Additionally, the Short-Form 12 scale and Family Burden Interview Schedule were used to assess quality of life and disease burden status. The intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in 6-minute walking test, anerobic threshold, V o2max , physical component summary score, mental component summary score, Short-Form 12 scale, and Family Burden Interview Schedule scale scores compared with the control group ( P <0.05). Results suggest that home-based cardiac telerehabilitation may improve exercise endurance and quality of life and reduce disease burden status in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.
