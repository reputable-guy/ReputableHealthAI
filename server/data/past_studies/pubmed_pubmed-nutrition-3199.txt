Study Title: Anthropometric and sociodemographic variables, but not preconception or prenatal maternal nutrition supplementation, predict neurodevelopment in offspring of the 'Women First'&#xa0;trial.

Study Summary:
Multiple factors influence infant and child neurodevelopment in low resource settings. In offspring of participants in the preconception maternal nutrition trial, Women First&#xa0;(WF), we examined the impact of providing a preconception (Arm 1) or prenatal (Arm 2) nutrient supplement (compared to controls, Arm 3) on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months; predictors of neurodevelopment scores; and associations of infant anthropometrics with neurodevelopmental scores. Follow-up visits for anthropometry were conducted at 6-, 12-, 18-&#xa0;and 24-month&#xa0;of age. At 24-months, in a randomized subset,&#xa0;the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd&#xa0;edition (BSID-III), including cognitive, motor&#xa0;and social-emotional subscales,&#xa0;and the Family Care Indicators (FCI) questionnaire, assessing family and home environment, were completed. Multiple covariates (intervention arm, site, maternal sociodemographic characteristics, FCI subscales, birthweight&#xa0;and 6-24 months'&#xa0;change in anthropometry z-scores, (e.g., &#x394;LAZ) were evaluated by linear regression to predict BSID-III outcomes and to assess associations of anthropometric changes with BSID-III scores. The analysis consisted of 1386 infants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;441, 486, 459 for Arms 1, 2&#xa0;and 3, respectively). None of the domain-specific BSID-III subscale scores differed by maternal intervention arm. Four covariates significantly predicted (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01) all 3 BSID-III subscales: secondary maternal education, &#x394;LAZ, birthweight >2500&#x2009;g, and FCI play materials. Linear growth was associated with all domains of neurodevelopment. The results underscore the multi-dimensional aspects of child development represented by the nurturing care framework, including prenatal maternal nutrition, post-natal growth, maternal education for responsive caregiving&#xa0;and opportunities for early learning.
