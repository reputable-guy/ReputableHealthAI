Study Title: Effect of aerobic and resistive exercise on lipid profile and quality of life in overweight breastfeeding women: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Breastfeeding provides benefits for both mothers and babies. However, many women experience postpartum weight gain, unfavorable lipid profiles, and other postpartum problems that can adversely impact their overall quality of life (QoL). To examine the effect of adding aerobic and resistive exercise to faradic stimulation and nutritional counseling on lipid profile and QoL in overweight breastfeeding women. Fifty-four breastfeeding women were randomly allocated into two equally sized groups. Group A underwent abdominal faradic stimulation along with nutritional counseling for 12&#xa0;weeks, whereas Group B received identical faradic stimulation and nutritional counseling and engaged in a combined aerobic and resistive exercise program for the same duration. Before and after treatment, the following anthropometric measurements were evaluated: body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (W/H); lipid profile analysis, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG); and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). All outcome measures demonstrated significant improvements within the two groups (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Group B showed more significant reductions in BMI, W/H ratio, and LDL, along with greater significant increases in the SF-36 domain scores for physical functioning, physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, energy/fatigue, social activity, mental health, and the total SF-36 score (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) compared to group A post-treatment. However, there were no significant differences in HDL, TG, and the score of the emotional wellbeing domain of the SF-36 between the groups after treatment (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). 12-week aerobic and resistive exercise is effective in reducing the BMI, W/H ratio, and LDL levels and enhancing the QoL in overweight breastfeeding women.
