Study Title: More Than Skin Deep: Patient-Provider Racial and Ethnic Concordance and Discordance in Collegiate Athletics and Concussion Management.

Study Summary:
There is strong evidence that racial and ethnic disparities exist in multiple arenas of health and wellness. The causes of racial and ethnic differences in health care are multidimensional; one factor that may affect injury/illness communication, interactions, and outcomes is patient-provider racial and ethnic concordance. At present, it is unclear what role patient-provider racial and ethnic concordance and discordance plays in facilitating concussion care for collegiate athletes. To investigate the presence of athlete-athletic trainer (AT) racial and ethnic concordance and discordance among diagnosed concussion cases and examine if racial and ethnic concordance and discordance influences time (in days) until diagnosis, symptom resolution, or return-to-sport clinical milestones in collegiate athletes. Retrospective cohort study. Collegiate athletics. A total of 694 concussion cases (38.6% [n = 268] sustained by women, 61.4% [n = 426] sustained by men) that occurred within the 2015-2016 through 2019-2020 sport seasons at 9 institutions. The number of days from the date of injury to diagnosis, symptom resolution, and return to sport and from the date of diagnosis to symptom resolution and return to sport. Overall, 68.4% (n = 475) of concussion cases had patient-provider racial and ethnic concordance, and 31.6% (n = 219) were discordant. All concordant pairs included a White athlete and White AT. Time to diagnosis differed between the concordant and discordant groups (median [interquartile range] = 1 [0-2] versus 0 [0-1], respectively) only in the model adjusted for sex, sport type, and availability of an AT (odds ratio [95% CI] = 1.46 [1.07-1.85]). There were no other group differences. One-third of concussion cases had athlete-AT racial and ethnic discordance. Although this group was diagnosed with a concussion 1 day sooner than the concordant group, no differences were observed for any concussion recovery milestones. These findings suggest that patient-provider racial and ethnic concordance may play a minor role in concussion recognition or reporting but not necessarily in the management and recovery thereafter.
