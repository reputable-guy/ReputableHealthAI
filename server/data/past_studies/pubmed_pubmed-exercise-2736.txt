Study Title: Developing an 8-Week, Tele-Education Weight Control and Exercise Programme, and Evaluating Its Effects on Weight and Pain Reduction in Patients With Obesity and Knee Osteoarthritis: A Double-Blinded Randomised Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability among the elderly and is often exacerbated by obesity. Research supports weight loss and exercise therapy as key strategies for managing knee OA-related disability. Concurrently, telemedicine is becoming a popular healthcare approach. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an 8-week tele-education programme's impact on weight control and knee OA outcomes. Participants with knee OA and obesity were included. Baseline data on pain (VAS index), physical activity (GPAQ questionnaire), and quality of life (EQ5D and KOOS questionnaires) were collected. Performance tests, including the 30-second Chair Stand test (30CST) and the Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG), were recorded. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: a control group receiving oral advice on diet and exercise, and an intervention group receiving educational videos on nutrition, lifestyle changes, physical activity, individualised exercises, and psychosocial support. Evaluations were repeated after 8&#xa0;weeks. Data from 25 of 30 participants were analysed. In the intervention group, body composition, waist, and abdominal circumference decreased significantly (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The KOOS questionnaire showed significant improvements in pain, activity, and daily tasks (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.00). The EQ5D questionnaire and health satisfaction also showed positive results within the intervention group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.00) and between groups (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008). The pain index improved significantly within (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.00) and between groups (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02). Functional test results were significant within the intervention group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.00) and between groups (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.017 for 30CST and p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004 for TUG). An 8-week tele-education programme for weight control and exercise therapy in knee OA patients significantly improved body composition, quality of life, and functional performance. Given the costs of obesity and knee OA on both people and the health system, tele-education can be a cost-effective treatment strategy.
