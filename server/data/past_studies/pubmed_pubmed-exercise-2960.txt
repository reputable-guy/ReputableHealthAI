Study Title: Effects of video-based cervical stabilization home exercises in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a&#xa0;randomized controlled pilot study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to examine the effects of a&#xa0;remote video-based cervical stabilization exercise program on cervical proprioception, functional status, and disease-related quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with RA were evaluated regarding cervical joint positioning error, cervical region functional status (Neck Disability Index), general functional status (Health Assessment Questionnaire), and disease-related quality of life (Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life Scale). Patients were randomized to exercise (n&#x202f;=&#x2009;14, 10&#xa0;female) and control (n&#x202f;=&#x2009;12, 9&#xa0;female) groups. Patients in the exercise group performed a&#xa0;video-based home exercise program consisting of progressive cervical stabilization exercises three times a&#xa0;week for six&#xa0;weeks in addition to their routine medication. The patients in the control group continued their routine medication only. Evaluations were repeated in both groups in the seventh week following the baseline evaluation. Groups were similar at baseline (p&#x202f;>&#x2009;0.05). Patients in both groups had low disease activity (DAS-28 CRP&#x202f;&#x2264;&#x2009;3.2). The remote video-based exercise program led to significant improvements in cervical proprioception, functional status, and disease-related quality of life (p&#x202f;<&#x2009;0.05). No significant changes were detected in any parameters in the control group (p&#x202f;>&#x2009;0.05). Obtained changes were superior in the exercise group compared to the control group (d&#x202f;>&#x2009;1.00, p&#x202f;<&#x2009;0.05). Cervical stabilization exercises may increase cervical proprioception, improve functional status, and enhance disease-related quality of life in patients with RA when administered as a&#xa0;remote program. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04948775 , NCT04948775.
