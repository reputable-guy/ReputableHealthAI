Study Title: Effects of Virtual Reality for Postural Control in Chronic Neck Pain: A Single-Blind, Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of virtual reality (VR) on postural control, posture, and kinesiophobia in patients with chronic neck pain (CNP). Forty-one participants with CNP were randomly allocated to the VR and control groups. The VR group experienced VR with glasses for 20 minutes and then performed motor control (MC) exercises for 20 minutes. The control group received only MC exercises for 40 minutes. Both groups received 18 sessions over 6 weeks. Computerized dynamic posturography outcomes, including sensory organization test (SOT), limits of stability, and unilateral stance tests, gait speed, forward head posture (FHP), shoulder protraction (SP), cervical lordosis angle, kinesiophobia, and exercise compliance were recorded. The VR group had more effects regarding composite equilibrium (Cohen's d = 1.20) of SOT and kinesiophobia (Cohen's d = -0.96), P < .05). Also, the VR group was more effective in exercise compliance (P < .05). Contrary to these results, the control group was more effective in correcting FHP and SP (Cohen's d > 0.7, P < .05). Virtual reality seemed to have an effect on postural control, posture, and kinesiophobia in patients with chronic neck pain.
