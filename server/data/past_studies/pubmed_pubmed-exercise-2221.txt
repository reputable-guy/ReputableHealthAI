Study Title: Clinical Efficacy of Virtual Reality Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVE) for Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To assess whether tai chi assisted by the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), a novel virtual reality (VR) technology, was superior to tai chi alone in managing chronic pain in older adults. CAVE may offer a promising alternative to head-mounted displays in chronic pain treatment. The study was a 12-week, 2-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial implemented in VR and non-VR groups (N&#xa0;= 80, each arm&#xa0;= 40). The VR group underwent an 8-week tai chi program in a 3-wall VR-CAVE with projections of nature scenes and music, whereas the control group received tai chi only. Community-dwelling older adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain were randomized (1:1) to VR and non-VR groups. Participants were assessed at baseline, posttreatment at 8&#xa0;weeks, and 12&#xa0;weeks. The primary outcome was the Brief Pain Inventory severity score at 8&#xa0;weeks, modeled within an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating equations. Participants had a mean age of 65.1 &#xb1; 5.6&#xa0;years, with 78.8% female and mean BPI-pain severity score of 4.4 &#xb1; 1.5. At 8&#xa0;weeks, the VR group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in BPI severity score compared with the non-VR group (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.75, 95% CI&#xa0;-1.48 to&#xa0;-0.03, P&#xa0;= .043), with the effect sustained to 12&#xa0;weeks (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.18, 95% CI&#xa0;-1.90 to&#xa0;-0.46, P&#xa0;= .001). No major adverse events were reported. VR-CAVE tai chi was superior to non-VR tai chi for chronic musculoskeletal pain. Future trials that are longer-term, larger in scale, and include other forms of exercise will further inform VR-CAVE's role in post-acute and long-term rehabilitation.
