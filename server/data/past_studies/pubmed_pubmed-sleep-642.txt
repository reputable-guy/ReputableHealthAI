Study Title: Body weight change during a smoking cessation intervention for individuals with overweight or obesity.

Study Summary:
A more comprehensive understanding of the factors regarding weight control in individuals with overweight or obesity after quitting smoking is needed. The study aimed to analyze the changes of in-treatment variables during a smoking cessation intervention and examine their impact on weight. A total of 120 individuals who smoke with overweight or obesity (M&#xa0;=&#xa0;31.75&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.31; 54.16&#xa0;% female) participated in a cognitive-behavioral therapy for smoking cessation and weight control or the same treatment plus contingency management. Weight, smoking variables (cotinine and continuous abstinence), eating behaviors (appetite, grazing), exercise, and sleep were assessed weekly throughout the treatment. More participants gained weight over time with reduced nicotine use or abstinence. There was a tendency during treatment to increase appetite and exercise time, while grazing episodes and sleeping hours remained stable. Higher baseline weight (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001), greater cotinine reduction (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.021) and time (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.009) were associated with greater weight gain, while more hours of exercise (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.003), no appetite changes (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.003) and diminished appetite (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001) were associated with less gain over the treatment. Both treatment conditions showed similar results in all in-treatment variables. Individuals with overweight and obesity with higher baseline weight and higher baseline cotinine levels during smoking cessation interventions may require special attention to improve weight outcomes. Exercise and appetite regulation may be useful for mitigating weight gain in smoking cessation interventions for individuals with overweight or obesity.
