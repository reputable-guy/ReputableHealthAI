Study Title: Long-term effects of benzodiazepine discontinuation among older adults: potential improvements on depressive symptoms.

Study Summary:
To examine how change in benzodiazepine (BZD) use is linked to changes in depressive symptoms intensity, worry intensity, and sleep quality over 16&#x2009;months. Data come from a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) named the 'Programme d'Aide du Succ&#xe8;s au SEvrage (PASSE-60+)' study (NCT02281175). Seventy-three participants age 60&#x2009;years and older took part in a 4-month discontinuation programme and were assessed four times over 16&#x2009;months. Change in BZD use was defined as the difference in reported mg/day between two assessments. Control variables were RCT discontinuation group; BZD use at T1; and either depressive symptoms, worry intensity, or sleep quality at T1. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to analyse data. In the short term, right after the discontinuation programme, sleep quality worsened with lower BZD use. This link was no longer significant at the 3- and 12-month follow-up. In the long term, depressive symptoms lowered with lower BZD use. No change was found in worry intensity in relation to BZD use at all measurement times. Discontinuation may improve depressive symptoms. Our study also questions the long-term effectiveness of BZD use, since long-term discontinuation was not linked with change in worry intensity and sleep quality.
