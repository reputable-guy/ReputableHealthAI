Study Title: Online occupational therapy group training for mothers of children with feeding problems: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to scrutinize how online occupational therapy group training for mothers influenced their attitudes and stress levels relating to feeding their children and the eating behaviours of the children. The secondary purpose of the study is to evaluate the satisfaction of the participants of this program. Twenty-nine mothers of children aged 3-6&#x2009;years, experiencing feeding issues, were randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group. Feeding problems including selective eating, loss of appetite, and mealtime behaviour problems are prevalent during childhood. Parents play a fundamental role in acquiring knowledge about feeding. Problems in the feeding process may lead to parental stress, feelings of despair, and incorrect attitudes. The mothers in the research group participated in the 4-week training. Results indicated positive effects on both maternal attitudes and their children's eating behaviours (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). No significant change was found in mothers' state and trait anxiety levels (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Participants were asked to score their satisfaction level with the program between 1 and 10, and the average of the scores was 9.78&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.42. This study shows that online group education for mothers can support existing treatments and guide clinicians working with children with feeding problems.
