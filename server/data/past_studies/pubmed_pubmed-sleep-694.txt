Study Title: Acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north on executive function and sleep structure in patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony.

Study Summary:
To observe the efficacy of acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north on executive function, sleep structure and sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony. A total of 100 patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony were randomized into an acupuncture group (50 cases, 1 case dropped out) and a western medication group (50 cases, 2 cases dropped out). Acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north was applied at Baihui (GV 20) and bilateral Shenmen (HT 7), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Shenmai (BL 62), Zhaohai (KI 6), Xinshu (BL 15), Shenshu (BL 23) in the acupuncture group, once a day, 5 days a week. Lorazepam tablet was given orally in the western medication group, 0.5-1 mg a time, once a day. Both groups were treated for 4 weeks. The Stroop color-word test (SCWT) indexes (the time consuming and the correct number of card A, B, C and the Stroop interference effect [SIE]), sleep structure indexes (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], wake after sleep onset [WASO], sleep efficiency [SE], non-rapid eye movement period 1 [N1], non-rapid eye movement period 2 [N2], non-rapid eye movement period 3 [N3], rapid eye movement period [REM]) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score were observed before and after treatment in the two groups. After treatment, the time consuming of card B and C, the time consuming and the correct number of SIE, SL, WASO, N1, N2, as well as the sub-item scores and total score of PSQI were decreased (<0.05,<0.01), the correct number of card A, B and C, TST, SE, N3 and REM were increased (<0.01) compared with those before treatment in the acupuncture group; the time consuming of card C and SIE, the correct number of card A and SIE, TST, SE, REM were increased (<0.05,<0.01), SL, WASO, N1, as well as the sub-item scores of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, daytime function and total score of PSQI were decreased (<0.01) compared with those before treatment in the western medication group. After treatment, in the acupuncture group, the time consuming of card C, the time consuming and the correct number of SIE, N1, N2, as well as the sub-item scores of sleep quality, sleep dysfunction, daytime function and total score of PSQI were lower than those in the western medication group (<0.01), the correct number of card B and C, N3, REM were higher than those in the western medication group (<0.01). Acupuncture for reducing the south to reinforce the north can improve the executive function of patients with chronic insomnia disorder of heart-kidney disharmony, adjust the sleep structure, and improve the night sleep quality and daytime body function.
