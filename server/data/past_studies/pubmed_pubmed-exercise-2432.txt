Study Title: The effect of Qigong exercise on state anxiety levels of inpatients in psychiatric wards: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Qigong is a mind-body exercise that originated in China and is often described as a form of meditation or movement therapy. While the existing literature has investigated the impact of Qigong exercises on trait anxiety in outpatients, there is limited research on their influence on state anxiety in inpatients. This study examined the effect of Qigong exercise on state anxiety levels of inpatients in psychiatric wards. This study was a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Seventy inpatients participated in the study, with 35 in each group. In the intervention group, the STAI-I form was used to assess state anxiety levels before (Test 1) and after (Test 2) a single 40-minute session of Qigong. The mean post-test scores of the intervention group (27.20&#xb1;5.57) were significantly lower than those of the control group (39.72&#xb1;10.84). Additionally, a statistically significant difference was observed between the mean test-1 (38.42&#xb1;9.7) and test-2 scores (27.2 &#xb1; 5.57) within the intervention group. A single 40-minute Qigong exercise session reduced state anxiety levels in psychiatric inpatients and reduced the risk of potential adverse outcomes associated with state anxiety. Practitioners may consider the use of Qigong exercise in the management of state anxiety in clinical practice, when making clinical decisions.
