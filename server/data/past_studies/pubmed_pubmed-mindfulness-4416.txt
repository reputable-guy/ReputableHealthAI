Study Title: Exploring Yoga Behaviors among College Students Based on the Multi-Theory Model (MTM) of Health Behavior Change.

Study Summary:
During college years, perceived stress is the top reported hindrance to well-being and academic success. Data on the acceptance and perceived benefits of yoga among college students are limited. A purposive sample of college students (n = 79) from a course centered on Vinyasa Yoga and Mindfulness Meditation were recruited. Comprehensive yoga journaling data were collected, and a directed content analysis along the constructs of the multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change was utilized. The advantages of yoga that emerged were improved physical performance, reduced perceived stress, acceptance of oneself, better well-being, and improved coping. The identified disadvantages were time commitment, lack of motivation, and other competing interests. Learning through small steps, modifications, and identifying multiple sources of confidence helped build behavioral confidence. Practicing at home or at a yoga studio was a common theme for support in the physical environment. Directing negative emotions into purposes was helpful in maintaining the yoga practice. Sustained commitment to the practice also helped maintain the regular performance of yoga. Finally, social support from family, friends, and instructors was vital for continued practice. The study has important ramifications for the development of survey tools for descriptive studies and designing behavior-change yoga interventions in this target population.
