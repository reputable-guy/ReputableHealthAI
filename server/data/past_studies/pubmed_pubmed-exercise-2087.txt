Study Title: Home-Based Exercise and Self-Management After Lung Cancer Resection: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Patients with lung cancer have poor physical functioning and quality of life. Despite promising outcomes for those who undertake exercise programs, implementation into practice of previously tested hospital-based programs is rare. To evaluate a home-based exercise and self-management program for patients after lung resection. A randomized clinical trial with assessor blinding was conducted among 116 patients undergoing surgery for non-small cell lung cancer from November 23, 2017, to July 31, 2023, at tertiary hospitals in Australia. Patients were followed up for 12 months postoperatively. Patients randomized to the intervention group received a postoperative 3-month home-based exercise and self-management program, supported by weekly physiotherapist-led telephone consultations. Patients randomized to the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was self-reported physical function (30-item European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] score) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included objective measures of physical function and exercise capacity (at 3 and 6 months) and patient-reported outcomes including quality of life (at 3 and 6 months, with some questionnaires completed at 12 months). Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. A total of 1370 patients were screened, with 177 eligible and 116 consented (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [9.6] years; 68 women [58.6%]). Of these 116 patients, 58 were randomized to the intervention and 58 to the control. A total of 103 patients (88.8%) completed assessments at 3 months, 95 (81.9%) at 6 months, and 95 (81.9%) at 12 months. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for self-reported physical function (EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning domain score) at the 3-month primary end point (mean [SD] score, 77.3 [20.9] vs 76.3 [18.8]; mean difference, 1.0 point [95% CI, -6.0 to 8.0 points]). Patients in the intervention group, compared with the control group, had significantly greater exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance: mean difference, 39.7 m [95% CI, 6.8-72.6 m]), global quality of life (mean difference, 7.1 points [95% CI, 0.4-13.8 points]), and exercise self-efficacy (mean difference, 16.0 points [95% CI, 7.0-24.9 points]) at 3 months as well as greater objectively measured physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery score: mean difference, 0.8 points [95% CI, 0.1-1.6 points]), exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance: mean difference, 50.9 m [95% CI, 6.7-95.1 m]), and exercise self-efficacy (mean difference, 10.1 points [95% CI, 1.9-18.2 points]) at 6 months. One minor adverse event and no serious adverse events occurred. In this randomized clinical trial, a postoperative home-based exercise and self-management program did not improve self-reported physical function in patients with lung cancer. However, it did improve other important clinical outcomes. Implementation of this program into lung cancer care should be considered. http://anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12617001283369.
