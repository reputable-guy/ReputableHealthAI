Study Title: Healthy couple, better sleep: Exploring connections and changes in couple relationship education participants.

Study Summary:
Considerable evidence suggests couple relationship education (CRE) programs are effective in improving couples' relationship functioning, yet few studies have examined the implications of CRE programs on indicators of physical health despite substantial research supporting links between relational and physical health. This study utilized a sample of 308 couples randomly assigned to a CRE curriculum to explore the dyadic links between conflict management and self-care skills (emphasized in CRE), stress, and sleep dysfunction concurrently. We prospectively tested whether changes in skills drove changes in sleep dysfunction or vice versa, for both self and partner. Results from a series of structural equation models indicated indirect links for men and women between conflict management and self-care skills and sleep dysfunction through lower stress level at program start. Dyadically, men's and women's better conflict management skills were associated with partners' lower stress, which was in turn associated with partners' lower sleep dysfunction. Men's better self-care skills were linked with partners' lower stress levels, which were linked with partners' lower sleep dysfunction. Tests of dyadic prospective cross-lagged effects among changes in sleep and changes in skills indicated that initial improvements in both partners' sleep predicted improvements in their own conflict management skills 1&#x2009;year later. Initial improvements in women's conflict management skills predicted reduced sleep dysfunction for themselves. Additionally, for both partners, early changes in self-care predicted later reductions in sleep dysfunction. Dyadically, immediate improvements in men's self-care predicted reduced sleep dysfunction for their partner a year later. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
