Study Title: The effects of gaze stability exercises on balance, gait ability, and fall efficacy in patients with chronic stroke: A 2-week follow-up from a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to examine the effect of gaze stability exercises on balance, gait ability, and fall efficacy in patients with chronic stroke, as well as to investigate whether any observed effects were maintained 2 weeks later. In this experiment, 30 chronic stroke patients were selected. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups (10 patients in each group). All patients in the 3 groups performed basic neurodevelopmental treatment. Group 1 performed balance exercises accompanied by gaze stability exercises. Group 2 performed gaze stability exercises, and group 3 performed balance exercises. Each exercise program for 40 minutes 3 times a week for 4 weeks. After the intervention period, the patient's balance, gait ability, and fall efficacy were measured again. In order to know whether the training effect is maintained, a 2-week follow-up test was conducted after the training. The results of this study showed that there was a significant improve in balance (overall stability index, limit of stability test, and Berg Balance Scale), gait ability (gait velocity, cadence, step time and step length, Timed Up and Go [TUG] test), and fall efficacy over the different time within the 3 groups. The effect was observed to be maintained in follow-up tests after 2 weeks. In the comparison among 3 groups, the overall stability index, limit of stability test in the balance test and the gait velocity, cadence, step time, step length and Timed Up and Go test in the gait test all showed statistically significant differences, and the other items did not have significant differences. In most of the assessments, group 1 that used balance exercise combined with gaze stability exercise showed a better improvement than the other 2 groups. As a result, for stroke patients, gaze stability exercise is an effective arbitration method to improve balance and gait ability and fall efficacy. With balance exercise combined with gaze stability exercise, a greater effect can be seen than with gaze stability exercise or balance exercise alone. Thus, this combination exercise program can be recommended as effective.
