Study Title: [The structure of post/long COVID fatigue syndrome. Prospects for correction].

Study Summary:
To study the features of post-COVID asthenic syndrome and evaluate the effectiveness of the drug containing the succinic acid complex with trimethylhydrazinium in its treatment. A prospective, multicenter, comparative, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of sequential therapy with BRAINMAXincluded 160 patients with a history of coronavirus infection within 12 to 16 weeks (not more than 12 months). The study was conducted at 6 healthcare centers in different regions of the Russian Federation. Testing was performed on the following scores: VAS for headache score, MFI-20 asthenia score, PSQI test, FAS-10 fatigue score, DHI dizziness score, MoCA cognitive impairment score, Beck anxiety score, vegetative index of Kerdo. PSQI questionnaire showed significant improvement in sleep quality in the study group: by -2.5 points [-4; -1] (<0.001); there was a more pronounced significant decrease in the MFI-20 score of -19.5 points [-27; -11] (<0.001); a significant decrease in the FAS-10 fatigue score by -9 [-13.5; -4] points (<0.001); DHI dizziness score showed a decrease by -6 [-12; 0] points in the BRAINMAXgroup (=0.001); the score of Beck anxiety and depression scale decreased by -5 [-11; -2] points (<0.001). Multiple linear regression data showed a significant increase of 0.56 (=0.02) in the MoCA score. Our study convincingly showed the effectiveness of therapy with BRAINMAXin a wide range of symptoms in patients with the post-COVID syndrome.
