Study Title: Long-term pain outcomes after serial lidocaine infusion in participants with recent onset of peripheral neuropathic pain: A pilot double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the outcomes up to 12 weeks after serial lidocaine infusion for early-onset peripheral neuropathic pain. This pilot double-blind, randomized, 2-arm placebo-controlled trial recruited 50 participants with onset of peripheral neuropathic pain within the past 6 months and randomized them to either receive lidocaine (3&#x2009;mg/kg) in normal saline (50&#x2009;mL) intravenous infusion over 1 hour (lidocaine group) once a week for 4 weeks or 50&#x2009;mL of normal saline infusion (placebo group) once a week for 4 weeks. Twenty-nine participants completed the protocol; 15 participants were assigned to the lidocaine group and 14 to the placebo group. The outcomes were pain intensity assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS), quality of life assessed using EuroQol-Five Dimensions-Five Levels questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), psychological function using the Thai version of the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), pain medication use, and adverse effects, all assessed at baseline (BL) and again at 4, 8, and 12 weeks following randomization. The reported tramadol use at 8 and 12 weeks following the first infusion was significantly lower in the lidocaine group (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.023). No other significant between-group differences were observed at any time point or for any other outcome, and no serious adverse events were observed. Multiple lidocaine infusions of 3&#x2009;mg/kg once a week for 4 weeks in participants with recent onset of peripheral neuropathic pain demonstrated no significant benefits in pain intensity, quality of life, or psychological outcomes. At most, this treatment may result in less tramadol use.
