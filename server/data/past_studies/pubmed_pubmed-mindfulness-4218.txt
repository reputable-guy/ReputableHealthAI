Study Title: Effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction on acute central serous chorioretinopathy: a randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on the structural and functional outcomes of patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). This study included 60 patients with CSCR who were randomly allocated to one of two groups: MBSR or control (which did not practice MBSR). These groups were then evaluated in terms of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) at months 1, 3, and 6. There were no significant differences in BCVA or mean CMT between the groups at the beginning of the study (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.615 and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.561, respectively). There were statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of BCVA at 1, 3, and 6&#xa0;months (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002, respectively). There were also significant differences in the mean CMT across the groups at the first, third, and sixth months (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, and p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, respectively). MBSR may have beneficial outcomes in the early treatment of patients with CSCR, resulting in faster resolution of subretinal fluid and enhancement of BCVA.
