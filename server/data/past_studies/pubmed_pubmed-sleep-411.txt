Study Title: Dose-response of daridorexant in insomnia disorder: An analysis of Phase 2 and 3 studies.

Study Summary:
Daridorexant is approved for the treatment of insomnia at two dose levels (25 and 50&#xa0;mg). Dose-efficacy and -safety response relationships were evaluated using Phase 2 and 3 data. Data (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;2153) from one Phase 2 (daridorexant 5, 10, 25, 50&#xa0;mg, placebo once daily for 1 month) and two Phase 3 studies (daridorexant 10 and 25 or 25 and 50&#xa0;mg, placebo once daily for 3 months) were pooled. Dose-response analyses at 1 month of double-blind treatment were performed using a linear regression and a two-stage meta-analysis approach. Efficacy endpoints were polysomnography-derived wake after sleep onset, latency to persistent sleep (LPS), self-reported total sleep time and the Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire total score (only Phase 3 data for the latter). Safety endpoints were the incidence of total adverse events (AEs) and AEs corresponding to somnolence/fatigue. Dose-responses for all efficacy endpoints were significant in the observed dose range (both statistical approaches, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). All dose-response relationships were linear except for LPS (two-stage meta-analysis) which showed a change in slope above 10&#xa0;mg without reaching a plateau. No significant dose-response was observed for any AE (both approaches, p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). The incidence of AEs corresponding to somnolence/fatigue was low at all doses and, without linear assumption (two-stage meta-analysis) there was no dose-dependency (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.369). The data support the use of 50&#xa0;mg as the preferred daridorexant dose in patients with insomnia disorder to provide the greatest opportunity for efficacy with no increased risk for AEs, including somnolence/fatigue, compared to lower doses.
