Study Title: Electroacupuncture alters brain network functional connectivity in subacute stroke: A randomised crossover trial.

Study Summary:
Electroacupuncture (EA) is a promising rehabilitation treatment for upper-limb motor recovery in stroke patients. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying its clinical efficacy remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the immediate modulatory effects of EA on brain network functional connectivity and topological properties. The randomized, single-blinded, self-controlled two-period crossover trial was conducted among 52 patients with subacute subcortical stroke. These patients were randomly allocated to receive either EA as the initial intervention or sham electroacupuncture (SEA) as the initial intervention. After a washout period of 24 hours, participants underwent the alternate intervention (SEA or EA). Resting state electroencephalography signals were recorded synchronously throughout both phases of the intervention. The functional connectivity (FC) of the parietofrontal network and small-world (SW) property indices of the whole-brain network were compared across the entire course of the two interventions. The results demonstrated that EA significantly altered ipsilesional parietofrontal network connectivity in the alpha and beta bands (alpha: F&#x2005;=&#x2005;5.05, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.011; beta: F&#x2005;=&#x2005;3.295, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.047), whereas no significant changes were observed in the SEA group. When comparing between groups, EA significantly downregulated ipsilesional parietofrontal network connectivity in both the alpha and beta bands during stimulation (alpha: t&#x2005;=&#x2005;-1.998, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.049; beta: t&#x2005;=&#x2005;-2.342, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.022). Significant differences were also observed in the main effects of time and the group&#x2005;&#xd7;&#x2005;time interaction for the SW index (time: F&#x2005;=&#x2005;5.516, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.026; group&#x2005;&#xd7;&#x2005;time: F&#x2005;=&#x2005;6.892, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.01). In terms of between-group comparisons, the EA group exhibited a significantly higher SW index than the SEA group at the post-stimulation stage (t&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.379, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.018). These findings suggest that EA downregulates ipsilesional parietofrontal network connectivity and enhances SW properties, providing a potential neurophysiological mechanism for facilitating motor performance in stroke patients.
