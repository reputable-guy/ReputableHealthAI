Study Title: Functional Outcomes of Immediate Weightbearing After Arthroscopic Lateral Ankle Ligament Repair: A Prospective Randomized Single-Center Trial.

Study Summary:
Previous studies have revealed that early postoperative rehabilitation of chronic lateral ankle instability is just as crucial as surgical intervention. Immediate weightbearing has yielded good clinical results; however, randomized controlled studies have been limited. To compare the clinical outcomes of patients with immediate weightbearing after lateral ankle ligament repair with those with delayed weightbearing after 2 weeks in a prospective randomized controlled study. Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1. Patients who underwent arthroscopic anterior talofibular ligament repair between August 2021 and December 2022 were randomized into 2 groups-immediate weightbearing with a hard ankle brace and nonweightbearing casting for 2 weeks followed by cast removal and weightbearing. Primary outcomes were the ankle function scores as assessed using the visual analog scale at rest and during activities, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and the Karlsson Ankle Functional Score (Karlsson score). Secondary outcomes were the time to return to unsupported walking, jogging, work, and exercise and change in the ankle range of motion (ROM) at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. A total of 88 participants were included, consisting of 58 men and 30 women, with a mean age of 30.26 years. Computerized randomization resulted in 44 patients per group. These 2 groups displayed no difference in the AOFAS score, Karlsson score, and ankle ROM at all follow-ups. Patients who underwent immediate weightbearing had a significantly shorter time of returning to unsupported walking (< .001). No differences were observed in the time of returning to work, jogging, and sports exercise. For patients with chronic ankle instability after arthroscopic anterior talofibular ligament repair, immediate weightbearing allowed patients to return to unsupported walking more quickly and had no negative effects on the AOFAS score, Karlsson score, times of returning to normal life, jogging, sports exercise, and ankle ROM at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups compared with cast fixation.
