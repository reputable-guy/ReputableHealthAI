Study Title: Development of a Wellness Program for Caregivers of Children with Autism.

Study Summary:
Many caregivers of autistic children experience increased stress, and diminished health often due to the caregiving demands.The project aim was to design a feasible and sustainable wellness program tailored to these caregivers' lives.In this collaborative research-informed project, participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;28) were mostly female, white, and well-educated. In focus groups, we delineated lifestyle issues, then designed, delivered and assessed an initial program with one cohort; and repeated this process with a second group.Focus group data were transcribed then coded qualitatively to inform following steps. Data analysis identified lifestyle issues key to program design, desired program elements, and after program delivery, affirmed elements and recommended changes. The team used meta-inferences to guide program revisions after each cohort.Caregivers viewed resultingprogram as filling a significant service gap; its hybrid design used in-person coaching and a habit-building app with mindfulness content to support lifestyle change.
