Study Title: Online photography intervention reduces internet addiction during COVID-19: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated concerns regarding internet addiction. This study investigated the impact of an online photograph intervention on internet addiction and identified its effectiveness mechanisms. Individuals diagnosed with internet addiction (internet addiction test score&#x2009;>&#x2009;36, M&#x2009;=&#x2009;22.85, 78.6% women) were randomly allocated to either the intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;64) or control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;81) groups. For 10&#x2009;days, the intervention group was tasked with photographing "things that make you feel a sense of control in life" and writing 100-word descriptions explaining the reason for the sense of control elicited by the image. Meanwhile, the control group participated only in the assessments. Assessments were conducted before the intervention, immediately afterward and 7&#x2009;days later. A significant interaction between group and time was observed, with the intervention group showing a notable reduction in internet addiction and an increase in sense of control. The sense of control at post-test significantly mediated the intervention's effect on reducing internet addiction at follow-up, but only among individuals with high perceived social support. The findings indicate that online photography interventions can effectively diminish internet addiction, with a sense of control acting as a potent mechanism for intervention, particularly in individuals with substantial perceived social support.
