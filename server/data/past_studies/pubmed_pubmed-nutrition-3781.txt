Study Title: Effect of nutrition intervention on cognitive development among malnourished preschool children: randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Childhood malnutrition impairs health, development, and productivity in adulthood. Underweight children have been found to have a variety of cognitive abnormalities. The present study examined the effect of a nutrition-focused intervention on cognitive development among malnourished preschool children between 3 and 5&#xa0;years of age residing in selected villages of Udupi district, Karnataka. A cluster of 12 villages was chosen randomly. The trial had&#xa0;enrolled preschool children (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;253)&#xa0;from randomly assigned selected villages to intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;127) and control arms (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;126). The mothers in the intervention arm received nutrition-focused intervention and reinforcement of health teaching for 12&#xa0;months. The post-intervention outcome on the cognitive development of malnourished children was measured at 6&#xa0;months and 12&#xa0;months. Statistical analyses indicated that 52% of children in the intervention group had average cognitive development scores on the pre-test, whereas on the post-test, only 5.5% were in the average level of cognitive development. In the control group, the average cognitive development status of the children decreased from 44.4% in the pretest to 26.2% in the post-test. The cognitive development of malnourished children in the intervention group improved compared to the control group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). This study revealed that home-based nutrition-focused food helps to enhance children's cognitive development.Trial registration: ctri@gov.in. CTRI/31/03/2017/008273 [Registered on: 31/03/2017].
