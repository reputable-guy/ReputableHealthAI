Study Title: The influence of traditional Thai massage on recovery from gastrocnemius muscle fatigue: A single-blind randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To determine the effects of traditional Thai massage (TTM) on improving fatigue recovery and fatigue-related parameters of the gastrocnemius muscle after a heel-raise exercise. A single-blind randomised controlled trial. Mae Fah Luang University Hospital, Thailand. Fifty-four healthy participants were randomly assigned to two groups: TTM (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27; 51.85&#xa0;% women; mean age 23.15&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.90 years; number of exercises/week: 4.78&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.58) and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27; 59.26&#xa0;% women; mean age 22.63&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.88 years; number of exercises/week: 4.48&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.25). After the participants performed a heel-raise exercise to induce fatigue of the gastrocnemius muscle, they received either 30&#xa0;min of TTM to the gastrocnemius muscle or 30&#xa0;min of control (29&#xa0;min of rest and 1&#xa0;min total gastrocnemius stretching). The outcome measures were the median frequency (MDF) of the electromyography signal, muscle power (MP) and feelings of muscle fatigue (FMF). All the outcome measures were evaluated before (T1) and after (T2) the fatigue-inducement protocol as well as immediately (T3), 1&#xa0;h (T4) and 2&#xa0;h (T5) after the interventions. The results show that MDF and MP were significantly increased and FMF significantly decreased in both groups immediately after the interventions and at 1&#xa0;h and 2&#xa0;h after the interventions (repeated measures ANOVA: p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05). In the between-group comparisons, participants in the TTM group showed significantly greater improvement than those in the control group on all outcomes at all post-intervention assessment time points (T3, T4, T5), reflecting faster recovery from muscle fatigue (ANCOVA: p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05). TTM proved an effective intervention for maximising recovery from fatigue of the gastrocnemius muscle.
