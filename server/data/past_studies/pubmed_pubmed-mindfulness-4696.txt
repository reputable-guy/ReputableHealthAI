Study Title: Investigating the impact of modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on occupational burnout and other mental health status among nonmedical staff in a hospital: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Burnout is a prolonged psychological response to a longstanding interpersonal stressor at work. It can progress to other mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. In today's society, burnout has become widespread, and it is currently a serious challenge in health systems. This study intended to investigate the impact of mindfulness training on burnout and depression, anxiety, and stress of nonmedical staff in a hospital in Shiraz-Iran. Fifty nonmedical staff in a Shiraz-Iran hospital were enrolled in this two groups' randomized controlled trial. The intervention group was trained by a modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program, and the control group received no intervention. The outcome was assessed by the Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI) and DASS-21 questionnaire on three occasions including before T0, immediately after T1, and 3&#xa0;months after the intervention T2. Comparing the score changes between intervention and control groups showed that the reduction of work&#x2011;distaste&#x2011;related burnout, client&#x2011;related burnout, anxiety, and stress scores in the intervention group was significantly more than in the control group in the time interval from T0 to T1. The scores in the intervention group in three subscales of CBI, including work&#x2011;characteristic&#x2011;related burnout, work&#x2011;distaste&#x2011;related burnout, and client&#x2011;related burnout, decreased significantly immediately after the training (T1) compared to before (T0). Also, the scores did not change significantly after 3&#xa0;months following training. Mindfulness training can be used as an effective way to improve occupational burnout, anxiety, and stress in occupations other than health professionals. Its effect is stable for at least a few months. It is recommended that future studies focus on investigating the feasible way to integrate this training into the working environment. Forthcoming studies should also determine whether the impact of this intervention will last longer and find possible ways to extend its influence.
