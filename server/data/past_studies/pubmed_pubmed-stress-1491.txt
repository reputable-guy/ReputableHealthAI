Study Title: Multivitamin Compliance Reduces Injuries of Female Recruits at Air Force Basic Training: A Randomized Controlled Cohort Study.

Study Summary:
Department of the Air Force basic military training (BMT) is the 7.5-week initial entry training for all enlisting U.S. Air Force and Space Force recruits. Overuse musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) during training threaten success in BMT, and trainees with nutritional deficiencies are at higher risk. Several efforts are made at BMT to mitigate these issues to help trainees graduate on time, such as the distribution of multivitamins (MVI) to female recruits. However, trainee compliance with the prescribed MVI has been reported to be low, calling into question the effectiveness of this intervention. This study evaluated the effect of briefing modality offered to these trainees at the time of distribution on educational effectiveness, MVI compliance, and injury rates. This was a randomized controlled cohort study of BMT female trainees. Subjects included all female trainees of a single iteration of BMT concurrently completing training within the same squadron. At the outset of training, cohorts were randomly educated in one of two ways regarding the provided MVI. The control cohort (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;80) was presented with the standard educational video created by BMT-registered dietitians, while the test cohort (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;79) was presented the video and then also briefed in-person by a group of subject matter experts. At the end of BMT, the trainees completed a questionnaire regarding their knowledge, confidence, and compliance with the MVI. Additionally, a routinely collected training database was queried and analyzed for differences in injuries and training outcomes using the chi-squared test with significance set to &#x3b1;&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05. Although both cohorts found their educational presentation useful, the "in-person" cohort reported significantly higher compliance rates and were found to be diagnosed with MSKI and bone stress injuries at significantly lower rates (43% and 66% relative risk reductions, respectively). Education to female BMT trainees regarding the MVI, which included a face-to-face discussion with subject matter experts, resulted in greater compliance and reduced incidence of MSKI and bone stress injury, compared to a video prepared by registered dietitians alone. Such educational approaches should continue to be strived for in this and other military population health measures. This study's implication of MVI efficacy for injury risk reduction in female trainees should be further studied, verified, and improved upon in this and other populations.
