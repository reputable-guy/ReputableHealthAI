Study Title: Multimodal prehabilitation to enhance functional capacity of patients with esophageal cancer during concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapies-a randomized feasibility trial.

Study Summary:
Esophageal adenocarcinoma continues to bear high morbidity and mortality. Prehabilitation, using exercise, nutrition, and psychosocial strategies to optimize patients prior to surgical resection, is largely underexplored in this malignancy, especially in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Objectives of this study were (i) to determine feasibility of prehabilitation during treatment in patients with esophageal cancer and (ii) to establish differences between hospital and home-based exercise. Patients were recruited from August 2019 - February 2023 and blindly randomized to either supervised or homebased exercise, receiving identical nutritional and psychosocial support. The main outcome measures were recruitment, retention, and dropout rates. The secondary outcomes included cardiorespiratory fitness, functional capacity, and quality of life. Forty-four subjects were blindly randomized: 23 to supervised exercise and 21 to home-based exercise (72% recruitment rate). Overall compliance for the supervised group was 72%; home-based group was 77%. Baseline to pre-operative, both groups experienced significant increases in sit-to-stand, arm curls, and amount of weekly moderate-vigorous physical activity. The home-based group experienced an additional considerable decrease in up-and-go test times. Both groups maintained cardiorespiratory fitness and saw substantial increases in some quality-of-life scores. Multimodal prehabilitation is feasible for patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In both groups, patient fitness, which is relevant for this patient population given the anticipated decline in functional status during this period, was maintained. This study provides a foundation for future prehabilitation interventions in this patient population.
