Study Title: L-Citrulline Supplementation Improves Arterial Blood Flow and Muscle Oxygenation during Handgrip Exercise in Hypertensive Postmenopausal Women.

Study Summary:
Endothelial dysfunction decreases exercise limb blood flow (BF) and muscle oxygenation. Acute L-Citrulline supplementation (CIT) improves muscle tissue oxygen saturation index (TSI) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) during exercise. Although CIT improves endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) in hypertensive women, the impact of CIT on exercise BF and muscle oxygenation (TSI) and extraction (HHb) are unknown. We examined the effects of CIT (10 g/day) and a placebo for 4 weeks on blood pressure (BP), arterial vasodilation (FMD, BF, and vascular conductance [VC]), and forearm muscle oxygenation (TSI and HHb) at rest and during exercise in 22 hypertensive postmenopausal women. Compared to the placebo, CIT significantly (< 0.05) increased FMD (&#x394;-0.7 &#xb1; 0.6% vs. &#x394;1.6 &#xb1; 0.7%) and reduced aortic systolic BP (&#x394;3 &#xb1; 5 vs. &#x394;-4 &#xb1; 6 mmHg) at rest and improved exercise BF (&#x394;17 &#xb1; 12 vs. &#x394;48 &#xb1; 16 mL/min), VC (&#x394;-21 &#xb1; 9 vs. &#x394;41 &#xb1; 14 mL/mmHg/min), TSI (&#x394;-0.84 &#xb1; 0.58% vs. &#x394;1.61 &#xb1; 0.46%), and HHb (&#x394;1.03 &#xb1; 0.69 vs. &#x394;-2.76 &#xb1; 0.77 &#x3bc;M). Exercise BF and VC were positively correlated with improved FMD and TSI during exercise (all< 0.05). CIT improved exercise artery vasodilation and muscle oxygenation via increased endothelial function in hypertensive postmenopausal women.
