Study Title: The OMNIVEG STUDY: Health outcomes of shifting from a traditional to a vegan Mediterranean diet in healthy men. A&#xa0;controlled crossover trial.

Study Summary:
The Mediterranean diet is a plant-based dietary pattern with well-established health benefits such as the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, incorporating more plant-based foods into a Mediterranean diet may provide further health benefits. The study aimed to assess the effect of shifting from a traditional Mediterranean diet to a vegan Mediterranean diet on cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profile in physically active and healthy men. Participants underwent a baseline period with adhesion to the general patterns of the Mediterranean diet for three weeks and then they changed to an isocaloric vegan version of the Mediterranean diet for four weeks, with a 7-day washout period between diets. The shift from the traditional Mediterranean diet to the vegan Mediterranean diet required substituting animal-based foods with plant-based foods that contain comparable amounts of protein and fat. Fourteen participants with a mean age of 24.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7.0 years (range: 18-37 years), completed the study protocol. The change from the traditional to the vegan Mediterranean diet reduced blood concentration of total cholesterol (-22.6&#xa0;mg/dl, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01, Effect size [ES]&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.07) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-12.8&#xa0;mg/dl, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01, ES&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.72). An inverse correlation was observed between the intake of dietary fibre and LDL-C (partial rho&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.43, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.040). The adoption of a vegan Mediterranean diet with plant-based proteins and fats instead of the traditional Mediterranean diet improved several cardiometabolic health outcomes in physically active and healthy men.
