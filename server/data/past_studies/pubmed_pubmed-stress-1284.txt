Study Title: The Effectiveness of a Parent Empowerment Intervention for Caregivers of Children with Cystic Fibrosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This paper focused on the effectiveness of a parent empowerment intervention based on nursing education (PEINE). This study examined whether the intervention improved the quality of life of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and improved their caregivers learn about the disease and develop problem-solving and coping skills. This randomized-controlled trial used a pretest-posttest parallel-group research design. The sample consisted of 48 parents (caregivers) of children with CF. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (= 24) and a control group (= 24). The intervention group received PEINE and standard care and treatment for ten weeks. The control group received standard care and treatment. Data were collected using a Disease Information Survey (DIS), the Ways of Coping Inventory (WCI), the Problem-Solving Inventory (PSI), and the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R). After the intervention, the intervention group DIS scores (d: 1,627 [CI: 0.934,2.305], had more correct answers than the control group. Nursing interventions were effective (< .001). There was no significant difference in the mean pretest-posttest PSI scores (d: 0.378 [CI: -0.221-0.972], posttest WCI scores (d: 0.239 [CI:-0.356-0.831]) between the intervention and control groups (>.05). There was a significant difference in the mean posttest CFQ-R scores between the intervention and control groups (d: 1.363 [CI: l.698, 2.015]);(< .001). PEINE increased the intervention group participants develop disease-management skills. However, the increase in their PSI and WCI scores was statistically insignificant. PEINE also increased the quality of life of children with CF. Parents of children followed in pediatric pulmonary diseases participated in the study. Parents were informed during outpatient clinic visits. After the first meeting, the children and parents who voluntarily agreed to participate in the research were contacted by phone. The outpatient nurse assisted in communicating with children and parents.
