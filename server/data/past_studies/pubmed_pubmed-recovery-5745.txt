Study Title: The analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided cervical erector spinae block in arthroscopic shoulder surgery: a randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a novel fascial plane block technique that can provide effective perioperative analgesia for thoracic, abdominal and lumbar surgeries. However, the effect of cervical ESPB on postoperative analgesia after arthroscopic shoulder surgery is unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the analgesic effect and safety of ultrasound-guided cervical ESPB in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Seventy patients undergoing arthroscopy shoulder surgery were randomly assigned to one of two groups: ESPB group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;35) or control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;35). Patients in the ESPB group received an ultrasound-guided ESPB at the C7 level with 30 mL of 0.25% ropivacaine 30&#xa0;min before induction of general anesthesia, whereas patients in the control group received no block. The primary outcome measures were the static visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores at 4, 12, and 24&#xa0;h after surgery. Secondary outcomes included heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) before anesthesia (t1), 5&#xa0;min after anesthesia (t2), 10&#xa0;min after skin incision (t3), and 10&#xa0;min after extubation (t4); intraoperative remifentanil consumption; the Bruggrmann comfort scale (BCS) score, quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) scale score and the number of patients who required rescue analgesia 24&#xa0;h after surgery; and adverse events. The static VAS scores at 4, 12 and 24&#xa0;h after surgery were significantly lower in the ESPB group than those in the control group (2.17&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.71 vs. 3.14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.19, 1.77&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.77 vs. 2.63&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.84, 0.74&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.66 vs. 1.14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.88, all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There were no significant differences in HR or MAP at any time point during the perioperative period between the two groups (all P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The intraoperative consumption of remifentanil was significantly less in the ESPB group compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The scores of BCS and QoR-15 scale were higher in the ESPB group 24&#xa0;h after surgery than those in the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Compared to the control group, fewer patients in the ESPB group required rescue analgesia 24&#xa0;h after surgery (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). No serious complications occurred in either group. Ultrasound-guided cervical ESPB can provide effective postoperative analgesia following arthroscopic shoulder surgery, resulting in a better postoperative recovery with fewer complications.
