Study Title: Objectifying the classroom: Examining self-objectification and its effects on cognitive resources within virtual class environments.

Study Summary:
Videoconferencing platforms (i.e., Zoom) allow for continuous appearance monitoring via the self-view setting - raising concerns about self-objectification. Prior research indicates that self-objectification is associated with diminished cognitive performance, which may affect learning. This experiment examined how videoconferencing camera settings affect body image and cognitive performance. Female college students (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;167) participated in a Zoom call with various camera settings: camera with self-view (i.e., others could see them and they could see themselves on screen), camera without self-view (i.e., others on the call could see them, but they could not see themselves), and camera off. After random assignment to condition, participants completed a collaborative exercise, answered questions related to self-objectification and body anxiety, and took a math test. Camera settings had no effect on state self-objectification or appearance anxiety. Participants in the camera without self-view condition demonstrated worse performance on the math test than those who had their cameras off, but no other pairwise comparisons were significant. Surprisingly, high trait self-objectifiers were not more sensitive to self-view camera exposure, though high trait self-objectification was associated with greater appearance anxiety across conditions. State self-objectification did not predict cognitive performance. Still, findings demonstrate a meaningful effect of camera settings on cognitive performance.
