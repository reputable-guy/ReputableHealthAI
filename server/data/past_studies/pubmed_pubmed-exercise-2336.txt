Study Title: A 12-week in-phase bilateral upper limb exercise protocol promoted neuroplastic and clinical changes in people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis: A registered report randomized single-case concurrent multiple baseline study.

Study Summary:
Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis manifests various motor symptoms including impairments in corticospinal tract integrity, whose symptoms can be assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Several factors, such as exercise and interlimb coordination, can influence the plastic changes in corticospinal tract. Previous work in healthy and chronic stroke survivors showed that the greatest improvement in corticospinal plasticity occurred during in-phase bilateral exercises of the upper limbs. Altered corticospinal plasticity due to bilateral lesions in the central nervous system is common after Multiple Sclerosis, yet the effect of in-phase bilateral exercise on the bilateral corticospinal plasticity in this cohort remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate the effects of in-phase bilateral exercises on central motor conduction time, motor evoked potential amplitude and latency, motor threshold and clinical measures in people with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. Five people were randomized and recruited in this single case concurrent multiple baseline design study. The intervention protocol lasted for 12 consecutive weeks (30-60 minutes /session x 3 sessions / week) and included in-phase bilateral upper limb movements, adapted to different sports activities and to functional motor training. To define the functional relation between the intervention and the results, we conducted a visual analysis. If a potential sizeable effect was observed, we subsequently performed a statistical analysis. Results demonstrated bilateral reduction of the motor threshold alongside with improvement of all clinical measures, but not in any other corticospinal plasticity measures. Our preliminary findings suggest that in-phase bilateral exercise affects motor threshold in people with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. Therefore, this measure could potentially serve as a proxy for detecting corticospinal plasticity in this cohort. However, future studies with larger sample sizes should validate and potentially establish the effect of in-phase bilateral exercise on the corticospinal plasticity and clinical measures in this cohort.
