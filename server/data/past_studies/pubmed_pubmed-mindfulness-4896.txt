Study Title: Evaluation of a Brief Mindfulness Intervention on Examination Anxiety and Stress.

Study Summary:
Nursing students report increasing levels of stress and anxiety related to academic performance. Mindfulness programs have been found to reduce stress, yet such programs have been identified as a time-burden for students. This study evaluated the integration of a brief preexamination mindfulness reflective intervention for nursing students. Perceived stress, anxiety, resilience, and acceptability were evaluated. A mixed-methods experimental design with random assignment was used. Forty-nine nursing students were randomized to either an intervention group (= 25) who participated in the brief preexamination mindfulness intervention or a control group (= 24) who took their examinations without any intervention. Self-report tools measured stress, resilience, and mindfulness. Qualitative responses were collected. Outcomes revealed decreased feelings of helplessness and anxiety in the intervention group. Although students had positive views of mindfulness, barriers were indicated. Brief preexamination mindfulness interventions provide students with anxiety-reducing options..
