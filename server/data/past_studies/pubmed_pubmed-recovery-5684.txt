Study Title: ACE gene polymorphisms (rs4340) II and DI are more responsive to the ergogenic effect of caffeine than DD on aerobic power, heart rate, and perceived exertion in a homogeneous Brazilian group of adolescent athletes.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to verify the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes DD, DI, and II and caffeine (CAF) ingestion on endurance performance, heart rate, ratio of perceived exertion (RPE), and habitual caffeine intake (HCI) of adolescent athletes. Seventy-four male adolescent athletes (age: DD=16&#xb1;1.7; DI=16&#xb1;2.0; II=15&#xb1;1.7 years) ingested CAF (6 mg/kg) or placebo (PLA) one hour before performing the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) test. No difference was found among groups for HCI. However, CAF increased the maximal distance covered and VO2max in DI and II genotype carriers compared to PLA (DD: &#x394;=31 m and 0.3 mL&#xb7;kg-1&#xb7;min-1; DI: &#x394;=286 m and 1.1 mL&#xb7;kg-1&#xb7;min-1; II: &#x394;=160 m and 1.4 mL&#xb7;kg-1&#xb7;min-1). Heart rate of DI and II genotype carriers increased with CAF compared to PLA, while RPE was higher in the II and lower in the DD genotypes. The correlations between HCI and maximal distance covered or VO2max were significant in the II genotype carriers with CAF. CAF increased endurance capacity, heart rate, and RPE in adolescent athletes with allele I, while endurance performance and aerobic power had a positive correlation to HCI in the II genotype group. These findings suggested that DD genotype were less responsive to CAF and that genetic variations should be taken into account when using CAF supplementation to enhance exercise performance.
