Study Title: Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor on atrial high-rate episodes in patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic device: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Prior research has demonstrated an association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and a reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). Given the established link between mitochondrial dysfunction and AF, this study aimed to explore the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on AF burden and plausible antiarrhythmic mechanisms in patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Patients with atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) detected by CIEDs were randomized to receive either 10&#xa0;mg of dapagliflozin or a placebo for 3 months. AF burdens were quantified via CIEDs interrogations as AHREs duration, percentage, and number of episodes at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Mitochondrial parameters, cellular oxidative stress, and norepinephrine levels were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A total of 54 patients with CIEDs were enrolled in the study. Among them, 36 patients (66.7%) had a history of clinical AF, and 9 patients (16.7%) had diabetes mellitus. After 3 months of the assigned treatment, the median longest AHRE duration decreased similarly in both the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (-77.0 vs. -162.0&#xa0;min, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.442). Clinical AF, as opposed to subclinical AF, was independently linked to decreased basal respiration and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Although the changes in AHREs burden over the 3 months did not significantly differ between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, dapagliflozin significantly decreased the number of AHREs per month by 2.2 episodes among patients with clinical AF, whereas the placebo group experienced an increase of 0.6 episodes (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). Additionally, dapagliflozin significantly reduced cellular oxidative stress (from 26840 to 18164 arbitrary units, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049) and improved mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity (SRC) percentage (from 166 to 202%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016) in patients with clinical AF. Dapagliflozin did not significantly reduce the longest AHRE duration in patients with CIED. However, in the subgroup of patients with clinical AF, dapagliflozin reduced the number of AHREs potentially via reduction of cellular oxidative stress and enhancement of mitochondrial function.The study protocol was registered at the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR identification number TCTR20210315003) on March 15, 2021.
