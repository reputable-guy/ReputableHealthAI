Study Title: Preventing cognitive decline via digital inclusion and virtual game management: an intervention study with older adults in the community.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the impact of cognitive stimulationdigital inclusion and the practice of video games on the cognition of the older population. This is a randomized controlled intervention study, nested in a population cohort study. Based on the application of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test, individuals aged 60&#x2009;years or older with scores 0 and 0.5 were included and randomly allocated in the Intervention Group (IG) or Control Group (CG). Initially, 160 participants met the selection criteria and underwent neuropsychological evaluationthe Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), applied before and after intervention. The IG (&#x2009;=&#x2009;62) participated in computer-based intervention once a week for one-and-a-half hours, for 4&#x2009;months. The CG (&#x2009;=&#x2009;47) participated in the mindfulness workshops held in the same period. The digital literacy intervention group averaged 2.6 points more in the MoCA after 4&#x2009;months. The change in the final MoCA decreased in 0.46 points at each unit in the basal MoCA. Individuals with average schooling had an increase of 0.93 points in the change of the MoCA in relation to individuals with low or high schooling. Digital inclusion combined with the practice of video games has the potential to improve the cognition of the older population.
