Study Title: Effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Study Summary:
The effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants is assessed in this study. Twenty-four participants (19-49&#xa0;years) were randomized to one of two treatment sequences in which either esketamine 84&#xa0;mg or placebo was intranasally administered in a double-blind, two-period crossover design. Primary measures included five tests of Cogstatecomputerized test battery assessed at 1&#xa0;h predose and 40&#xa0;min, 2, 4, and 6&#xa0;h postdose. Secondary measures included the Mental Effort Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and safety. Esketamine was associated with significant cognitive performance impairment at 40&#xa0;min postdose for all five Cogstate&#xae; tests (Detection p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0011, Identification p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0006, One-Card Learning p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0040, One Back p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0017, and Groton Maze Learning Test p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001) versus placebo. In contrast, performance on these tests did not differ significantly between esketamine and placebo at 2, 4, or 6&#xa0;h postdose. Secondary outcomes indicated a significant, transient increase from baseline under esketamine versus placebo at 40&#xa0;min postdose on the Mental Effort Scale and at 40&#xa0;min and 2&#xa0;h postdose on KSS (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001 for both); however, no significant difference was observed on these outcomes between esketamine and placebo at later timepoints. The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness (67%), nausea (37.5%), disturbance in attention (29.2%), and fatigue (29.2%); the majority were considered mild in severity. Esketamine was associated with cognitive performance decline, and greater effort was required to complete the test battery versus placebo at 40&#xa0;min postdose, which returned to placebo-comparable levels by 2&#xa0;h postdose.
