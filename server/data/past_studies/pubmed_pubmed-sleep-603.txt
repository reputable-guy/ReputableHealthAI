Study Title: Effects of a Multicomponent Intervention With Cognitive Training and Lifestyle Guidance for Older Adults at Risk of Dementia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study examined the effects of a multicomponent intervention program on cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD).This was a 2-arm, randomized controlled trial in which a multicomponent intervention was applied. Participants were recruited from June 2020 to August 2020, randomization and intervention began in August 2020, and the entire program ended in January 2021. It included cognitive training (mnemonic strategy training) and lifestyle guidance (diet, sleep, and exercise guidance) for 7 weeks. A total of 123 Chinese community-dwelling older adults experiencing MCI or SCD were randomly divided into a multicomponent intervention group (n = 62) and a health education group (n = 61). The global cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The cognitive domains outcomes included memory functions measured using the immediate and delayed tests of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and Logical Memory Test (LMT), and executive function and attention measured using the Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Digit Span Test (DST). Data were collected at baseline and postintervention.For cognitive outcome, the results of linear mixed-effect model showed significant time &#xd7; group effects in the MMSE (Cohen=0.63 [95% CI, 0.27 to 1.00],= 10.25,= .002). This study found significant time &#xd7; group effects in AVLT-immediate (Cohen= 0.47 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.83],= 8.18,= .005), AVLT delayed (Cohen= 0.45 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.81],= 4.59,= .034), LMT-delayed (Cohen= 0.71 [95% CI, 0.34 to 1.07],= 4.59,= .034), DSST (Cohen= 0.27 [95% CI, -0.08 to 0.63],= 4.83,= .030), and DST (Cohen=0.69 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.05],= 8.58,= .004).The results support the feasibility and effectiveness of the multicomponent intervention program in improving cognitive function in community dwelling older adults at risk of dementia. The high adherence of this program shows its potential for promotion in the community and supports a larger and longer trial.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200061420).
