Study Title: Effect of three enteral diets with different protein contents on protein metabolism in critically ill infants: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The optimal intake to improve protein metabolism without producing adverse effects in seriously ill infants has yet to be established. The aim of our study was to analyse whether an increased protein intake delivered through enteral nutrition would be associated with an improvement in nitrogen balance and serum protein levels in critically ill infants. We conducted a multicentre, prospective randomized controlled trial (December 2016-June 2019). The sample consisted of critically ill infants receiving enteral nutrition assigned randomly to 3 protein content groups: standard diet (1.7&#x202f;g/dL), protein-enriched diet (2.7&#x202f;g/dL) and high protein-enriched diet (5.1&#x202f;g/dL). Blood and urine tests were performed, and we assessed nitrogen balance at baseline and at 3-5 days of the diet. We analysed variations in nitrogen balance and serum protein levels (total protein, albumin, transferrin, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein) throughout the study period. Ninety-nine infants (33 per group) completed the study. We did not find any differences were between groups in demographic characteristics, severity scores or prescribed medications, except for corticosteroids, administered in a higher proportion of patients in the third group. We observed significant increases in prealbumin and retinol-binding protein levels in patients receiving the protein-enriched and high protein-enriched diets at 3-5 days compared to baseline. The nitrogen balance increased in all groups, but the differences were not significant in the high protein-enriched group. There were no differences in gastrointestinal tolerance. Patients fed high protein-enriched formula had higher levels of serum urea, with a higher incidence of hyperuraemia in this group. Enteral administration of higher amounts of protein improves serum protein levels in critically ill children. A protein intake of 2.2&#x202f;g/kg/day is generally safe and well tolerated, whereas an intake of 3.4&#x202f;g/kg/day may produce hyperuraemia in some patients.
