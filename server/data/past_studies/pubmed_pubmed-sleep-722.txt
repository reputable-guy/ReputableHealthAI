Study Title: Effect of a nutraceutical combination on sleep quality among people with impaired sleep: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, adults with impaired sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;5) were randomly assigned using a minimization algorithm to receive a formulation containing L-theanine plus lemon balm, valerian, and saffron extracts, or placebo, during 6&#xa0;weeks. Objective sleep quality parameters were measured using an actigraphy device. We enrolled and randomised 64 individuals, 31 from the active group and 27 from the placebo group completed the 6&#xa0;week follow-up. Mean sleep efficiency remained unmodified in the active group, and increased by 3% in the placebo group, the between-group difference in the change was not statistically significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.49). Total sleep time also improved more with placebo (13.0 vs. 1.33&#xa0;min, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.66). Time wake after sleep onset (WASO) decreased more in the active group (4.6% vs. 2.4%), but the difference was not significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.33). Mean PSQI decreased by 3.11 points (32.3%) in the active group, and by 3.86 points (39.5%) in the placebo group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41). SF-36 increased more with placebo (+&#x2009;18.3 in active,&#x2009;+&#x2009;32.1 in placebo, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68). Salivary cortisol remained unchanged in both groups. No serious adverse events were reported. Among adults with impaired sleep, a nutraceutical combination did not improve objective or subjective sleep parameters more than a placebo infusion.
