Study Title: Burden of Wilson Disease among patients and care partners in the United States: results from a cross-sectional survey.

Study Summary:
This study assessed the burden of Wilson Disease (WD) among patients and care partners (WD-CPs) in the US and compared it to a US general population of adults (GPs) and care partners (GP-CPs). This cross-sectional, self-reported survey included patients with WD and WD-CPs aged &#x2265;18&#x2009;years recruited through the Wilson Disease Association (WDA), while data for GPs and GP-CPs were obtained from the 2022 National Health and Wellness Survey. GPs and GP-CPs were propensity score matched (3:1) with WD patients and WD-CPs for demographics and health characteristics. Bivariate analysis evaluated differences in comorbidity burden and health-related outcomes of the WD cohorts compared to matched GP cohorts. Thirty-seven patients with WD and 53 WD-CPs completed the survey. Most patients reported some treatment burden (73.3%), experienced sleep problems (60%), and visited a healthcare provider (HCP) in the past 6&#x2009;months (91.9%). Compared with matched GPs, patients with WD had a significantly higher mortality risk (< .001) and reported greater rates of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis (both,< .001), migraines (= .032), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (= .004), sleep problems (= .009) and HCP visits (= .002). Most WD-CPs (75.5%) reported high burden of caring (mean ZBI-12 score, 26.5) and more negative impact on esteem than GP-CPs. This study highlights the burden of WD experienced by patients and WD-CPs, with patients experiencing high treatment burden, comorbidity burden and healthcare resource utilization, and WD-CPs experiencing high impact of caring, including impact on employment and self-esteem.
