Study Title: Randomized Control Trial on Internet-Based Self-Management of Arteriovenous Fistula in Hemodialysis Patients.

Study Summary:
To assess the impact of incorporating internet-based resources and popular science workshops on self-care management among hemodialysis patients with arteriovenous fistula. A randomized controlled trial involving 110 hemodialysis patients with arteriovenous fistula, randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group received self-management training utilizing internet resources and interactive workshops, while the control group received conventional health education methods. After the intervention, the self-management proficiency of both groups was assessed, including comprehension of arteriovenous fistula-related information, satisfaction levels, self-care abilities, engagement in functional exercises, quality of life, and other relevant factors. Patients in the experimental group exhibited significantly greater proficiency in arteriovenous fistula self-management knowledge, higher levels of patient satisfaction, enhanced self-management abilities, improved functional exercise performance, and better overall quality of life compared to those in the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The combination of internet resources and popular science workshops presents a novel and promising approach for educating and promoting self-care management among hemodialysis patients with arteriovenous fistula. This method holds potential for widespread dissemination and implementation in science education. The study demonstrates the tangible benefits of integrating internet-based resources and popular science workshops into self-management training for arteriovenous fistula among hemodialysis patients, as evidenced by improved knowledge, satisfaction, abilities, exercise performance, and quality of life in the experimental group compared to the control group.
