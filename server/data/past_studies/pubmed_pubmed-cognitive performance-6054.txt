Study Title: Assessing the longevity of attribute framing in attenuating the nocebo effect to brand and generic medication.

Study Summary:
The perception of taking a generic, relative to brand, medication has been demonstrated to exacerbate the nocebo effect. Conversely, positive attribute framing has been shown to attenuate the nocebo effect. However, little is known about the longevity of positive attribute framing nor how it interacts with generic versus brand treatment cues. Healthy participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;205) were randomised to receive either sham-modafinil capsules with a brand or generic appearance, in conjunction with standard negative side effect framing (brand-negative: N&#x2009;=&#x2009;42; generic-negative: N&#x2009;=&#x2009;41) or positive side effect framing (brand-positive: N&#x2009;=&#x2009;40; generic-positive: N&#x2009;=&#x2009;40). The remainder were randomised to a no-treatment control (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;42). Participants were informed that modafinil could enhance alertness and cognitive performance and reduce fatigue. Critically, modafinil was described as having several potential side effects. Treatment-related side effects, alertness, fatigue and cognitive performance were measured at baseline, 30-min post-treatment and 24&#x2009;h later. Nocebo and placebo effects were observed across modafinil-treated participants relative to control. Positive framing significantly reduced warned side effects for 24&#x2009;h. Perceived side effect likelihood, severity, and worry mediated the nocebo, but not framing, effect. Results have important implications for the presentation of side effect information, providing a potential route to reduce unwanted negative effects of generic medication.
