Study Title: Implementation of Coaching to Address Burnout in Emergency Clinicians.

Study Summary:
Factors including sleep disturbances, shift work, secondary traumatization, and workplace violence make emergency nurses uniquely susceptible to burnout. A recent study cited nearly half of emergency registered nurses (49.3%) experienced moderate to severe burnout. There is an urgent need for evidence-based solutions to address burnout and turnover in emergency nurses. The objective of this quality improvement project was to determine the effectiveness of a wellness coaching program for reducing burnout and turnover in emergency nurses and advanced practice providers. Baseline assessments of burnout and turnover intention were measured at the beginning of the coaching program and measured again upon completion of the coaching program. Eight registered nurses and 2 advanced practice providers from an emergency department in a west coast community hospital completed 6 to 8&#xa0;weeks of wellness coaching led by a board-certified nurse coach. The wellness coaching program was an evidence-based, modular curriculum in which participants chose the number and length of sessions. An average of 6 hours of individualized, 1-on-1 wellness coaching was completed over 7.5&#xa0;weeks. The project resulted in a large reduction in emotional exhaustion and turnover intention, no effect on depersonalization, and a small reduction in lack of personal achievement (Cohen's d&#xa0;= 0.79, 1.53,&#xa0;-0.18, and&#xa0;-0.35). Ninety percent of clinicians agreed or strongly agreed that coaching helped improve their burnout and said they would consider it again in the future. This quality improvement project demonstrates wellness coaching was an evidence-based solution for improving burnout and turnover in emergency nurses. More investigation is needed to determine duration of reduction of these outcomes.
