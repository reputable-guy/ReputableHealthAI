Study Title: Effect of neuronavigated repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on pain, cognition and cortical excitability in fibromyalgia syndrome.

Study Summary:
Fibromyalgia syndrome is a widespread chronic pain condition identified by body-wide pain, fatigue, cognitive fogginess, and sleep issues. In the past decade, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has emerged as a potential management tool.. In the present study, we enquired whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could modify pain, corticomotor excitability, cognition, and sleep. Study is a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial; wherein after randomizing thirty-four fibromyalgia patients into active or sham therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17 each), each participant received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. In active therapy was given at 1&#xa0;Hz for 20 sessions were delivered on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (1200 pulses, 150 pulses per train for 8 trains); while in sham therapy coil was placed at right angle to the scalp with same frequency. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify the therapeutic site. Pain intensity, corticomotor excitability, cognition, and sleep were examined before and after therapy. Baseline demographic and clinical parameters for both active and sham groups were comparable. In comparison to sham, active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation showed significant difference in pain intensity (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, effect size&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.29, large effect) after intervention. Other parameters of pain perception, cognition, and sleep quality also showed a significant improvement after the therapy in active therapy group only, as compared to sham. Findings suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention is effective in managing pain alongside cognition and sleep disturbances in patients of fibromyalgia. It may prove to be an important tool in relieving fibromyalgia-associated morbidity.
