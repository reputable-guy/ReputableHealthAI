Study Title: Nutritional Management in Stricturing Crohn's Disease: A Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
More than half of patients with Crohn's disease develop intestinal fibrosis induced intestinal obstruction with debilitating symptoms throughout their disease course. The incidence of stricture formation in CD has remained unchanged over the last several decades. Factors promoting intestinal fibrosis are currently unclear, but diet may represent an underestimated risk factor for intestinal fibrosis by modification of both the host immune response and intestinal microbial composition. Evaluating the impact of diet on the course of IBD is very complex. Sarcopenia is a common problem in IBD patients and correlates with an increased rate of disease. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) is an important parameter to measure sarcopenia and is an easily accessible tool for evaluating the likelihood of complications in individuals with CD. Using a randomized and controlled pilot design, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of 12 months of short-term dietary intervention based on essential amino acid (EAA) and sodium butyrate (NaB) supplementation in the management of stricturing Crohn's disease patients. After the treatment in the diet EAA/NaB group, we revealed a statistically significant improvement of muscle mass (61.49 &#xb1; 5.47 vs. control 86 &#xb1; 10.70,= 0.01) and SMI index (9.97 &#xb1; 1.79 vs. control 7.60 &#xb1; 2.29,= 0.02). In addition, the measurement of skeletal muscle mass in CD patients has been suggested to be crucial for predicting the disease course. Indeed, after one year, surgery was required in 4/10 control group patients (40%) and 1/10 study group (10%) patients, underlining the importance of body composition alterations and adequate dietary intake in the management of these patients. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results; nonetheless this nutritional approach could become an integral part in the treatment of stricturing CD patients to improve disease outcomes and increase the quality of life in these patients.
