Study Title: Impact of Plant-Based Recovery Supplements on Exercise Performance

Study Summary:
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of a plant-based recovery supplement blend on post-exercise recovery markers and subsequent performance.

Methodology:

1. Study Design
Type: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial
Duration: 8 weeks
Sample Size: 120 participants
Groups: Intervention (n=60) and Placebo (n=60)

2. Participant Characteristics
Demographics:
- Age range: 20-40 years
- Gender distribution: 50% female, 50% male
- Training status: Recreationally active (3-5 sessions/week)
- No current supplements use

Inclusion Criteria:
- Regular exercise routine (minimum 6 months)
- No injuries in past 3 months
- Normal BMI range (18.5-27.0)
- No dietary restrictions

3. Intervention Protocol
Supplementation:
- Form: Plant-based protein blend with adaptogens
- Dosage: 30g post-workout
- Timing: Within 30 minutes of exercise
- Duration: 8 weeks

Control:
- Matched placebo (taste, texture, appearance)
- Same administration protocol
- Identical packaging

4. Measurements
Primary Outcomes:
- Muscle soreness scores
- Recovery time
- Subsequent performance
- Sleep quality

Secondary Outcomes:
- Inflammation markers
- Muscle damage markers
- Perceived readiness
- Training volume

5. Data Collection Methods
Objective Measures:
- Blood biomarkers
- Heart rate variability
- Sleep tracking
- Performance tests

Subjective Measures:
- Recovery questionnaire
- Sleep quality assessment
- Readiness scores
- Training logs

6. Results and Findings
Primary Outcomes:
- 25% reduction in muscle soreness
- 20% improvement in recovery time
- 15% increase in subsequent performance
- 18% improvement in sleep quality

Secondary Outcomes:
- Reduced inflammation markers
- Lower muscle damage indicators
- Enhanced perceived readiness
- Maintained training volume

7. Statistical Analysis
Methods Used:
- Mixed-effects modeling
- Repeated measures ANOVA
- Correlation analysis
- Effect size calculations

Key Findings:
- Significant improvement in recovery (p<0.001)
- Large effect size for muscle soreness (d=0.85)
- Moderate effect for performance (d=0.65)
- Strong correlation with sleep quality

8. Safety Monitoring
Adverse Events:
- Minor digestive issues (5%)
- Mild bloating (3%)
- No serious adverse events
- High tolerability

Safety Measures:
- Weekly check-ins
- Blood marker monitoring
- Dietary compliance checks
- Training load monitoring

9. Protocol Compliance
Adherence Rates:
- 94% supplement compliance
- 90% training adherence
- 92% data collection completion
- 95% follow-up rate

Quality Control:
- Daily compliance tracking
- Regular data validation
- Protocol adherence checks
- Equipment calibration

10. Conclusions
Key Takeaways:
- Significant improvement in recovery
- Enhanced subsequent performance
