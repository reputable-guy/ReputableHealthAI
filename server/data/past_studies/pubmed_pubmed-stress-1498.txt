Study Title: Atraumatic care practice from the child and parent perspective: The case of a pediatric phlebotomy unit.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to determine the effect of the child's self-selected distraction methods used during the phlebotomy procedure on the feeling of fear and pain in children and parental satisfaction. The study, planned as a randomized controlled trial, was conducted with 219 children aged 5-10&#xa0;years and their parents in the pediatric phlebotomy unit between March and June 2023. Different distraction methods (foam balloon, stress ball, musical book) were applied to the children in the intervention group during the phlebotomy procedure. The data were analyzed with the SPSS 22.0 package program. There was a statistically significant difference between the scores of the children in the intervention and control groups on the Children's Fear Scale before the phlebotomy, and on the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale after phlebotomy according to self- and parental assessment (p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference was found between the satisfaction levels of the parents after the procedure in the intervention and control groups with the health care service provided during the phlebotomy process (p < 0.05). Distraction methods, one of the atraumatic nursing interventions used before the phlebotomy procedure, were determined to be effective in reducing the child's fear and the pain experienced due to the procedure. The study also showed that the satisfaction of parents was positively affected by the atraumatic care provided to their children. The atraumatic care approach should be used to prevent anxiety and fear experienced by parents and children and to reduce the child's pain.
