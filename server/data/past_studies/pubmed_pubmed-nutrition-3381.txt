Study Title: Advancing Healthy Lifestyles:: A Multicomponent Initiative to Reduce the Burden of Obesity In Delaware.

Study Summary:
Chronic Disease, Health Equity, & COVID-19 ("Advancing Healthy Lifestyles" or "AHL") is a statewide initiative launched in January 2021 by the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health (DPH). DPH's Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity Prevention Program (PANO) introduced the initiative as Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) swept through the state, exacerbating health burdens already faced by many Delawareans. The PANO Program provides administrative staff support to the Delaware Cancer Consortium's Cancer Risk Reduction Committee (CRRC). In December 2019, the CRRC launched the Healthy Lifestyles Subcommittee (HLSC) in response to Governor John Carney's request to develop actionable policy recommendations to positively influence healthy lifestyles in Delaware. The HLSC efforts led to the recommendation of 14 policy recommendations for action in three population health strategic focus areas: 1) birth to age 18; 2) employee health and wellness; and 3) community wellness. The AHL initiative builds from the work of the HLSC and promotes the use of policy, systems, and environmental change (PSE) strategies to reduce obesity and other chronic conditions among Delawareans across the lifespan. Ideally, the AHL initiative is categorized into three component strategies: school, community, and workplace. This article highlights both completed and ongoing projects under the AHL Initiative that aim to address the burden of obesity in Delaware.
