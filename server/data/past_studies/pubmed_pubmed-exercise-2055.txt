Study Summary:
Jiang, G, Tan, X, Zou, J, and Wu, X. A 24-week combined resistance and balance training program improves physical function in older adults: a randomized controlled trial. J Strength Cond Res 39(1): e62-e69, 2025-This randomized controlled trial assessed the feasibility of older adults performing combined resistance and balance training (RBT) and compared the effects of RBT on physical function with those of resistance training (RT) alone and with no exercise training in older adults. In total, 65 community-dwelling adults aged 60-74 years were randomly assigned to an RT (n = 22), RBT (n = 22), or control (n = 21) group. The exercise intervention consisted of RT or RBT for 45 minutes, 3 times per week for 24 weeks. The control group engaged in no exercise training. The compliance rates were 93% in the RT group and 92% in the RBT group. No training-related adverse effect was observed. In the RT and RBT groups, dynamic balance (p = 0.017; p < 0.001, respectively), maximum walking speed (p = 0.014; p < 0.001), upper extremity (p = 0.013; p = 0.009) and lower extremity (p = 0.009; p < 0.001) muscle strength, and spirometry (p = 0.043; p = 0.018) were significantly improved at 24 weeks compared with the control group. Only the RBT group showed significant improvement in normal walking speed (p = 0.002). Compared with the RT group, the RBT group showed additional significant improvements in dynamic balance (p = 0.001) and lower limb muscle strength (p = 0.027). The findings of this randomized controlled trial indicated that RBT was safe and feasible for older adults. Long-term RBT had better effects than either no exercise training or RT alone on improving physical function in older adults. Compared with RT, RBT additionally benefited dynamic balance and lower limb muscle function, which are clinically important factors in preventing falls, frailty, disability, and other geriatric syndromes.
