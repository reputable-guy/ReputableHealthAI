Study Title: Effectiveness of group problem management plus in distressed Syrian refugees in T&#xfc;rkiye: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Despite high levels of psychological distress, mental health service use among Syrian refugees in urban settings is low. To address the mental healthcare gap, the World Health Organization developed group problem management plus (gPM+), a scalable psychological intervention delivered by non-specialist peer facilitators. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gPM+ in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety among Syrian refugees in Istanbul, T&#xfc;rkiye. A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 368 distressed (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, K10 > 15) adult Syrian refugees with impaired functioning (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS 2.0 > 16). Participants were recruited between August 2019 and September 2020 through a non-governmental organization providing services to refugees. Participants were randomly allocated to gPM+ and enhanced care as usual (gPM+/E-CAU) (184 participants) or E-CAU only (184 participants). Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25)) at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5; PCL-5), functional impairment (WHODAS 2.0), and self-identified problems (psychological outcome profiles). Intent-to-treat analyses showed no significant effect of gPM+ on symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD and self-identified problems. Yet, there was a significant reduction in functional impairment in gPM+/E-CAU compared to E-CAU at 3-month follow-up (adjusted mean difference 1.66, 95 % CI 0.04, 3.27,= 0.045,= 0.19). Post-hoc subgroup analyses among participants with probable baseline depression or anxiety showed that there was a small but significant reduction in depression (adjusted mean difference -0.17, 95 % CI -0.32, -0.02,= 0.028,= 0.27) and anxiety (adjusted mean difference -0.21, 95 % CI -0.37, -0.05,= 0.009,= 0.30) symptoms comparing gPM+/E-CAU to E-CAU only at 1-week post assessment, but not at 3-month follow-up. There was a significant difference between conditions on functional impairment at 3-month follow-up, favouring gPM+/E-CAU condition (adjusted mean difference -1.98, 95 % CI -3.93, -0.02,= 0.048,= 0.26). In this study in an urban setting in T&#xfc;rkiye, gPM+ did not alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety among Syrian refugees experiencing psychological distress and daily living difficulties. However, participants with higher distress at baseline seemed to benefit from gPM+, but treatment gains disappeared in the long term. Current findings highlight the potential benefit of tailored psychosocial interventions for highly distressed refugees in volatile low-resource settings.
