Study Title: Efficacy and Safety of TAS-303 in Female Patients With Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of TAS-303, a highly selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, in Japanese women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). A double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study randomized women with SUI symptoms to once-daily oral administration of TAS-303 18 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was percent change from baseline to Week 12 in mean SUI episode frequency per 24 hours (SUIEF) in the per-protocol set. The secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with &#x2265; 50% reduction in mean SUIEF, incontinence episode frequency, incontinence amount, health-related quality of life, and safety in the full analysis set. In total, 231 patients were randomized to TAS-303 (n = 116) or placebo (n = 115). At Week 12, TAS-303 had superior efficacy to placebo, with a least squares mean percent change in mean SUIEF of -57.7% vs -46.9%, respectively, in the per-protocol set (least squares mean difference -10.8%;= .036). TAS-303 showed some evidence of improved incontinence episode frequency, incontinence amount, and health-related quality of life (although not statistically significant) at Week 12 vs placebo in the full analysis set. The between-group difference in SUIEF improvement was more clearly confirmed in patients with &#x2265; 2 SUI episodes daily at baseline. All adverse events (AEs) with TAS-303 were mild or moderate; there were no serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or nervous system- or gastrointestinal-related (eg, nausea or vomiting) adverse drug reactions. Once-daily TAS-303 18 mg showed superior efficacy to placebo for the treatment of SUI in Japanese women, with an adequate safety profile.
