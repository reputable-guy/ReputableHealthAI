Study Title: [Impact of short-peptide exclusive enteral nutrition therapy on physical growth and nutritional status in children with Crohn's disease].

Study Summary:
To evaluate the clinical efficacy of short-peptide exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) therapy in inducing remission during active Crohn's disease (CD) in children, as well as changes in physical growth and nutritional indicators before and after treatment. A prospective study included 43 children with active CD who were admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 2017 to January 2024. The participants were randomly divided into a medication treatment group (13 children) and a short-peptide + medication treatment group (30 children). The changes in the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) scores, physical growth, and nutritional indicators before and after treatment were analyzed in both groups. The PCDAI scores in the short-peptide + medication treatment group were lower than those in the medication treatment group after treatment (<0.05). The Z-scores for weight-for-age, body mass index, and albumin levels were higher in the short-peptide + medication treatment group compared to the medication treatment group (<0.05). In the patients with moderate to severe CD, total protein levels in the short-peptide + medication treatment group were significantly higher than those in the medication treatment group (<0.05). Short-peptide EEN therapy can induce clinical remission in children with active CD and promote their physical growth while improving their nutritional status.
