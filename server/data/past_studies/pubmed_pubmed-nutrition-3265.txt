Study Title: Comparison of the Efficacy of Indwelling Gastric Tubes in Preoperative and Postoperative Patients With Oral and Maxillofacial Malignancies.

Study Summary:
To explore the optimal plan for the timing of indwelling gastric tube placement in oral and maxillofacial malignant tumor patients. A prospective randomized controlled trial. 80 patients with oral and maxillofacial tumor were selected, and 40 patients were Pre-operative group. The remaining 40 patients were the control group, called Postoperative group. The body weight and hospital stay of the two groups were observed before and after surgery. Blood samples were taken before surgery and 1, 3 and 7 days after surgery to detect hemoglobin and plasma albumin. The number of postoperative hospitalization days in the pre-operative group was significantly lower than that in the post-operative group; postoperative hemoglobin and plasma albumins were lower in both groups compared with the preoperative level. Preoperative nasogastric tube ensured early postoperative administration of gastrointestinal nutrition, promoted postoperative plasma albumin recovery, and shortened the days of hospitalization.
