Study Title: The Effect of Time Pressure on Surgical Skill Retention in Novices: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
There are limited opportunities to practice surgical skills and techniques in residency. Therefore, it is important to explore strategies which optimize surgical simulation experiences to enhance learning outcomes and skill retention. Novice medical students (n = 29) were recruited to participate in a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) peg transfer task training. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group, practicing the peg transfer task independently, or an experimental group, practicing with time pressure. Participant skill assessments were completed before the training, after the training, and 8-weeks after the training. Subjective and objective stress measurements were taken in the form of self-report surveys and heart rate variability data, respectively. For all the skill assessment measurements, there was no difference between groups in performance on the FLS task. Both groups showed improvement in performance after the training compared to before. The experimental group reported higher stress during and after the training period compared to the control group; however, there was no difference between groups on heart rate variability metrics. Time pressure while practicing an FLS task did not significantly impact learning acquisition or retention. However, the experimental group reported higher levels of stress. This preliminary study suggests time pressure does not confer an enhanced surgical skill learning experience for novices.
