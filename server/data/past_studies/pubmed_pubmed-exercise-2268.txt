Study Title: Mechanisms of impact of web-based support and self-monitoring to augment and maintain physical activity levels: a qualitative study exploring participants' interactions with the e-coachER, a web-based support programme for people attending exercise referral schemes.

Study Summary:
e-coachER was a web-based intervention designed to support uptake and maintenance of physical activity for people attending exercise referral schemes (ERS) for weight loss, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis or a history of depression/low mood. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms of impact of the e-coachER intervention, specifically how participants interacted with e-coachER and the key mediators of increased physical activity. This was a qualitative one-on-one interview study. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. UK primary care ERS. A purposive sample of adult patients randomised to the intervention arm of the e-coachER randomised controlled trial. Twenty-six participants (20 female), who had logged on to e-coachER at least once were recruited, resulting in a total of 38 interviews (mean duration 48 min). Four broad, inter-related themes were generated from the data (1) catalyst for change, (2) goals and aspirations, (3) support and (4) engagement with the e-coachER programme. Most participants who took part in e-coachER were already motivated to improve their health and perceived e-coachER as an additional source of motivation and accountability. Many felt that the opportunity to set goals and self-monitor supported participant's competence and autonomy by enabling them to progress at their own pace. Many participants reported on how e-coachER helped them to foster a sense of relatedness by encouraging them to seek support from others. Finally, e-coachER was regarded as being generally accessible and engaging. Despite this, some found it too simplistic, and others found it hard to maintain engagement over time. The e-coachER intervention seemed to be generally motivating in the early stages of initiating behaviour change, but engagement waned over time. Our findings highlight how important an online package might be in supporting behaviour change while also highlighting the challenges of achieving sustained physical activity changes.
