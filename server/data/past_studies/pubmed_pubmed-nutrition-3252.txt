Study Title: Feasibility of an exercise-nutrition-psychology integrated rehabilitation model based on mobile health and virtual reality for cancer patients: a single-center, single-arm, prospective phase II study.

Study Summary:
Explore the feasibility of a mobile health(mHealth) and virtual reality (VR) based nutrition-exercise-psychology integrated rehabilitation model in Chinese cancer patients. We recruited cancer patients in the Oncology department of the Affiliated Changzhou No. 2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from October 2022 to April 2023. The rehabilitation program was provided by a team of medical oncologists, dietitians, psychotherapists, and oncology specialist nurses. Participants received standard anti-cancer therapy and integrated intervention including hospitalized group-based exercise classes, at-home physical activity prescription, behavior change education, oral nutrition supplements, and psychological counseling. An effective intervention course includes two consecutive hospitalization and two periods of home-based rehabilitation (8 weeks). Access the feasibility as well as changes in aspects of physical, nutritional, and psychological status. At the cutoff date of April 2023, the recruitment rate was 75% (123/165). 11.4%patients were lost to follow-up, and 3.25% withdrew halfway. Respectively, the completion rate of nutrition, exercise, and psychology were 85%,55%, and 63%. Nutrition interventions show the highest compliance. The parameters in nutrition, psychology, muscle mass, and quality of life after the rehabilitation showed significant improvements (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). There was no significant statistical difference (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05) in handgrip strength and 6-minute walking speed. It is feasible to conduct mHealth and VR-based nutrition-exercise-psychology integrated rehabilitation model in Chinese cancer patients. A larger multi-center trial is warranted in the future.
