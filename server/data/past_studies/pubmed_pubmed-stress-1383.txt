Study Title: Consumption of Sylimarin, Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Sodium Salt and Myricetin: Effects on Alcohol Levels and Markers of Oxidative Stress-A Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Alcohol abuse is one of the most common causes of mortality worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a treatment in reducing circulating ethanol and oxidative stress biomarkers. Twenty wine-drinking subjects were investigated in a randomized controlled, single-blind trial (ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT06548503; Ethical Committee of the University of Padova (HEC-DSB/12-2023) to evaluate the effect of the intake of a product containing silymarin, pyrroloquinoline quinone sodium salt, and myricetin (referred to as Si.Pi.Mi. for this project) on blood alcohol, ethyl glucuronide (EtG: marker for alcohol consumption) and markers of oxidative stress levels (Reactive Oxygen Species-ROS, Total Antioxidant Capacity-TAC, CoQ10, thiols redox status, 8-isoprostane, NO metabolites, neopterin, and uric acid). The effects of the treatment versus placebo were evaluated acutely and after 1 week of supplementation in blood and/or saliva and urine samples. Si.Pi.Mi intake reduced circulating ethanol after 120 min (-33%). Changes in oxidative stress biomarkers, particularly a TAC (range +9-12%) increase and an 8-isoprostane (marker of lipidic peroxidation) decrease (range -22-27%), were observed too. After the administration of Si.Pi.Mi, the data seemed to suggest a better alcohol metabolism and oxidative balance in response to wine intake. Further verification is requested.
