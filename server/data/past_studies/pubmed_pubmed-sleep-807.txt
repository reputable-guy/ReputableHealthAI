Study Title: The predictive value of mandibular advancement maneuvers during drug-induced sleep endoscopy for treatment success of oral appliance treatment in obstructive sleep apnea: a prospective study.

Study Summary:
To prospectively validate drug-induced sleep endoscopy with mandibular advancement maneuvers as a prediction tool for treatment success of oral appliance treatment (OAT). Seventy-seven patients diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea were included and underwent drug-induced sleep endoscopy. The upper airway collapse was assessed using the VOTE classification. Additionally, three mandibular advancement maneuvers were performed to predict treatment success of OAT. If the maneuver was negative, the level and degree and configuration of the persistent collapse was described according to the VOTE classification. All patients were treated with OAT and completed a follow-up sleep study with OAT in situ without regard to their anticipated response to treatment. Sixty-four patients completed 6-month follow up. A positive jaw thrust maneuver proved to be significantly associated with favorable OAT response, whereas the chin lift maneuver and the vertical chin lift maneuver were not. Additionally, a persistent lateral oropharyngeal collapse when performing any mandibular advancement maneuver was significantly associated with unfavorable OAT response. The current findings suggest that a jaw thrust maneuver should be preferred over the chin lift maneuver for predicting OAT response. Patients with a positive jaw thrust maneuver should be counseled toward favorable OAT response, whereas those with persistent lateral oropharyngeal collapse should be advised about the likelihood of unfavorable OAT response. A negative jaw thrust maneuver did not prove to be a significant predictor for unfavorable response to OAT. Consequently, uncertainties arise regarding the justification of performing drug-induced sleep endoscopy solely for predicting the efficacy of OAT. However, the results of the current study could be influenced by heterogeneity in the assessment of respiratory parameters, variability in the performance of the mandibular advancement maneuvers, and the instability of bolus technique sedation.
