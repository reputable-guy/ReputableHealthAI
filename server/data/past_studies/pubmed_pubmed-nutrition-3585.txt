Study Title: Reducing In-Hospital and 60-Day Mortality in Critically Ill Patients after Surgery with Strict Nutritional Supplementation: A Prospective, Single-Labeled, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition in critically ill patients is a global concern, especially those who undergo abdominal surgery, as it is associated to higher infectious complications, prolonged hospital stays, and increased morbidity. Despite the importance of proper nutrition, guidelines remain broad, and practical implementation is often inadequate. We aimed to assess the effects of strict nutritional provision and investigate the appropriate target for nutrition support. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units following abdominal surgery. The intervention group received targeted protein and calories, with consultation from a nutritional support team upon admission. In total, 181 patients in the intervention and 144 in the control group were analyzed. The intervention group demonstrated improved nutrition provision and subsequently better clinical outcomes, including a reduced 60-day mortality (4.4 versus 15.3,= 0.001), postoperative complications (24.9 versus 47.2,< 0.001), and in-hospital mortality (5 versus 17.4,< 0.001). High modified nutrition risk in the critically ill scores [odds ratio (OR) = 2.658, 95% CI = 1.498-4.716] were associated with increased 60-day mortality, while active nutritional intervention (OR = 0.312, 95% CI = 0.111-0.873) was associated with lower mortality rates. Notably, the provision of targeted energy and protein alone did not exhibit a significant association with mortality outcomes.
