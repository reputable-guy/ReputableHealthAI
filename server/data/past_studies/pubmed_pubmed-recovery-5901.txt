Study Title: Effect of high-dosesupplementation on hospitalized adults with COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
() is a cyanobacterium proven to have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant effects. However, the effect of high-dosesupplementation on hospitalized adults with COVID-19 is currently unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dosefor SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving 189 patients with COVID-19 who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an experimental group that received 15.2g ofsupplement plus standard treatment (44 non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) and 47 ICU), or to a control group that received standard treatment alone (46 non-ICU and 52 ICU). The study was conducted over six days. Immune mediators were monitored on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. The primary outcome of this study was mortality or hospital discharge within seven days, while the overall discharge or mortality was considered the secondary outcome. Within seven days, there were no deaths in thegroup, while 15 deaths (15.3%) occurred in the control group. Moreover, within seven days, there was a greater number of patients discharged in thegroup (97.7%) in non-ICU compared to the control group (39.1%) (HR, 6.52; 95% CI, 3.50 to 12.17). Overall mortality was higher in the control group (8.7% non-ICU, 28.8% ICU) compared to thegroup (non-ICU HR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.97; ICU, HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.48). In non-ICU, patients who receivedshowed a significant reduction in the levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-10, and IP-10 as intervention time increased. Furthermore, in ICU, patients who receivedshowed a significant decrease in the levels of MIP-1&#x3b1; and IL-6. IFN-&#x3b3; levels were significantly higher in the intervention group in both ICU and non-ICU subgroups as intervention time increased. No side effects related tosupplements were observed during the trial. High-dosesupplements coupled with the standard treatment of COVID-19 may improve recovery and remarkably reduce mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. https://irct.ir/trial/54375, Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials number (IRCT20210216050373N1).
