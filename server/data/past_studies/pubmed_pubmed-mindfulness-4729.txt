Study Title: A Pilot Study of Telehealth Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression in Parkinson's Disease.

Study Summary:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by high-rates of depression with limited evidence-based treatment options to improve mood.To expand therapeutic options, we evaluated the feasibility and effect of a telehealth mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention adapted for PD (MBCT-PD) in a sample of participants with DSM-5 depressive disorders.Fifteen participants with PD and clinically-significant depression completed 9 sessions of MBCT-PD. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were evaluated at baseline, endpoint, and 1-month follow-up.Telehealth MBCT-PD was feasible and beneficial. Completion rates exceeded 85% and treatment satisfaction rates were high. Notable improvements were observed for depression, anxiety, and quality of life over the course of the trial.Telehealth MBCT-PD shows promise and warrants further evaluation via randomized clinical trial with more diverse participants. Such research holds the potential to expand the range of therapeutic options for depression in PD, thereby setting the stage for personalized care.
