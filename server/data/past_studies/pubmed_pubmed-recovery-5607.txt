Study Title: Efficacy of photobiomodulation following L-PRF application for recovery of mental nerve neurosensory disturbances caused by genioplasty: A randomized triple-blind clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The present study assessed the efficacy of photobiomodulation (PBM) following leukocyte-platelet rich fibrin (L-PRF) application for recovery of mental nerve neurosensory disturbances (NSDs) caused by genioplasty. This randomized triple-blind split-mouth clinical trial was conducted on 20 female patients (40 quadrants) requiring genioplasty. In each patient, one random side of the mandible served as the intervention (laser), and the other side as the control group. After genioplasty and L-PRF application, the intervention side underwent GaAIAs diode laser irradiation (880&#xa0;nm, 500&#xa0;mW, 15&#xa0;J/cm, 0.5&#xa0;cmspot size, continuous-wave). Each point was laser irradiated for 15&#xa0;s. Unilateral extraoral PBM was performed at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28&#xa0;days, postoperatively. Laser in off mode (sham laser) was used for the control side. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for general sensitivity, and 2-point discrimination, directional discrimination, pain discrimination, and thermal discrimination tests were used to assess the neurosensory recovery at 2&#xa0;days, 2&#xa0;weeks, 4&#xa0;weeks, and 2&#xa0;months, postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA, Bonferroni test, and generalized estimating equation (alpha&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05). Time had a significant effect on improvement of all sensory variables (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Neurosensory recovery was significantly better in the intervention than the control group at all time points according to the two-point discrimination test (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0135) and brush test (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025) results. The interaction effect of time and intervention was not significant on any dependent variable (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). Application of L-PRF&#xa0;+&#xa0;PBM resulted in significantly greater sensorineural recovery according to the two-point discrimination and brush test results.
