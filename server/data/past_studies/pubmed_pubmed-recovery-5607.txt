Study Title: A comparative study of acupuncture combined with rehabilitation gymnastics on postoperative anal function of lower rectal cancer.

Study Summary:
From the anal function, inflammatory response and other indicators, acupuncture combined with rehabilitation gymnastics was applied to patients with cancer undergoing low resection, aiming to improve the prognosis of patients. To explore the effects of acupuncture combined with rehabilitation gymnastics on anal function after lower rectal cancer surgery. From January 2020 to December 2022, 128 patients who underwent rectal cancer surgery in the Department of Oncology of Hebei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital were selected and divided into two groups using the random number table method, with 64 patients in each group. Patients in the control group were not treated with acupuncture or rehabilitation gymnastics and served as blank controls. Patients in the study group were treated with acupuncture and rehabilitation gymnastics from the 7th postoperative day. The anal incontinence scores, changes in serum interleukin-4, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 Levels, and serum motilin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and vasoactive intestinal peptide levels were compared. There were no significant differences in serum interleukin-4, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 Levels between the groups before treatment (> 0.05). After treatment, these levels were better than those of the control group (< 0.05). There was no significant difference in the anal incontinence scores between the groups before and 7 d after surgery (> 0.05). Anal incontinence scores in the study group were lower than those in the control group at 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d postoperatively (< 0.05). There were no significant differences in serum motilin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or vasoactive intestinal peptide levels between the groups before treatment (> 0.05). After treatment, these levels were higher in the study group than in the control group, and vasoactive intestinal peptide level was lower in the study group than in the control group (< 0.05). Acupuncture combined with rehabilitation gymnastics can promote the recovery of anal function and reduce the inflammatory response in patients with lower rectal cancer after surgery.
