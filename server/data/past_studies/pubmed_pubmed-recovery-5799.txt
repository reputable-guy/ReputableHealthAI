Study Title: Recovery and immune function after low pressure pneumoperitoneum during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To compare the effectiveness of low intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) facilitated by deep neuromuscular block (NMB) to standard practice in improving the quality of recovery, preserving immune function, and enhancing parietal perfusion during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). In this blinded, randomised controlled trial, 96 patients were randomised to the experimental group with low IAP (8&#x2009;mmHg) facilitated by deep NMB (post-tetanic count 1-2) or the control group with standard IAP (14&#x2009;mmHg) and moderate NMB (train-of-four 1-2). Recovery was measured using the 40-item Quality of Recovery questionnaire and 36-item Short-Form Health survey. Immune function was evaluated by plasma damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines, and ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine production. Parietal peritoneum perfusion was measured by analysing the recordings of indocyanine-green injection. Quality of recovery was not superior in the experimental group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) compared to the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50). All clinical outcomes, including pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and hospital stay were similar. There were no significant differences in postoperative plasma concentrations of damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines, and ex vivo cytokine production capacity. The use of low IAP resulted in better parietal peritoneum perfusion. Despite better perfusion of the parietal peritoneum, low IAP facilitated by deep NMB did not improve the quality of recovery or preserve immune function compared to standard practice in patients undergoing RARP.
