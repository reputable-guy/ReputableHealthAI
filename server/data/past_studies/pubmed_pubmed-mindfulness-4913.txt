Study Title: Pilot clinical trial of a clinical meditation and imagery intervention for chronic pain after spinal cord injury.

Study Summary:
To assess the feasibility and potential benefits of clinical meditation and imagery (CMI) for people with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and chronic pain. Pilot randomized, controlled trial. Outpatients with SCI in the United States. 24 adults with chronic SCI (>1 year) and a >3 month history of pain rated &#x2265;4/10 on average over the last week. 4-week program of once-weekly 2-hour group classes, offered in-person and online. CMI group participants were taught mindfulness, mantra meditation, and guided imagery practices. Control group participants received education on topics related to health and function after SCI. Pain interference (primary outcome), pain cognitions, pain intensity/unpleasantness, depressive symptomology, perceived stress. Pain interference decreased to a greater extent in the control group at both Day 42 and Day 70, with a large effect size (d&#x2009;>&#x2009;1.0). Several secondary outcome measures showed changes consistent with more favorable outcomes in the CMI group at both Day 42 and Day 70, with a large effect size d&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.80, including worst pain intensity over the last week, depressive symptomology, belief in pain as a sign of harm and perceived control over pain. Perceived stress improved to a greater extent in the control group (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.16 at Day 42, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;.20 at Day 70). CMI is feasible and acceptable to implement with people with SCI and chronic pain. Further study is warranted to assess potential benefits for pain-related outcomes.
