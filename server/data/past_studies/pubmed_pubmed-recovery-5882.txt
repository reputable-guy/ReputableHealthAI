Study Title: Erector spinae plane block versus quadratus lumborum block for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic nephrectomy: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
We compared the analgesic effects of erector spinae plane block versus quadratus lumborum block following laparoscopic nephrectomy. A randomized controlled trial. A tertiary hospital in Beijing, China. Patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic nephrectomy. A total of 110 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive either erector spinae plane block (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;55) or quadratus lumborum block (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;55) under ultrasound guidance. Patient-controlled sufentanil analgesia was provided after surgery. Our primary outcome was cumulative opioid consumption within 24&#xa0;h after surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain intensity, subjective sleep quality, and quality of recovery. All 110 patients (mean 53&#xa0;years, 57.3% female) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Cumulative sufentanil equivalent within 24&#xa0;h was lower in patients given erector spinae plane block (median 13&#xa0;&#x3bc;g, interquartile range 4 to 33) than in those given quadratus lumborum block (median 25&#xa0;&#x3bc;g, interquartile range 13 to 39; median difference&#xa0;-&#xa0;8&#xa0;&#x3bc;g, 95% CI -15 to 0, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.041). Pain intensity (0-10 range where 0&#xa0;=&#xa0;no pain and 10&#xa0;=&#xa0;the worst pain) at 2, 6, 12, and 24&#xa0;h after surgery was lower with erector spinae plane block (at rest: median differences -1 point, all P&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.009; with movement: median differences -2 to -1 points, all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Subjective sleep quality on the night of surgery (the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire: 0-100 range, higher score better; median difference 12, 95% CI 2 to 23, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.018) and quality of recovery at 24&#xa0;h (the Quality of Recovery-15: 0-150 range, higher score better; median difference 8, 95% CI 2 to 15, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.012) were better with erector spinae plane block. No procedure-related adverse events occurred. Compared with quadratus lumborum block, erector spinae plane block provided better analgesia as manifested by lower opioid consumption and pain intensity for up to 24&#xa0;h after laparoscopic nephrectomy.
