Study Title: Prefrontal Cortex Neuromodulation Enhances Frontal Asymmetry and Reduces Caloric Intake in Patients with Morbid Obesity.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of a combined intervention involving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and cognitive training (CT). Short-term effects on food consumption, cognition, endocannabinoid (eCB) levels, and electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xa0;markers of future weight loss were explored. Eighteen healthy volunteers with morbid obesity were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Participants received sham or active tDCS plus CT for four consecutive days. Cognitive performance, daily food intake, and eCB blood samples were collected before and after the intervention; EEG data were gathered before and after daily training. The active tDCS&#x2009;+&#x2009;CT group reversed left-dominant frontal asymmetry and increased frontal coherence (FC) in the &#x3b3;-band (30-45 Hz) after the intervention. The strength of the latter predicted BMI reduction. Additionally, a large intervention effect on food intake was shown in the active tDCS&#x2009;+&#x2009;CT group at follow-up (-339.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;639 kcal on average), and there was a decrease of plasma eCB concentrations. dlPFC modulation through tDCS&#x2009;+&#x2009;CT is an effective tool to restore right dominance of the dlPFC and enhance FC in patients with morbid obesity. Moreover, the effect of the strength of FC on BMI suggests that the interhemispheric FC at the dlPFC is functionally relevant for the efficient regulation of food choice.
