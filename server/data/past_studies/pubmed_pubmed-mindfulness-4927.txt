Study Title: The Relationships Between Reduced Alcohol Use and Decreased Burnout Following Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training in Law Enforcement Officers.

Study Summary:
This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in an earlier clinical trial of mindfulness-based resilience training (MBRT) (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number 02521454), where the MBRT condition demonstrated a significant reduction in self-reported burnout and trend-level reductions in alcohol use in law enforcement officers (LEOs). Given that MBRT is not designed to be a substance use intervention and does not contain explicit substance-related content, this study sought to clarify these findings by exploring whether improved burnout mediates reduced alcohol use.Participants (&#x2009;=&#x2009;61) were sworn LEOs (89% male, 85% White, 8% Hispanic/Latinx) recruited from departments in a large urban metro area of the northwestern United States, and were randomized to either MBRT (&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) or no intervention control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) during the trial.MBRT group assignment predicted reduced burnout (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43, standard error [SE]&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.14,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), which subsequently predicted reduced alcohol use (&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.69, SE&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.81,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045). Results suggest that reduced alcohol use was indirectly related to a reduction in burnout post-MBRT.Given that MBRT does not explicitly address substance use, these findings were interpreted to suggest that officers in the training acquired a new set of coping skills to deal with the operational and organizational stressors of police work.
