Study Title: A Randomized Clinical Trial of a Quitline Vaping Cessation Intervention: Baseline Characteristics of Young Adult Exclusive E-Cigarette Users Seeking Treatment.

Study Summary:
Despite interest in quitting vaping among young adults (YAs), little is known about characteristics of e-cigarette (EC) users seeking treatment. In this study, YAs aged 18-24 living in the United States interested in vaping cessation treatment were recruited to complete an online survey regarding demographics and EC use. Primary eligibility criteria were EC use on at least 20 days per month (no other tobacco use), and interest in quitting in the next month. We report descriptive statistics for those who did and did not complete a mandatory coaching call (= 981). In this sample, most EC users reported high nicotine dependence, a history of unsuccessful quit attempts (including 29.4% with previous NRT use), along with stress, anxiety, and depression. There were few meaningful differences in demographics, EC use behaviors, or behavioral health factors between those who engaged with a phone coaching call (fully enrolled in study;= 508), and those who did not (= 473). YAs demonstrated interest in vaping cessation support, but there were no clear characteristics for the half who did not complete a coaching call. Vaping cessation program designers should consider tailoring for the self-reported behavioral health concerns present in this population.
