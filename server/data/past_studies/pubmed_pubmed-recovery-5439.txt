Study Title: Virtual reality-based Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE-VR) as an adjunct to medications for opioid use disorder: a Phase 1 trial.

Study Summary:
Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are the most effective interventions for this condition, yet many patients discontinue treatment. Though adjunct psychosocial treatments are recommended to increase retention and reduce relapse, the scarcity of trained providers hinders access to and utilization of evidence-based interventions. We conducted a Phase 1 study to assess the feasibility of a virtual reality-delivered Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE-VR) intervention for patients receiving MOUD. Patients receiving buprenorphine or methadone for OUD (&#x2009;=&#x2009;34) were scheduled for 8 weekly sessions of MORE-VR. Enrollment and retention rates were analyzed. Participants reported on the usability and acceptability of MORE-VR, opioid use, and craving and affect before and after each VR session. Heart rate was monitored during one session of MORE-VR. Twenty-three participants completed four or more MORE-VR sessions (minimum recommended intervention dose). Participants reported high usability and acceptability of MORE-VR, which had an excellent safety profile. Illicit opioid use decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment (&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.44,=.04). We observed a significant within-session decrease in opioid craving (&#x2009;=&#x2009;39.3,<.001) and negative affect (&#x2009;=&#x2009;36.3,<.001), and a significant within-session increase in positive affect (&#x2009;=&#x2009;23.6,<.001). Heart rate shifted during cue-exposure and mindfulness practices (&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.79,<.001). High retention, usability and acceptability rates and low adverse events demonstrated that MORE-VR is a feasible, engaging, and safe intervention. Our findings show that MORE-VR can be delivered as an adjunctive intervention to MOUD and suggest that MORE-VR may improve OUD treatment outcomes and modulate autonomic responses. MORE-VR's efficacy will be tested in a subsequent Phase 2 trial. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05034276; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05034276.
