Study Title: Mindfulness Component in a Dialectical Behavioural Therapy Group Intervention for Family Members of Borderline Personality Disorder Patients.

Study Summary:
Family members of people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are seriously affected by the disease and it is common for them to ask for professional help. The main objective of this study is to assess, in an open clinical trial, a treatment protocol based on Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) strategies for relatives of individuals with BPD, compared to the same protocol plus a mindfulness component (DBT-M). The interventions were conducted in a sample of 108 relatives of 83 patients diagnosed with BPD from a Specialized Unit for Personality Disorders. Relatives and patients completed the assessment protocol before and after the intervention. Significant improvements in almost all the relevant variables tested were observed after the treatment in both the relatives and the patients. However, there were only statistically significant differences between the groups in the negative attitude towards the illness, where relatives in the DBT-M condition showed greater improvement than those in the DBT condition. The results indicate that the intervention helps both patients and relatives to improve on key issues. It is essential to consider and offer support to the families of people with severe psychological disorders.
