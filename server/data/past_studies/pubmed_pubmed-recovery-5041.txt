Study Title: Combination of Manual Therapy and Dry Needling Effectively Improves Acute Neck Pain and Muscular Tone and Stiffness in Combat Sports Athletes: A Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to compare the effects of manual therapy combined with dry needling (MTDN) to a control group, focusing on the impact on pressure pain threshold (PPT), muscle tone (MT), muscle stiffness (MS), muscle strength, and range of motion in the neck muscles of adult combat sports athletes. A randomized controlled study design was employed, with one group of athletes (n = 15) receiving MTDN intervention, while the other group (n = 15) underwent a control treatment (CG) involving a quasi-needle technique combined with manual therapy. Both groups participated in three sessions, either in the MTDN intervention or the control condition. All athletes, who were experiencing neck pain, were evaluated at rest, after one session, after three sessions, and again 72 hours after the third session. Muscle tone (MT) and muscle stiffness (MS) were measured using myotonometry, pressure pain threshold (PPT) was assessed with an algesiometer, muscle strength was evaluated using a handheld dynamometer, and range of motion was measured with an electronic goniometer. Group comparisons revealed significantly higher MT in CG compared to MTDN after the 3rd session (< 0.001;= 1.50). Additionally, CG showed significantly greater MS than MTDN after the 3rd session (< 0.001;= 1.75) and at 72 hours post-session (< 0.001;= 2.45). Conversely, MTDN exhibited significantly greater PPT than CG at 72 hours post-session (< 0.001;= 1.80). Our results suggest that MTDN is significantly more effective in improving muscle tone, stiffness, and acute pain compared to manual therapy alone. However, no significant impact was observed on maximal strength or neck range of motion. A combined approach may offer benefits by more rapidly reducing neck pain and better preparing muscle properties for future activities.
