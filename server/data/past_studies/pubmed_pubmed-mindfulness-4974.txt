Study Title: Spiritual Self-Care Management for Nursing Professionals: A Holistic Approach.

Study Summary:
Among all the groups and occupations that have been affected by the global pandemic, nursing professionals stand out as having been particularly hard-pressed due to the dramatic increase in the need for their services. Given the rising tide of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who require specialized medical treatment as well as the millions of others that are lining up for vaccinations, it can be assumed that many nursing professionals have had to endure such things as longer working hours, tighter schedules, and the intensity of a work environment in which failure of care and multiple deaths are the daily fare. This article proposes that nurses can avoid such severe consequences by taking up a regime of enhanced self-care management that enables them to achieve psychophysical balance and wellness. Three practices are highlighted in this regard: prayer, meditative walking, and the mindfulness practice of body scanning. Our suggestion is that these coping strategies will be both beneficial and healthful for nursing professionals in terms of enhancing their spiritual/existential resilience and meeting their own need for consolation as they navigate in an extremely difficult and demanding work environment.
