Study Title: Internet-based UP-A intervention on treatment of stress, anxiety, depression, and psychological flexibility among adolescents with sub-clinical diagnosis of emotional disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: a clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This clinical trial aims to assess the effectiveness of internet-based Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-A) during the COVID-19 pandemic in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, and psychological flexibility. 40 adolescents with subclinical features of emotional disorder randomly divided into two groups of intervention and control. The participants first completed DASS-21 and AAQ-2 questionnare online. Then, the intervention group received 12 sessions of UP-A through video calls on WhatsApp, 2 days per week each for 45&#xa0;min. UP-A is an emotion-focused, cognitive-behavioral therapy consisting of 5 core modules or components that target temperamental characteristics, particularly neuroticism and resulting emotion dysregulation. Eventually the stress, anxiety, and depression levels decreased in intervention group and their psychological flexibility increased immediately and 3 months after the intervention.
