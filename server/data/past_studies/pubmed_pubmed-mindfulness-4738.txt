Study Title: The effectiveness of adapted group mindfulness-based stress management program on perceived stress and emotion regulation in midwives: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Midwives' stress can have negative consequences on their emotional state, burnout, and poor quality of midwifery care. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an adapted mindfulness-based stress management program on perceived stress and the emotional regulation of midwives. The study was a parallel randomized clinical trial on the midwives working in general hospitals of Zanjan, Iran. In this study, 121 midwives registered to participate based on the census sampling method were screened using a cut point of&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;28 in the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). From the initial sample, 42 subjects had inclusion criteria assigned to two groups of control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) and intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) using online random allocation. The intervention group received an 8-week adapted mindfulness-based stress management program. This program emanates from the Kabat-Zinn's MBSR program, which has been adjusted according to the Iranian culture. The ANCOVA and repeated measure analysis of variance test were used to compare groups over time. The results showed that the group intervention effectively affected perceived stress (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and difficulty in emotion regulation during the post-intervention period (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Moreover, the interventions were effective in emotion regulation (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), but it was not effective on perceived stress (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.125) at the 3-month follow-up. This adapted mindfulness-based program successfully reduced stress and increased emotion regulation strategies in midwives; however, the long-term outcomes of this treatment program need further consideration.
