Study Title: Postoperative recovery in peroral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment following laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis: a substudy of a cluster randomized cluster crossover non-inferiority study.

Study Summary:
Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain requiring surgery, usually managed with laparoscopic appendectomy. In Denmark, the standard postoperative treatment for complicated cases involves intravenous antibiotics. This study compares peroral versus intravenous antibiotics in the context of fast-track surgery and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of peroral versus intravenous antibiotics on patient-reported outcomes following laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. This was a sub-study within a broader Danish cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial conducted at Zealand University Hospital, focusing on adult patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Participants were randomized into two groups: one receiving a three-day course of peroral antibiotics and the other intravenous antibiotics after surgery. Recovery quality was assessed on the third postoperative day using the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) questionnaire. The study included 54 patients, 23 in the peroral and 31 in the intravenous groups. The peroral group reported significantly better recovery outcomes, with higher QoR-15 scores (mean difference of 12 points, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). They also experienced shorter hospital stays, averaging 47 h less than the intravenous group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). No significant differences between the groups were observed in readmissions or severe postoperative complications. Peroral antibiotic administration after laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis significantly improves patient recovery and reduces hospital stay compared to intravenous antibiotics. These results advocate a potential shift towards peroral antibiotic use in postoperative care, aligning with ERAS principles. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04803422.
