Study Title: Mind-Body Intervention for Dysfunctional Breathing in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Feasibility Study and Lessons Learned.

Study Summary:
Dysfunctional breathing behaviors are prevalent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although these behaviors contribute to dyspnea, abnormal carbon dioxide (CO) levels, and COPD exacerbations, they are modifiable. Current dyspnea treatments for COPD are suboptimal, because they do not adequately address dysfunctional breathing behaviors and anxiety together. We developed a complementary mind-body breathlessness therapy, called capnography-assisted respiratory therapy (CART), that uses real-time CObiofeedback at the end of exhalation (end-tidal COor ETCO), to target dysfunctional breathing habits and improve dyspnea treatment and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) adherence in COPD. The study aim was to test the feasibility of integrating CART with a traditional, clinic-based PR program in an urban setting.We used a feasibility pre- and post-test design, with 2:1 randomization to CART+PR or control (PR-alone) groups, to test and refine CART. Multi-component CART consisted of six, 1-h weekly sessions of slow breathing and mindfulness exercises, ETCObiofeedback, motivational counseling, and a home program. All participants were offered twice weekly, 1-h sessions of PR over 10 weeks (up to 20 sessions).Thirty-one participants with COPD were enrolled in the study. Approximately a third of participants had symptoms of psychological distress. Results showed that CART was feasible and acceptable based on 74% session completion and 91.7% homework exercise completion (&#x2009;=&#x2009;22). Within-group effect sizes for CART+PR were moderate to large (Cohen's&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.51-1.22) for reduction in resting Borg dyspnea (anticipatory anxiety) and respiratory rate, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) respiratory symptoms; and increase in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function and physical activity; all&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05.CART is a new mind-body breathing therapy that targets eucapnic breathing, interoceptive function, and self-regulated breathing to relieve dyspnea and anxiety symptoms in COPD. Study findings supported the feasibility of CART and showed preliminary signals that CART may improve exercise tolerance, reduce dyspnea, and enhance PR completion by targeting reduced dysfunctional breathing patterns (CTR No. NCT03457103).
