Study Title: Amisulpride augmentation therapy improves cognitive performance and psychopathology in clozapine-resistant treatment-refractory schizophrenia: a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Although clozapine is an effective option for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), there are still 1/3 to 1/2 of TRS patients who do not respond to clozapine. The main purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to explore the amisulpride augmentation efficacy on the psychopathological symptoms and cognitive function of clozapine-resistant treatment-refractory schizophrenia (CTRS) patients. A total of 80 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to receive initial clozapine plus amisulpride (amisulpride group) or clozapine plus placebo (placebo group). Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale scores, Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS), laboratory measurements, and electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed at baseline, at week 6, and week 12. Compared with the placebo group, amisulpride group had a lower PANSS total score, positive subscore, and general psychopathology subscore at week 6 and week 12 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Furthermore, compared with the placebo group, the amisulpride group showed an improved RBANS language score at week 12 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Amisulpride group had a higher treatment response rate (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), lower scores of CGI severity and CGI efficacy at week 6 and week 12 than placebo group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There were no differences between the groups in body mass index (BMI), corrected QT (QTc) intervals, and laboratory measurements. This study demonstrates that amisulpride augmentation therapy can safely improve the psychiatric symptoms and cognitive performance of CTRS patients. This study indicates that amisulpride augmentation therapy has important clinical significance for treating CTRS to improve clinical symptoms and cognitive function with tolerability and safety.
