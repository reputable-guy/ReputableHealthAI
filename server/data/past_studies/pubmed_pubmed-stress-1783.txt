Study Title: A randomized prospective comparison of the needleless mini-sling "hammock" and "U-shape" configurations for management of stress urinary incontinence: 60-month follow-up results.

Study Summary:
To compare needleless mini-slings placed in a retropubic (U-shape) or trans-obturator (hammock-shape) configuration for treating stress urinary incontinence at 60th month. All surgeries, conducted by a senior surgeon, involved objective and subjective assessments preoperatively and at 6, 12, 18, and 60 months postoperatively using cough-stress tests, ICIQ-SF, PGI-I, and a Likert scale. After 60 months, no significant differences were found in cure rates, mesh complications, or reinterventions between U-shaped and hammock-shaped groups. However, a significant decrease in cure rates was observed at 18 and 60 months in both groups. Notable differences in ICIQ-SF, Likert scale, and PGI-I scores were seen in the hammock-shaped group, while the U-shaped group showed differences in ICIQ-SF and PGI-I scores, but not in the Likert scale. Given the lack of significant differences, asserting the superiority of either retropubic (U-shape) or transobturatorly (hammock-shape) needleless mini-slings for treating stress urinary incontinence is challenging.
