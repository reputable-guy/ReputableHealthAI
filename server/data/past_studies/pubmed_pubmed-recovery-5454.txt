Study Title: Effects of a pro-resolving drug in COVID-19: preclinical studies to a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase Ib/IIa trial in hospitalized patients.

Study Summary:
Pro-resolving molecules may curb disease caused by viruses without altering the capacity of the host to deal with infection. AP1189 is a melanocortin receptor-biased agonist endowed with pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory activity. We evaluated the preclinical and early clinical effects of treatment with AP1189 in the context of COVID-19. C57BL/6j mice were infected intranasally with MHV-A59 or hK18-ACE2 mice with SARS-CoV-2. AP1189 (10&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg, BID, s.c.) was given to the animals from day 2 and parameters evaluated at day 5. Human PBMCs from health donors were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in presence or absence of AP1189 and production of cytokines quantified. In the clinical study, 6 patients were initially given AP1189 (100&#x2009;mg daily for 14&#x2009;days) and this was followed by a randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that enrolled 54 hospitalized COVID-19 patients needing oxygen support. The primary outcome was the time in days until respiratory recovery, defined as a SpO&#xa0;&#x2265;&#x2009;93% in ambient air. Treatment with AP1189 attenuated pulmonary inflammation in mice infected with MHV-A59 or SARS-CoV-2 and decreased the release of CXCL10, TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2; by human PBMCs. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients already taking glucocorticoids took a median time of 6&#xa0;days until respiratory recovery when given placebo versus 4&#xa0;days when taking AP1189 (P&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.017). Treatment with AP1189 was associated with less disease caused by beta-coronavirus infection both in mice and in humans. This is the first demonstration of the effects of a pro-resolving molecule in the context of severe infection in humans.
