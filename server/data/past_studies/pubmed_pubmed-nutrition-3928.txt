Study Title: Preliminary Support for the Use of Motivational Interviewing to Improve Parent/Adult Caregiver Behavior for Obesity and Cancer Prevention.

Study Summary:
Motivational interviewing (MI) is a promising behavioral intervention for improving parent and adult caregiver (PAC) health behavior for obesity and cancer prevention. This study explored the preliminary effects of MI from a registered dietitian (RDMI) within an obesity prevention intervention to promote PAC behavior change and positive proxy effects on children and the home environment. N = 36 PAC/child dyads from low-resource communities were enrolled in a randomized trial testing a 10-week obesity prevention intervention. Intervention dyads were offered RDMI sessions. Data were collected at baseline and post-intervention (PAC diet quality (Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), child skin carotenoids, home environment, and PAC ambivalence regarding improving diet). Results show that for every RDMI dose, PAC HEI scores increased (0.571 points,= 0.530), child skin carotenoid scores improved (1.315%,= 0.592), and the home food environment improved (3.559%,= 0.026). There was a significant positive relationship between RDMI dose and change in ambivalence (&#x3c1; = 0.533,= 0.007). Higher baseline ambivalence was associated with greater dose (&#x3c1; = -0.287,= 0.173). Thus, RDMI for PACs may improve diets among PACs who are otherwise ambivalent, with potential effects on the diets of their children and the home food environment. Such intervention strategies have the potential for greater effect, strengthening behavioral interventions targeting obesity and cancer.
