Study Title: Virtual reality for postsurgical pain management: An explorative randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool in a multimodal analgesic approach; however, evidence regarding virtual reality for postsurgical pain is limited. This study investigates the initial effectiveness and feasibility of self-administered virtual reality in postsurgical pain management. Patients reporting a postsurgical pain score &#x2265;4 were randomized for control or VR, stratified for 3 interventions with varying levels of immersion and interaction. Subjects were instructed to use virtual reality as add-on treatment at least 3 times a day for 10&#xa0;minutes on days 2 till 4 postoperatively. Primary outcome was the mean daily pain intensity. Results of pain scores were related to patient and intervention characteristics, to explore which characteristics interact with virtual reality effects. Secondary outcomes were analgesic use, anxiety, stress, and feasibility. One hundred patients were included in the analyses: 37 in the control group and 63 for VR. VR did not demonstrate a significant effect on self-reported pain scores (P&#xa0;= .43), nor were specific patient or intervention characteristics associated with greater VR effects. Analgesic usage did not differ between groups. However, there was a trend toward greater cumulative percentages of patients achieving a 30% pain reduction, and significantly lower daily experienced stress (P&#xa0;= .01) and anxiety (P&#xa0;= .03) levels in VR intervention groups. VR was used less than prescribed, mainly because of illness and pain. Adverse events included disorientation, nausea, and fatigue. This explorative study did not demonstrate initial effectiveness of VR as add-on pain treatment regarding pain and analgesic use; however, VR positively affected stress and anxiety. VR is safe and suitable for a wide target audience, and feasibility differed between interventions. Personalizing and improving VR technology may enhance its effectiveness.
