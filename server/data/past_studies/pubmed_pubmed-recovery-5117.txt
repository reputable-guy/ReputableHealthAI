Study Title: The Scalp Nerve Block Combined with Intercostal Nerve Block Improves Recovery After Deep Brain Stimulation in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To explore the effect of scalp nerve block (SNB) combined with intercostal nerve block (ICNB) on quality of recovery (QoR) after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial in which 88 patients with PD were randomly assigned to undergo SNB combined with ICNB (SNB group) or not (control group) before surgery. The primary outcome was the 15-item QoR (QoR-15) score 24&#xa0;h after surgery. The secondary outcomes included QoR-15 scores at 72&#xa0;h and 1 month after surgery, pain-related events, recovery events in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), duration of anesthesia and surgery, and nerve block-related adverse events. The QoR-15 score at 24&#xa0;h after surgery was significantly higher in SNB group than Control group: 122.0 &#xb1; 7.6 vs 113.5 &#xb1; 11.3 (= 0.006). SNB combined with ICNB improved QoR-15 scores at 72&#xa0;h (= 0.004) but not at 1 month after surgery (= 0.230). The SNB group was positively related to QoR-15 scores 24&#xa0;h after surgery (&#x3b2; = 8.92; 95% CI = 4.52~13.32) after adjusting for confounding variables. The numeric rating scale pain scores at PACU discharge and at 24&#xa0;h, intraoperative opioid consumption, rescue analgesic use, and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in SNB group were significantly lower than Control group (< 0.05). Preoperative SNB combined with ICNB improved QoR and analgesia after surgery, and reduced intraoperative opioid consumption and the incidence of PONV in patients with PD who underwent DBS.
