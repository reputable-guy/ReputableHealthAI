Study Title: Exposure to GLP-1 Receptor Agonist and Bariatric Surgery Use on Obesity Policy Support.

Study Summary:
Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) are a newer class of obesity medications that have garnered significant attention by the public and media. Media reports suggest that medical interventions such as GLP-1s are often perceived as weight loss "shortcuts." The present experimental research tested the effect of exposure to medical weight loss interventions on GLP-1 policy support, dependent on body mass index. A sample of 440 participants (Mage= 37, SD = 12.6) were randomly assigned to read about a woman who lost 15% of her body weight either with a GLP-1, bariatric surgery, or diet/exercise. Participants reported on beliefs that the woman took a weight loss "shortcut" and support for three policies expanding GLP-1 coverage. Exposure to a woman who lost weight with GLP-1 or bariatric surgery (vs. diet/exercise) led to higher GLP-1 policy support. However, such exposure was also indirectly associated with lower policy support, partially mediated by weight loss "shortcut" beliefs. This study provides evidence that exposure to medical weight loss interventions leads to higher GLP-1 policy support. Exposure may also, indirectly, lead to lower policy support due to beliefs that such interventions are shortcuts. Findings have implications for policymakers who are interested in how perceptions of medical weight loss interventions influence support for obesity treatments and related health policies.
