Study Title: Evaluating the efficacy of cranial electrotherapy stimulation in mitigating anxiety-induced cognitive deficits.

Study Summary:
Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) that has demonstrated potential to modulate neural activity in a manner that may be conducive to improved cognitive performance. While other forms of NIBS, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have received attention in the field as potential acute cognitive enhancers, CES remains relatively unexplored. The current study aimed to assess the efficacy of CES in improving acute cognitive performance under normal experimental conditions, as well as during sessions of induced situational anxiety (threat of shock or ToS). To study this question, participants completed a cognitive battery assessing processing speed and distinct aspects of executive functioning (working memory, inhibition, and task switching) in two separate sessions in which they received active and sham CES. Participants were randomly assigned to between subject groups of either situational anxiety (ToS) or control condition (no ToS). We predicted that active CES would improve performance on assessments of executive functioning (working memory, inhibition, and task switching) relative to sham CES under ToS. We did not find any significant effects of ToS, CES, or an interaction between ToS and CES for any measures of executive functioning or processing speed. These findings suggest that a single dose of CES does not enhance executive functioning or processing speed under normal conditions or during ToS.
