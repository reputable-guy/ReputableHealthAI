Study Title: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of purified anthocyanins on cognitive function in individuals at elevated risk for dementia: Analysis of inflammatory biomarkers toward personalized interventions.

Study Summary:
Dementia poses a significant global health challenge. Anthocyanins neutralize free radicals, modulate signaling pathways, inhibit pro-inflammatory genes, and suppress cytokine production and may thus have positive cognitive effects in people at increased risk of dementia. We aim to investigate the effects of purified anthocyanins on cognitive function in people at increased risk of dementia according to their inflammation status based on blood-based inflammatory biomarkers. This is a secondary analysis of a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Cluster analysis was performed to categorize two groups based on their individual inflammatory biomarker profile using multiplex sandwich ELISA for the quantitative measurement of cytokines. Descriptive statistics and longitudinal models assessed cognitive outcomes. The primary comparison was the group difference at week 24 based on a modified intention-to-treat analysis. Cluster analysis revealed two distinct inflammatory biomarker profiles. In Cluster 1 (high levels of inflammation biomarkers), anthocyanin treatment showed a statistically significant improvement on cognitive function compared to placebo at 24&#xa0;weeks. No significant differences were observed in Cluster 2 (low levels of inflammation biomarkers). The demographic characteristics, cognitive scores, and biomarker distributions were similar between treatment groups at baseline. However, cluster 1 exhibited higher BMI, diabetes prevalence, medication usage, and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Individuals with elevated levels of inflammation markers benefited from anthocyanin treatment to enhance cognitive performance, whereas those with lower levels did not. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of anthocyanins make them a promising intervention, and future prospective trials in people with increased inflammation are warranted.
