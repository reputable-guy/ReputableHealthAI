Study Title: Comparison of the effects of video conference and video-based home exercise on physical performance and body composition in older adult individuals.

Study Summary:
With the development of technology, remote access exercise interventions are frequently used in older adults. Although different technology methods are used in exercise, studies comparing these methods are limited. Based on this, the aim of the study is to compare the effect of exercise applied with video conference (VC) and video-based home exercise (VBHE) methods on physical performance, skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage, and body mass index (BMI) in older adults. Thirty older adult individuals between the ages of 65 and 75 years participated in the study. Participants were divided into 2 groups by computer-generated randomization (allocation ratio of 1:1). VC group calisthenic exercises were performed online with the physiotherapist using the WhatsApp program. The VBHE group did the same exercises by watching videos at home. Both programs spanned 6 weeks, 3 times a week. Before and after the intervention, chair sit-stand, 6-minute walk, time up and go, single leg stance, hand grip strength, shoulder flexion strength, and knee extension strength tests were performed on older adults to evaluate their physical performance. For body composition, skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage, and BMI were assessed using the Inbody device. It was observed that in both VC and VBHE groups, physical performance improved statistically significantly compared to the preintervention period (P <.05), while skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage, and BMI did not change (P &#x2c3;.05). When the groups were compared, it was concluded that the exercise program implemented with the VC method improved physical performance better than the VBHE method (P <.05), but there was no difference in skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage and BMI values (P &#x2c3;.05). It has been observed that a 6-week calisthenic exercise intervention implemented through technology methods such as VC and VBHE is a useful method for the improvement of the physical performance of older adults. However, it was concluded that the VC method is a more effective method than the VBHE method. It is predicted that the lack of improvement in body composition is due to the intensity and duration of exercise.
