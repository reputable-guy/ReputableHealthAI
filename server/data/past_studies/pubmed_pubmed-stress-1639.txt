Study Title: A Pilot Randomized Control Trial of the Striving Towards EmPowerment and Medication Adherence (STEP-AD) Intervention for Black Women Living with HIV.

Study Summary:
Black women living with HIV (BWLWH) face adversities associated with lower HIV medication adherence, viral non-suppression, and mental health symptoms (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) such as trauma/violence, racism, HIV-related discrimination/stigma, and gender-related stressors. We developed the first intervention based in cognitive behavioral therapy and culturally congruent coping for BWLWH to increase medication adherence and decrease PTSD symptoms by enhancing resilience, self-care, engagement in care, and coping for trauma, racism, HIV-related discrimination/stigma, and gender-related stressors. A pilot randomized control trial was conducted with BWLWH and histories of trauma who were at risk for their HIV viral load remaining or becoming detectable (i.e., below 80% medication adherence, detectable viral load in the past year, and/or missed HIV-related appointments). 119 BWLWH were assessed at baseline and 70 met inclusion criteria, completed one session of Life-Steps adherence counseling, and were randomized to either nine sessions of STEP-AD (Striving Towards EmPowerment and Medication Adherence) or ETAU (enhanced treatment as usual consisting of biweekly check-ins). Women completed a post intervention follow up assessment (3&#xa0;months post baseline) and 3-month post intervention follow-up (6&#xa0;months post baseline). Via STATA the difference-in-difference methodology with mixed models compared STEP-AD to ETAU on changes in outcomes over time. BWLWH in STEP-AD compared to E-TAU had significantly higher ART adherence (estimate&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.36 p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045) and lower likelihood of being clinically diagnosed with PTSD (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;.07, estimate&#x2009;=&#x2009;- 2.66, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) as well as borderline significance on higher CD4 count (estimate&#x2009;=&#x2009;161.26, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Our findings suggest preliminary efficacy of STEP-AD in improving ART adherence, mental health, and immune function.
