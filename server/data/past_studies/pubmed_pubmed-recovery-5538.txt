Study Title: Impact of Preoperative Gum Chewing on Postoperative Anti-Emetic Use in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery for Benign Ovarian Masses: A Prospective, Single-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common issue for females undergoing gynecological surgeries, including those assisted by robotic systems. Despite available prophylactic measures, the incidence of PONV remains high, negatively impacting recovery and increasing healthcare costs. This study evaluates whether preoperative gum chewing reduces the need for anti-emetic drugs in females undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian mass.: This prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial enrolled 92 adult females scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to treat benign ovarian mass. Following exclusions, the remaining participants were randomly assigned to either a gum-chewing group or a no-gum-chewing group. The gum-chewing group chewed sugar-free gum for 15 min in the holding area before surgery. The primary outcome measured was the need for anti-emetics to control PONV during the first hour in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes included the number of anti-emetic requests. No preemptive anti-emetics were administered during surgery.: Out of the initial 92 patients, 88 were included in the final analysis, with 44 in each group. The incidence of PONV requiring anti-emetics in the PACU was significantly lower in the gum-chewing group (79.5%) compared to the no-gum-chewing group (95.5%). Additionally, the number of anti-emetic requests was higher in the no-gum-chewing group. No postoperative complications such as tooth or jaw pain/injury or gastric content regurgitation were reported.: Preoperative gum chewing for 15 min immediately before surgery significantly reduced the incidence of PONV in females undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian mass. This simple, non-pharmacological intervention improved patient comfort and reduced the need for anti-emetic medications without any adverse effects. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to develop guidelines for incorporating preoperative gum chewing into clinical practice.
