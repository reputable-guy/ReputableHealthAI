Study Title: Caffeine and modafinil modulate the effects of sleep deprivation on thalamic resting-state functional connectivity: A double-blind pilot study.

Study Summary:
Studies have found that the use of clinically approved caffeine and modafinil can alleviate cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation (SD) to some extent. However, the neural mechanisms by which these two cognitive enhancers work to counteract the effects of SD on cognitive impairment remain unclear. A double-blind within-subjects experiment using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was designed. Participants underwent three 36-h SD trials, each of which involved taking 200&#xa0;mg of caffeine, modafinil, or placebo at the 28th and 32&#xa0;nd&#xa0;h of SD. Sixteen subregions of the thalamus were selected as the regions of interest and changes in functional connectivity (FC) between the thalamus and the other brain regions were explored after the participants took caffeine or modafinil. The subjective sleepiness of the participants increased with the duration of SD. compared with placebo, modafinil and caffeine had insignificant effects on wakefulness or sleepiness. However, in terms of neural FC, we found varying degrees of attenuation or enhancement of the FC between the thalamus and other regions. Taking caffeine during SD weakened the FC between the right rostral temporal thalamus (rTtha) subregion and the left lingual gyrus compared with placebo. Caffeine enhanced the FC between three subregions of the thalamus, namely the left sensory thalamus, the left rTtha, and the right lateral pre-frontal thalamus, and the right inferior temporal, left orbitofrontal, and right superior occipital gyris. Modafinil weakened the FC between the right posterior parietal thalamus and left middle temporal gyrus, and enhanced the FC between the left medial pre-frontal thalamus, left rTtha, and right occipital thalamus and left middle frontal gyrus. After 36&#xa0;h of total SD, modafinil and caffeine administration enhanced or attenuated the time-domain correlations between various subregions of the thalamus and brain regions of the frontal and temporal lobes in healthy adults, compared with placebo. These results provide valuable evidence for further unraveling the neuropharmacological mechanisms of caffeine and modafinil, as well as important insights for exploring effective pharmacological intervention strategies against SD.
