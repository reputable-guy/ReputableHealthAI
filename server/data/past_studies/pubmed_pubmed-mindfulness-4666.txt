Study Title: Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Therapy on Posttraumatic Growth and Quality of Life in Patients With Breast Cancer Under Early Chemotherapy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Posttraumatic growth (PTG) in patients with breast cancer has been reported. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been found to be effective in improving the psychological well-being during cancer care. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MBSR on the levels of PTG, perceived social support, and quality of life. A sample of 101 participants who experienced early chemotherapy enrolled in an MBSR group (n = 50) and a routine care group (n = 51) for 8 weeks. Their postintervention data were combined with preintervention data through a bundle of questionnaires reporting levels of PTG, perceived social support, and quality of life. MBSR showed the prominent validity in raising the levels of PTG and increasing in perceived social support and quality of life from pre- to posttreatment. MBSR improved the levels of PTG, perceived social support, and quality of life in patients with breast cancer in early chemotherapy. In conclusion, MBSR may help to optimize the positive psychological processes that will be targeted to maximize the efficacy of treatment for future cancer survivors.
