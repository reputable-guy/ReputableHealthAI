Study Title: Differential posttraumatic stress disorder symptom cluster response to stellate ganglion block: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Empirically supported treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exist, but research suggests these therapies are less effective, acceptable, and feasible to deliver to active duty service members (SMs) compared to civilians. Stellate ganglion block (SGB) procedure, in which a local anesthetic is injected around the cervical sympathetic chain or stellate ganglion to temporarily inhibit sympathetic nervous activity, is gaining popularity as an alternative PTSD treatment in military settings. However, it is unknown whether certain PTSD symptoms are more responsive to SGB than others. The current study involved a secondary analysis of data collected from a previous randomized controlled trial of SGB compared to sham (normal saline) injection (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;113 SMs). PTSD symptoms were assessed via clinical interview and self-report at baseline and 8 weeks post-SGB or sham. Logistic regression analyses showed that the marked alterations in arousal and reactivity PTSD symptom cluster demonstrated the greatest symptom severity reductions after SGB, relative to sham. The reexperiencing cluster also showed pronounced response to SGB in clinician-rated but not self-reported outcomes. Post-hoc item-level analyses suggested that arousal and reactivity cluster findings were driven by reductions in hypervigilance, concentration difficulties, and sleep disturbance, whereas clinician-rated reexperiencing cluster findings were driven by reductions in physiological reactions to trauma cues, emotional reactions to trauma cues, and intrusions. Our findings align with a burgeoning literature positioning SGB as a potential novel or adjunctive PTSD treatment. Results could guide future hypothesis-driven research on mediators of therapeutic change during SGB for PTSD symptoms in SMs.
