Study Title: An Online Mindfulness Program for Teachers: A Feasibility Study of the DeStress Monday at School Program.

Study Summary:
Stress has deleterious effects on teachers' well-being and interactions with students. While in-person mindfulness programs have demonstrated benefits for teachers' mental health, in-person classes are often not feasible due to teachers' busy schedules. This study assessed four components of feasibility (implementation, demand, acceptability, and limited-efficacy testing) for an online mindfulness intervention for teachers. A volunteer sample of 50 primary school teachers was recruited across three urban public schools and was&#xa0;offered a 9-week online mindfulness program (DeStress Monday at School). The program provided weekly mindfulness practices for (1) self-care and (2) classroom use to promote teacher and student stress management. Surveys and focus group discussions assessed program feasibility. Paired-tests were used to evaluate pre-post changes in teacher well-being. Most participants had no technical problems, providing general support for implementation. Support for program demand was mixed; while 85% of participants used practices at least once, some never used practices, and over half used practices only 1-3 times. Those who used practices generally rated their acceptability favorably. Qualitative analyses showed significant pre-post improvements in work-related and overall stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and sleep; those who used practices reported more benefits than those who did not. Qualitative data corroborated these findings, with teachers describing improved stress- and emotion-management following program use. Our findings suggest mindfulness can be delivered online to teachers and may enhance mental health and wellness. Next steps include conducting more rigorous research with a control condition to better understand potential program impact. This study is not preregistered.
