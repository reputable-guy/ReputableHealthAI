Study Title: The Impact of User Engagement With Exposure Components on Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms in an mHealth Mobile App: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Mobile mental health apps are a cost-effective option for managing mental health problems, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The efficacy of mobile health (mHealth) apps depends on engagement with the app, but few studies have examined how users engage with different features of mHealth apps for PTSD. This study aims to examine the relationship between app engagement indices and PTSD symptom reduction using data from an unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial of "Renew" (Vertical Design), an exposure-based app for PTSD with and without coaching support. Because exposure is an effective approach for treating PTSD, we expected that engagement with exposure activities would be positively related to symptom reduction, over and above overall app usage. Participants were veterans (N=69) with clinically significant PTSD symptoms who were recruited online using Facebook advertisements and invited to use the Renew app as often as they wanted over a 6-week period. Participants completed screening and assessments online but provided informed consent, toured the app, and completed feedback interviews via telephone. We assessed users' self-reported PTSD symptoms before and after a 6-week intervention period and collected app usage data using a research-instrumented dashboard. To examine overall app engagement, we used data on the total time spent in the app, the number of log-in days, and the number of points that the user gained in the app. To examine engagement with exposure components, we used data on total time spent completing exposure activities (both in vivo and imaginal), the number of in vivo exposure activities completed, and the number of characters written in response to imaginal exposure prompts. We used hierarchical regression analyses to test the effect of engagement indices on change in PTSD symptoms. Usage varied widely. Participants spent an average of 166.09 (SD 156.52) minutes using Renew, over an average of 14.7 (SD 10.71) mean log-in days. Engagement with the exposure components of the app was positively associated with PTSD symptom reduction (F6,62=2.31; P=.04). Moreover, this relationship remained significant when controlling for overall engagement with the app (&#x394;F3,62=4.42; P=.007). The number of characters written during imaginal exposure (&#x3b2;=.37; P=.009) and the amount of time spent completing exposure activities (&#x3b2;=.36; P=.03) were significant contributors to the model. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a relationship between symptom improvement and engagement with the active therapeutic components of an mHealth app (ie, exposure) for PTSD. This relationship held when controlling for overall app use, which suggests that it was engagement with exposure, specifically, that was associated with symptom change. Future work to identify ways of promoting greater engagement with self-guided exposure may help improve the effectiveness of mHealth apps for PTSD.
