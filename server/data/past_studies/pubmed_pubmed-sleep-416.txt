Study Title: Effects of Auricular Acupressure on Nurses' Perceived Stress, Sleep Quality, and Presenteeism: A Single-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The physical and psychological health management of nurses is very important not only for individual nurses but also for organizations and patients. However, nurses are exposed to high stress, sleep problems, and high presenteeism. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of auricular acupressure (AA) on nurses' stress, sleep problems, and presenteeism. This randomized controlled trial encompassed 60 nurses divided into an experimental group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) and a control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30). Auricular acupressure using AA stickers with small magnets attached was performed in the experimental group, and a placebo AA using simple AA stickers (without the small magnets) was performed in the control group. The treatment lasted 7&#xa0;weeks. To confirm the results, stress, sleep quality, and presenteeism were measured at pre- and posttest. There was a statistically significant difference in scores for sleep quality ( t =&#xa0;-1.98, P =&#xa0;.047), health problems ( z =&#xa0;-2.38, P =&#xa0;.017), and work impairment ( t =&#xa0;-4.46, P <&#xa0;.001) between the experimental and control groups at posttest. Auricular acupressure increased sleep quality scores and decreased presenteeism. Auricular acupressure using AA stickers with small magnets attached was effective in improving sleep quality and reducing presenteeism in nurses.
