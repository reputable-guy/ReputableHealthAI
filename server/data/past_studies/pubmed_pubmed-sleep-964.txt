Study Title: Investigating the subjective and objective efficacy of a cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)-based smartphone app on sleep: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Due to insufficient treatment options for insomnia, effective solutions are urgently needed. We evaluated the effects of a CBT-I-based app combining sleep training with subjective and objective sleep monitoring on (i) sleep and (ii) subjective-objective sleep discrepancies (SOSD). Fifty-seven volunteers (20-76&#x2009;years; M&#x2009;=&#x2009;45.67&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;16.38; 39 female) suffering from sleep problems were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28) or a waitlist control group (CG, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29). During the 6-week app phase, the EG used the CBT-I-based programme and a heart rate sensor for daily sleep monitoring and -feedback, while the CG used sleep monitoring only. Sleep was measured (i) subjectively via questionnaires (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), (ii) objectively via ambulatory polysomnography (PSG), and (iii) continuously via heart-rate sensor and sleep diaries. Data revealed interactions for ISI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003, &#x19e;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.11) and PSQI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.050, &#x19e;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05), indicating training-specific improvements in EG, yet not in CG. While PSG-derived outcomes appear to be less training-specific, a tendential reduction in wake after sleep onset (WASO) was found in EG (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.061, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.55). Regarding changes in SOSD, the results indicate improvements during the app phase (EG) for sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and WASO (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.022, d&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.46); for total sleep time both groups showed a SOSD reduction. The findings indicate beneficial effects of a novel smartphone app on sleep and SOSD. More scientific evaluation of such digital programmes is needed to ultimately help in reducing the gap in non-pharmacological insomnia treatment.
