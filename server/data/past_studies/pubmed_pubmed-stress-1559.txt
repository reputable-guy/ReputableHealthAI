Study Title: Burnout among medical residents, coping mechanisms and the perceived impact on patient care in a low/ middle income country.

Study Summary:
Burnout is a syndrome that result from chronic workplace stress and it characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishments. Studies report higher burnout levels in medical personnel compared to the general population. Workplace burnout has been directly linked to medical errors and negative coping strategies such as substance abuse. The aims of this study were to assess the level of burnout in medical residents, evaluate their impressions about coping mechanisms and assess perceived impact on patient care in a low/ middle income country setting. This was a cross sectional, mixed methods survey carried out at Aga Khan University, Nairobi Kenya. The Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey was used to assess the level of burnout. High-risk scores for each subscale are defined as >&#x2009;27 in emotional exhaustion, >&#x2009;10 in depersonalization, and <&#x2009;33 in personal accomplishment. Overall high risk of burnout was defined as high-risk scores in 2 or more of the 3 categories. Categorical variables were analysed using descriptive statistics and reported as frequency counts and corresponding percentages. Chi-square test was applied to test for association of burnout and the categorical variables. P value of <&#x2009;0.05 was considered statistically significant. To assess the impressions on patient care and evaluate the coping mechanisms employed in the context of burnout residents participated in four focus group discussions reaching thematic saturation. 95 out of 120 residents consented to participate in the study, 47.3% of whom had a high risk of burnout. A significant association was found between gender and burnout risk with more female residents having high risk of burnout compared to their male counterparts; 58.0% and 35.6% respectively (P value 0.029). Residents in paediatrics and child health had the greatest risk of burnout (8 out of 10) compared to those in other programmes (P value of 0.01). Thematic analysis from focus group discussions revealed that main sources of stress included departmental conflict and struggle to balance work and other aspects of life. All focus group discussions revealed that burnout and stress are associated with negative coping mechanisms. Respondents reported that when under stress, they felt more likely to make medical errors. This study reported high risk of burnout among post graduate residents which is consistent with other global studies. The sources of stress cited by residents were mostly related to the workplace and many perceived sub-optimal patients care resulted from burnout. This highlights a need for preventive measures such as wellness programs within the training programmes. Not applicable.
