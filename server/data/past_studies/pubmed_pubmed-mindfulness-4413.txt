Study Title: Randomized trial of mindfulness- and reappraisal-based regulation of craving training among daily cigarette smokers.

Study Summary:
Craving predicts smoking, yet existing interventions may not adequately target regulation of craving. We evaluated two versions of regulation of craving-training (ROC-T), a computerized intervention with intensive practice of strategies when exposed to smoking-related images. Ninety-two nicotine-dependent daily smokers were randomized to mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) ROC-T focusing on mindful acceptance, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) ROC-T focusing on reappraisal or no intervention control. The ROC task was administered pre- and postintervention to assess changes in cue-induced craving and mindfulness- and reappraisal-based regulation of craving. MBT and CBT-versus control-showed significantly greater reductions in smoking during the intervention phase (baseline to Week 4), corresponding to large (= -1.08, 95% CI [-1.64, -0.52]) and medium-to-large effect sizes (= -0.69, 95% CI [-1.22, -0.15]), respectively. During follow-up (Week 4-16), CBT showed significant increases in smoking, whereas MBT and control did not. For the entire study (baseline to Week 16), MBT showed significantly greater reductions in smoking compared to control (= -1.6, 95% CI [-2.56, -0.66]) but CBT was not significantly different than control (= -0.82, 95% CI [-1.77, 0.13]). There were no effects on smoking when directly comparing MBT and CBT. Quit rates were low across the sample, with no difference among conditions. MBT and CBT-versus control-significantly reduced cue-induced craving. CBT (but not MBT)-versus control-significantly improved reappraisal-based regulation of craving. Both MBT and CBT-versus control-significantly improved mindfulness-based regulation of craving. MBT- and CBT-ROC-T may reduce cue-induced craving and smoking, and MBT may be more durable than CBT.
