Study Title: Misinformation and Disinformation in Food Science and Nutrition: Impact on Practice.

Study Summary:
Food and nutrition are popular topics in the media and on social media. The ubiquity of social media has created new opportunities for qualified or credentialed experts in the scientific community to connect with clients and the public. It has also created challenges. Health and wellness gurus, or self-proclaimed experts, utilize social media platforms to garner attention through compelling narratives, build audience followings, and influence public opinion by sharing (often) misleading information about food and nutrition. The consequence of this can be the perpetuation of misinformation, which not only undermines a well-functioning democracy but also diminishes support for policies that are science or evidence based. Nutrition practitioners, clinician scientists, researchers, communicators, educators, and food experts need to encourage and model critical thinking (CT) to participate in our world of mass information and mitigate misinformation. These experts can play a vital role in the evaluation of information about food and nutrition against the body of evidence. This article explores the role of CT and ethics of practice in the context of misinformation and disinformation by providing a framework for engaging with clients and offering a checklist for ethical practice.
