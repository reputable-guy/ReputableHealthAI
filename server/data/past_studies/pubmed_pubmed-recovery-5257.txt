Study Title: Effect of Ultrasound-Guided External Oblique Intercostal Block on Postoperative Recovery After Subxiphoid Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Thymectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Severe postoperative pain can occur after subxiphoid video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy (SVATT), affecting the quality of postoperative recovery. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ultrasound-guided external oblique intercostal (EOI) block on recovery after SVATT. A total of 60 patients undergoing SVATT were randomly divided into the EOI group (group E, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) and the control group (group C, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). Group E underwent ultrasound-guided bilateral EOI block at the 6th rib level and was injected 20&#x2009;mL of 0.375% ropivacaine on each side. Group C was injected with 20&#x2009;mL of 0.9% saline at the same site. After the operation, both groups received a patient-controlled intravenous analgesic (PCIA) pump. The 15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scores were recorded at 24&#x2009;hours before surgery (T0), 24&#x2009;hours after surgery (T3), and 48&#x2009;hours after surgery (T4). The sufentanil usage in the first 24&#x2009;hours postoperatively, the remifentanil dosage during surgery, the time of first pressing PCIA, and the cases of rescue analgesia were recorded. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores of patients at 6 (T1), 12 (T2), 24 (T3), and 48&#x2009;hours (T4) after an operation during rest and coughing were recorded. The dermatomes of the sensory plane, block complications in group E, and the incidence of other postoperative adverse reactions in both groups were also recorded. Compared with group C, the QoR-15 scores of patients were significantly higher at T3 and T4 in the group E. The VAS scores were significantly lower at T1, T2, and T3 during rest and coughing in the group E. The sufentanil usage in the first 24&#x2009;hours postoperatively, the remifentanil dosage during surgery, and the cases of rescue analgesia were significantly lower in group E, and the time of first pressing PCIA was significantly increased in group E (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). Ultrasound-guided EOI block can be safely used in patients undergoing SVATT, which can improve the quality of postoperative recovery and reduce postoperative pain.
