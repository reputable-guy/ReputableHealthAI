Study Title: Effects of a personalized nutrition program on cardiometabolic health: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Large variability exists in people's responses to foods. However, the efficacy of personalized dietary advice for health remains understudied. We compared a personalized dietary program (PDP) versus general advice (control) on cardiometabolic health using a randomized clinical trial. The PDP used food characteristics, individual postprandial glucose and triglyceride (TG) responses to foods, microbiomes and health history, to produce personalized food scores in an 18-week app-based program. The control group received standard care dietary advice (US Department of Agriculture Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025) using online resources, check-ins, video lessons and a leaflet. Primary outcomes were serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and TG concentrations at baseline and at 18 weeks. Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;347), aged 41-70 years and generally representative of the average US population, were randomized to the PDP (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;177) or control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;170). Intention-to-treat analysis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;347) between groups showed significant reduction in TGs (mean difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.13&#x2009;mmol&#x2009;l; log-transformed 95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.07 to -0.01, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016). Changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not significant. There were improvements in secondary outcomes, including body weight, waist circumference, HbA1c, diet quality and microbiome (beta-diversity) (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), particularly in highly adherent PDP participants. However, blood pressure, insulin, glucose, C-peptide, apolipoprotein A1 and B, and postprandial TGs did not differ between groups. No serious intervention-related adverse events were reported. Following a personalized diet led to some improvements in cardiometabolic health compared to standard dietary advice. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05273268 .
