Study Title: Long-term functioning outcomes are predicted by cognitive symptoms in working patients with major depressive disorder treated with vortioxetine: results from the AtWoRC study.

Study Summary:
AtWoRC (Assessment in Work productivity and the Relationship with Cognitive symptoms) was an interventional, open-label, Canadian study (NCT02332954) designed to assess the association between cognitive symptoms and workplace productivity in working patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) receiving vortioxetine. Eligible patients with MDD received vortioxetine (10-20 mg/day) and were assessed over 52 weeks at visits emulating a real-life setting (n = 199). Partial correlation between changes in patient-reported cognitive symptoms (20-item Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression; PDQ-D-20) and workplace productivity (Work Limitations Questionnaire; WLQ) was assessed at 12 and 52 weeks. Additional assessments included depression severity, cognitive performance, and patient-reported functioning. Structural equations model (SEM) analyses assessed causal relationships between changes in measures of cognition and functioning over time, adjusted for improvements in depressive symptoms. Statistically significant improvements in all outcomes from baseline to week 52 were seen in the overall population and both subgroups (first treatment and switch). Response and remission rates were 77% and 56%, respectively. Improvements in PDQ-D-20 and WLQ productivity loss scores at weeks 12 and 52 were significantly correlated. SEM analyses found patient-rated cognitive symptoms (PDQ-D-20) at weeks 12 and 26 were significantly predictive (p < 0.05) of patient-reported functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale) at the subsequent visit. Depression severity and objectively measured cognitive performance did not significantly predict functional outcomes at any timepoint. These results demonstrate the long-term benefits of vortioxetine treatment in working patients with MDD and emphasize the strong association between cognitive symptoms and functioning in a real-world setting.
