Study Title: Validation of Total Water Intake from the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Recall, 4-d Food Records, and a Food Frequency Questionnaire Using Doubly Labeled Water.

Study Summary:
Although prior evidence indicates that water intake is important for health, the ability to accurately measure community-dwelling intake is limited. Only a few studies have evaluated self-reported water intake against an objective recovery biomarker. The aim was to compare preformed water intakes (all sources including food) by multiple Automated Self-Administered 24-h recalls (ASA24s), food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), and 4-d food records (4DFRs) against a recovery biomarker, doubly labeled water (DLW), to assess measurement error. Over 1 y, 1082 women and men (50%), aged 50 to 74 y, were asked to complete 6 ASA24s, 2 FFQs, 2 unweighted 4DFRs, and an administration of DLW (n = 686). Geometric means of water intake by self-report tools were compared with DLW. Attenuation factors and correlation coefficients between self-reported and the recovery biomarker (DLW) were estimated. Mean water intakes by DLW were 2777 mL/d (interquartile range, 2350 to 3331) in women and 3243 mL/d (interquartile range, 2720 to 3838) in men. Compared with DLW, water intake was underestimated by 18% to 31% on ASA24s and 43% to 44% on 4DFRs. Estimated geometric means from FFQs differed from DLW by -1% to +13%. For a single ASA24, FFQ, and 4DFR, attenuation factors were 0.28, 0.27, and 0.32 and correlation coefficients were 0.46, 0.48, and 0.49, respectively. Repeated use of 6 ASA24s, 2 FFQs, and 2 4DFRs improved attenuation factors to 0.43, 0.32, and 0.39 and correlation coefficients to 0.58, 0.53, and 0.54, respectively. FFQs may better estimate population means for usual water intake compared with ASA24 and 4DFR. Similar attenuation factors and correlation coefficients across all self-report tools indicate that researchers have 3 feasible options if the goal is understanding intake-disease relationships. The findings are useful for planning future nutrition studies that set policy priorities for populations and to understand the health impact of water. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03268577.
