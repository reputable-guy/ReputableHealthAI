Study Title: Bridging Total Force Fitness and Whole Health in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.

Study Summary:
The Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prevention project is a VA-DoD initiative, supported by the Joint Incentive Fund. The goal of the project is to create an innovative, 3D virtual space within the VA-Virtual Medical Center (VA-VMC) platform that provides Veterans and Active Duty Service Members with educational resources on the prevention of CVD. The Performance Health and Wellness Center is a new center within the VA-VMC. The space enables users to explore information and actionable resources on various risk factors related to CVD through independent and provider-led instruction, using a personalized 3D avatar. Partners of DoD and VA envision users engaging with the learning resources securely and with a sense of anonymity, which can foster self-directed learning and healthy behavior change. The DoD is particularly invested in promoting CVD prevention through the early adoption of positive health behaviors and the Total Force Fitness framework. The VA team is also committed to supporting users by providing professionally led classes and support groups on various CVD risk factors like tobacco, diabetes, nutrition, and exercise. This project is a unique and important collaboration during a time when telehealth and telemedicine services are in greater demand. The VA-VMC advances accessible, relevant, and evidence-based educational services for DoD and VA populations, and the Performance Health and Wellness Center, itself, presents Total Force Fitness concepts and a whole-person care approach while encouraging users to be actively involved in shared decision-making with their health care providers.
