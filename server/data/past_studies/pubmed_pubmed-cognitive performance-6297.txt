Study Title: Effect of Resistance Exercise Orders on Health Parameters in Trained Older Women: A Randomized Crossover Trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to compare the effects of four resistance exercise orders on muscular strength, body composition, functional fitness, cardiovascular risk factors, and mental health parameters in trained older women. The intervention lasted 63 wk. Sixty-one physically independent women (>60 yr) after completing a 12-wk resistance training (RT) preconditioning phase were randomized into four different exercise orders groups to perform 12 wk of RT: multijoint to single-joint and upper- to lower-body, single-joint to multijoint and upper- to lower-body, multijoint to single-joint and lower- to upper-body, and single-joint to multijoint and lower- to upper-body. This was followed by a 12-wk detraining period and another 12-wk RT in which exercise orders were crossed over between MJ-SJ and SJ-MJ conditions. Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), muscular strength (one-repetition maximum tests), functional fitness (gait speed, walking agility, 30-s chair stand, and 6-min walk tests), cardiovascular risk factors (glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, advanced oxidation protein product, total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter, and nitric oxide), depressive (Geriatric Depression Scale) and anxiety symptoms (Beck Anxiety Inventory), and cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making, verbal fluency, and Stroop test) were analyzed. After the final training period, all groups presented significant improvements ( P < 0.05) in almost all analyzed variables (muscular strength, body composition, functional tests, blood biomarkers, and mental health parameters), without significant difference among exercise orders. Our results suggest that RT exercise orders in which MJ, SJ, upper, or lower-body exercises are performed first have similar effects on health parameters in trained older women.
