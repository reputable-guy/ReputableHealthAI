Study Title: The Mediterranean Diet in Pregnancy: Implications for Maternal Brain Morphometry in a Secondary Analysis of the IMPACT BCN Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
A Mediterranean diet has positive effects on the brain in mid-older adults; however, there is scarce information on pregnant individuals. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a structured Mediterranean diet intervention on the cortical structure of the maternal brain during pregnancy. This study was a secondary analysis of the IMPACT BCN, a randomized clinical trial with 1221 high-risk pregnant women randomly allocated into three groups at 19-23 weeks of gestation: Mediterranean diet intervention, a mindfulness-based stress reduction program, or usual care. Maternal brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed during the third trimester of pregnancy in a random subgroup of participants. For this study, data from the Mediterranean diet and usual groups were analyzed. Maternal dietary intake, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and metabolite biomarkers were evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire, a 17-item dietary screener and plasma/urine samples, respectively. The cluster-wise analysis showed that the Mediterranean diet group participants (= 34) had significantly larger surface areas in the right precuneus (90%CI: <0.0001-0.0004,< 0.001) and left superior parietal (90%CI: 0.026-0.033,= 0.03) lobules compared to the usual care group participants (= 37). A larger right precuneus area was associated with high improvements in adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a high intake of walnuts and high concentrations of urinary hydroxytyrosol. A larger left superior parietal area was associated with a high intake of walnuts and high concentrations of urinary hydroxytyrosol. The promotion of a Mediterranean diet during pregnancy has a significant effect on maternal brain structure.
