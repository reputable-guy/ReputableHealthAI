Study Title: Motivational Interviewing improves postoperative nutrition goals within the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS&#xae;) pathway in elective bowel surgery - A randomized clinical pilot trial.

Study Summary:
Exploration whether Motivational Interviewing (MI) could be learned and implemented with ease within a surgical in-hospital setting and whether participation in the intervention led to significantly higher compliance with ERAS&#xae;-recommended protein intake goals. The individual healing process of many patients is delayed because they fail to cover their calorie requirement, which could be counteracted by a patient-centered conversational intervention that is new in perioperative practice. This patient-blinded pilot-RCT included 60 patients (&#x2265;18 years) following the certified ERAS&#xae; bowel protocol for colorectal surgery between March and August 2022. Five perioperative MI interventions were conducted by two health employees certified to perform MI. Key endpoints were the number of protein shakes drunk, calories of proteins ingested and overall calorie intake. A total of 60 patients (34 men [56.7%]; mean [SD] age, 60.7 [13.3] years) were randomized. MI patient-group had significantly higher protein shake intake on all postoperative days except day 3. For days 0-3 MI group drank significantly more shakes overall (median 5.5 vs. 2.0; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004) and consumed more calories (median 1650.0 vs. 600.0&#xa0;kcal; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004) and proteins (median 110.0 vs. 40.0&#xa0;g; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005). Total calorie intake for each day by shakes and dietary intake was significantly higher in the MI-intervention group on day 2 (mean 1772.3 vs. 1358.9&#xa0;kcal; P&#xa0;= 0.03). MI may contribute to improve compliance with nutritional goals in the certified ERAS&#xae; protocol by increasing protein and calorie intake. The findings suggest further investigation of MI to help patients achieve their perioperative nutrition goals in different clinical settings.
