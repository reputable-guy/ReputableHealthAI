Study Title: Exercise intervention in middle-aged and elderly individuals with insomnia improves sleep and restores connectivity in the motor network.

Study Summary:
Exercise is a potential treatment to improve sleep quality in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Understanding exercise-induced changes in functional plasticity of brain circuits that underlie improvements in sleep among middle-aged and older adults can inform treatment of sleep problems. The aim of the study is to identify the effects of a 12-week exercise program on sleep quality and brain functional connectivity in middle-aged and older adults with insomnia. The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR2000033652). We recruited 84 healthy sleepers and 85 individuals with insomnia. Participants with insomnia were assigned to receive either a 12-week exercise intervention or were placed in a 12-week waitlist control condition. Thirty-seven middle-aged and older adults in the exercise group and 30 in the waitlist group completed both baseline and week 12 assessments. We found that middle-aged and older adults with insomnia showed significantly worse sleep quality than healthy sleepers. At the brain circuit level, insomnia patients showed decreased connectivity in the widespread motor network. After exercise intervention, self-reported sleep was increased in the exercise group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) compared to that in the waitlist group. We also found increased functional connectivity of the motor network with the cerebellum in the exercise group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Moreover, we observed significant correlations between improvement in subjective sleep indices and connectivity changes within the motor network. We highlight exercise-induced improvement in sleep quality and functional plasticity of the aging brain.
