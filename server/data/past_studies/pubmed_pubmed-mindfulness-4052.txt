Study Title: The impact of extremely brief meditation and brief mindfulness interventions on assisted reproductive technologies success rates: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of extremely brief meditation (EBMI) or brief mindfulness interventions (Brief MI) on pregnancy rate in women undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). This is a prospective, three-armed, randomized controlled trial with women undergoing ART cycle, age ranging from 18 to 50 years. In the day of embryo transfer, the patients randomized to Brief MI group received a 15-minute audio of mindfulness. They were instructed to practice it daily, starting from the day of embryo transfer to the day of the pregnancy test, leading to a total of 180-210 minutes. Women randomized to EBMI met once a week during the waiting time between the embryo transfer and pregnancy test day in the same virtual room with a meditator instructor for 40 minutes, totalizing two sessions (80 minutes). The pregnancy rate was assessed via a blood test to measure hCG performed 2 weeks after embryo transfer. A total of 68 women aged 37.5 &#xb1; 4.3y were included (EBMI, n = 24; Brief MI, n = 22 and CG, n = 22). Pearson's Chi-square test and Student's t-test for independent samples showed no significant differences between intervention and control groups. Both EBMI and Brief MI had no significant effect on pregnancy rate in women undergoing ART. This randomized control trial revealed that the extremely brief meditation (EBMI) or self-managed brief mindfulness intervention (Brief MI) had no significant effect on pregnancy rates in infertile women undergoing ART cycles.
