Study Title: The effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on the Clinical efficacy and psychological state in patients with functional dyspepsia.

Study Summary:
To observe the clinical therapeutic effect and mental state of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). In this study, 80 patients suffering from FD in an outpatient clinic were enrolled from January to December 2020. Patients were randomly allocated into the control group (conventional treatment) and observation group (MBCT treatment). Patients in the control group were prescribed rabeprazole and mosapiride, and patients in the observation group were given MBCT therapy in addition to the above drugs. After treatment for 8&#x2009;weeks, the changes in gastrointestinal symptom scores, anxiety, depression, mindfulness and sleep quality and gastric emptying testing were compared between these two groups. The observation group showed strikingly lower gastrointestinal symptom scores, SAS, SDS, PSQI, and SCL-90 scale scores, and higher FFMQ scale scores than the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was no conspicuous change in gastric emptying monitoring (&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). MBCT therapy can improve patients' gastrointestinal symptoms, attenuate their anxiety and depression levels, and ameliorate their sleep quality.
