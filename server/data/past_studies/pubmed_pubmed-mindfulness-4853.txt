Study Title: Effect of Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction on Well-being and Views on Risk-Reducing Surgery Among Women With BRCA Variants in Israel: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
The high risk for breast and ovarian cancers conferred by being a carrier of BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline variant can negatively impact physical and psychological well-being. Novel nonpharmacological interventions on well-being in women with BRCA variants have rarely been reported. To determine the effect of a 12-week inquiry-based stress reduction (IBSR) program on psychological well-being, sleep quality, psychosocial variables, and attitudes toward risk-reducing surgical procedures among women in Israel who carried BRCA variants. This randomized clinical trial had a 12-week intervention period and a 12-week follow-up period. It was conducted between April 1, 2017, and July 31, 2020. Participants were recruited from the Meirav Breast Center at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel, and the intervention was conducted in Tel Aviv, Israel. The cohort included women with BRCA variants. Data were analyzed from August 1 to December 1, 2020. Women were randomly assigned to the 12-week IBSR program or standard care. The IBSR technique is based on the skills of mindfulness, inquiry, and cognitive reframing. The intervention included standardized, weekly group meetings conducted throughout 12 weeks. Standard care included semi-annual breast examinations and breast magnetic resonance imaging (alternating), a gynecological examination, a transvaginal ultrasonographic examination, and CA-125 serum determination. Differences between the groups were tested using mixed-effects models in an intent to treat analysis. The primary outcome was psychological well-being, including 6 parameters: autonomy, personal growth, positive relationships, control of the environment, goals in life, and self-acceptance. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality, attitudes toward risk-reducing surgical procedures, and psychosocial variables. Questionnaires were administered at baseline (T1), at completion of the 12-week intervention (T2), and 12 weeks after completion of the intervention (T3). Overall, 100 women (mean [SD] age, 41.37 [11.06] years) completed the study, with 50 randomized to the intervention group and 50 randomized to the control group. Mean (SD) time from variant discovery was 4.7 (3.3) years. There were no differences between the intervention and control groups in baseline mean (SD) scores of psychological well-being parameters (autonomy: 55.20 [11.12] vs 56.77 [9.90]; environmental control: 56.30 [11.98 vs 58.51 [11.41]; positive relationships: 63.10 [15.91] vs 68.10 [9.86]; goals in life: 60.00 [14.12] vs 64.82 [10.57]; self-acceptance: 55.02 [16.62] vs 60.32 [13.50]) except personal growth (63.70 [14.66] vs 68.85 [8.07]). The IBSR group, compared with the control group, experienced better mean (SD) scores on all psychological well-being parameters at T2 (autonomy: 63.64 [8.35] vs 54.73 [10.41]; environmental control: 63.95 [10.05] vs 57.45 [11.43]; personal growth: 73.00 [8.34] vs 65.76 [10.95]; positive relationships 71.17 [9.99] vs 65.06 [12.58]; goals in life: 67.57 [8.88] vs 61.18 [12.87]; self-acceptance: 66.93 [11.15] vs 58.09 [15.55]) and at T3 (autonomy: 62.68 [9.05] vs 56.12 [10.64]; environmental control: 64.55 [10.28] vs 59.35 [12.98]; personal growth: 72.00 [8.06] vs 67.15 [11.82]; positive relationships: 71.24 [9.78] vs 66.92 [12.37]; goals in life: 68.33 [8.54] vs 62.92 [13.24]; self-acceptance: 66.84 [11.35] vs 58.97 [17.03]). Individuals in the IBSR group also experienced statistically significant improvements in sleep quality (mean [SD]: T1, 7.35 [3.97]; T3, 4.63 [3.21], P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), whereas the control group experienced no statistically significant difference. Women in the intervention group had a more favorable consideration of risk-reducing oophorectomy, from 7 women (14%) who refused to consider oophorectomy at T1 to 1 woman (2%) who refused to consider it at T3 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04), and similar change in consideration of mastectomy: from 23 women (46%) who refused to consider mastectomy at T1 to 13 women (29%) who refused to consider it at T3 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). This randomized clinical trial found that IBSR improved psychological well-being and led to a more favorable view on risk-reducing surgical procedures for at least 6 months among women in Israel who carried BRCA variants. These results suggest that IBSR may be implemented as a self-practice tool to enhance the well-being of individuals who carry BRCA variants and support them in their decision-making processes.
