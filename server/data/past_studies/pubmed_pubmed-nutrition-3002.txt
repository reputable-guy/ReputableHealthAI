Study Title: Enhancing the Impact of Individualized Nutrition Therapy with Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring Feedback in Overweight and Obese Individuals with Prediabetes.

Study Summary:
prediabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and other complications. Early diagnosis of prediabetes, coupled with education on lifestyle changes that support blood glucose management, are crucial for the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes and related complications. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of incorporating real-time feedback from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) into individualized nutrition therapy (INT) on blood glucose control in individuals with prediabetes who are overweight or obese. participants (mean age &#xb1; SD: 55 &#xb1; 6 years; BMI: 31.1 &#xb1; 4.1 kg/m&#xb2;) were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (= 15) or the control group (= 15). Both groups received INT and CGM, but the control group was blinded to the CGM data until the end of this study. Participants were followed for 30 days and visited the lab every 10 days for CGM replacement, study measurements, and dietary consultations. the treatment group showed a significant increase in the percentage of time spent in the target blood glucose range (= 0.02) and a significant decrease in the mean blood glucose concentration (< 0.05), glucose management indicator (= 0.02), percent coefficient of variation for blood glucose (= 0.01), and percent time spent in the high or very high blood glucose ranges (= 0.04). These changes were not statistically significant for the control group. adding CGM feedback to INT resulted in better management of blood glucose levels in overweight or obese individuals with prediabetes.
