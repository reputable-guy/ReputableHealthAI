Study Title: Analysis of implementation processes in a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for major depressive disorder in prisons: Training, supervision, and recommendations.

Study Summary:
There are 10 million admissions to U.S. prisons and jails each year. More than half of those admitted have mental health problems. The goal of this article is to inform: (1) implementation of evidence-based mental health treatments in prisons and jails, an important effort that needs more evidence to guide it; (2) psychotherapy and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) training efforts, especially in low-resource settings. A randomized hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of group IPT for major depressive disorder (MDD) in state prisons found that IPT increased rates of MDD remission and lowered posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms relative to prison treatment as usual. The trial used prison counselors, only some of whom had prior psychotherapy training/experience, to deliver IPT. IPT treatment adherence was high (96%), but trial training and supervision were too costly to be scalable outside the trial. The current article reports results from a planned qualitative analysis of 460 structured implementation and supervision documents in that trial to describe training and supervision processes and lessons learned, inform training recommendations, and facilitate future work to optimize training and supervision for under-resourced settings. Themes identified in implementation and supervision process notes reflected: work on psychotherapy basics (reflective listening, focusing on emotions, open-ended questions, specific experiences), IPT case conceptualization (forming a conceptualization, what is and is not therapeutic work, structure and limit setting, structure vs. flexibility), IPT techniques (enhancing social support, role plays, communication analysis), psychotherapy processes (alliance repair, managing group processes), and managing difficult situations (avoidance, specific clients, challenging work settings). Counselors were receptive to feedback; some relied on study supervisors for support in managing stressful prison working conditions. Findings can be used to make future training and supervision more efficient. Based on our results, we recommend that initial and refresher training focus on IPT case conceptualization, steps for addressing each IPT problem area, and reflective listening. We also recommend supervision through at least counselors' first two rounds of groups. More low-cost, scalable training methods are needed to get mental health treatment to individuals who need it most, who are often served in challenging, low-resource settings such as prisons. This is a mental health access and equity issue. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01685294).
