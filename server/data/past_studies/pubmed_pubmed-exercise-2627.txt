Study Title: Impact of Physical Activity in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Catheter Ablation: The Multicenter Randomized BE-ACTION Trial.

Study Summary:
Arrhythmia recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is common. We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to determine the impact of increased physical activity on atrial fibrillation recurrence after PVI. From 2018 to 2020, we randomly assigned 200 patients with atrial fibrillation to the ACTION or NO-ACTION group in 4 different centers in the local country of Brandenburg, Germany. Patients were eligible if they were scheduled to undergo PVI, aged &#x2265;50 to &#x2264;77 years, body mass index &#x2265;23 to &#x2264;35 kg/m, and accepted wearing an activity tracker allowing 24-hour activity monitoring via mobile app. Patients in the ACTION group were actively remote-controlled via transmitted activity data by a physiotherapist, and individual motivational interviewing call sessions were scheduled with each ACTION patient every 2 weeks. The primary end point was the composite of recurrence of any atrial arrhythmia >30 seconds, additional ablation procedure, cardioversion, and new onset of antiarrhythmic drugs earliest after 90 days after index PVI over 12 months. Overall, the median age of patients was 66 (interquartile range, 61-71) years, 33.5% were women, and 52% had persistent atrial fibrillation. The number of steps per day increased in both groups of patients from baseline to 12 months (<0.001). The absolute increase in steps per day did not differ between patients in the ACTION group with +3205 steps (597-4944) compared with those in the NO-ACTION group +2423 steps (17-4284),=0.325. Unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in the primary composite end point in the ACTION group (27.3%) versus the NO-ACTION group (32.7%),=0.405. Physical activity improved in patients after PVI. The present randomized controlled trial shows that activity tracker and motivational calls to increase physical activity versus activity tracker alone did not reduce the occurrence of the primary composite end point of atrial fibrillation recurrence or the absolute increase in steps per day.
