Study Title: Effects of using a mobile application on pelvic floor training in women with stress urinary incontinence: A randomized controlled clinical study.

Study Summary:
Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as any involuntary loss of urine that causes negative impacts on women's lives. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is considered to be "level A" of scientific evidence in the treatment of UI. Despite its efficacy, it is known that the effect of PFMT may depend on continuous adherence. Therefore, healthcare professionals are looking for alternatives to improve adherence in their patients. Healthcare has been innovating through mobile device apps. Thus, the objective of this study was to verify the effects of PFMT with the use of a mobile device app in incontinent women. This was a controlled, randomized clinical trial that occurred remotely. A total of 104 women with stress UI and/or mixed incontinence, over 18 years old, literate, with preserved cognitive capacity, with internet access and a mobile device with the Android system, participated in this study. They were randomly divided into two groups: The App group and the Booklet group, which underwent a PFMT protocol guided by a mobile app and a booklet, respectively. Both groups received daily reminders to perform the exercises. Before and after 12 weeks of intervention, it was evaluated using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ). Both groups showed improvements in the final ICIQ-SF score. However, superior results were shown for the Booklet group (App: pre: 11.5 [&#xb1;3.8], post: 9.8 [&#xb1;4.5]; Booklet: pre: 12.6 [&#xb1;4.5], post: 7.4 [&#xb1;4.3]; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). It was concluded that PFMT, with the use of a mobile app, is capable of reducing UI and the impact of UI, but it is not superior to training with the use of booklet instructions.
