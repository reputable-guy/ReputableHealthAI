Study Title: Clinical study of enhanced recovery after surgery in laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis.

Study Summary:
Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol is a comprehensive management modality that promotes patient recovery, especially in the patients undergoing digestive tumor surgeries. However, it is less commonly used in the appendectomy. To study the application value of ERAS in laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis. A total of 120 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy due to acute appendicitis were divided into experimental group and control group by random number table method, including 63 patients in the experimental group and 57 patients in the control group. Patients in the experimental group were managed with the ERAS protocol, and those in the control group were received the traditional treatment. The exhaust time, the hospitalization duration, the hospitalization expense and the pain score between the two groups were compared. There was no significant difference in age, gender, body mass index and Sunshine Appendicitis Grading System score between the experimental group and the control group (> 0.05). Compared to the control group, the patients in the experimental group had earlier exhaust time, shorter hospitalization time, less hospitalization cost and lower degree of pain sensation. The differences were statistically significant (< 0.01). ERAS could significantly accelerate the recovery of patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis, shorten the hospitalization time and reduce hospitalization costs. It is a safe and effective approach.
