Study Title: Effects of Pilates method on quality of life, fatigue and sleep quality among breast cancer women receiving hormone therapy - Two-arm randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To analyze the effect of the Pilates method on the quality of life, fatigue, and sleep quality of patients undergoing adjuvant clinical treatment with hormone therapy for breast cancer. A randomized two-arm clinical trial with 34 breast cancer women that were randomized into two groups: a) Intervention group, who performed 16 weeks of mat Pilates; b) Control group, who maintained their daily routine activities and received three educational sessions. The questionnaires for each variable were applied before the intervention, after the intervention, and six months after the end of the intervention. Quality of life was assessed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), fatigue by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), and sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The fatigue variable presented a time effect (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034) regardless of the analyzed group, in which a difference was found between baseline and the post-intervention period (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.037). The variable sleep showed an effect of time (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025), presenting a difference between the baseline period and six months, with improvement for all participants (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004). Global health also showed a positive change also for all participants, with an isolated effect of time (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024). Interventions based on the Pilates method may bring positive results in quality of life, fatigue, and sleep quality in patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, but further studies on the subject are needed to prove the results in a larger number of patients.
