Study Title: Effect of a physical exercise program supported by wearable technology in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
to investigate the effects of a physical exercise (PE) program, supported by wearable technology (WT), in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). 29 children with DRE were randomized to experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups. To encourage PE, the EG performed one hour of aerobic activity three days a week for six months, outside the school setting. Compliance was monitored using activity wristbands, with data reported weekly by parents. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), seizure frequency, physical activity (PA), physical fitness (musculoskeletal, motor, and Cardiorespiratory Fitness), and body composition, were assessed at baseline, at three and six months. Seizure frequency in the last six months evolved from 10.5 seizures/week at baseline, to 4.5 at the end of the study in the EG, and from 5.2 seizures/week to one in the CG. Significant differences were found in weekly hours-PE (&#x3b7;2= 0.49); motor fitness (&#x3b7;2= 0.08); Cardiorespiratory Fitness (&#x3b7;2= 0.19); weight (&#x3b7;2= 0.003); Triceps skinfold thickness (&#x3b7;2= 0.05); lower limb muscular strength (&#x3b7;2= 0.03); HRQoL (&#x3b7;2= 0.02); and PA (&#x3b7;2= 0.22). Post-hoc ANOVA revealed that EG improved significantly (p < 0.05) between baseline and six months. Negative correlations were observed between PA and seizure frequency. Supported by WT, children with DRE increased the weekly hours of PE at three and six months, with no increase in seizure frequency. Our study provides evidence of the effectiveness of PE for improving HRQoL.
