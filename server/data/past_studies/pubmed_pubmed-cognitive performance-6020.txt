Study Title: Brain endurance training improves soccer-specific technical skills and cognitive performance in fatigued professional soccer players.

Study Summary:
Brain Endurance Training (BET) - the addition of mentally fatiguing cognitive tasks to standard physical training - could improve performance in soccer. We tested whether BET, with cognitive tasks intermixed with physical training activities, improved players' cognitive and soccer-specific technical performance compared to physical training alone when fresh and fatigued. The study employed a pre/training/midtest/training/posttest design. 31 professional male soccer players were randomly assigned to BET or control groups and completed 18 physical training sessions over 6&#x202f;weeks. In between the physical training activities, the BET group completed demanding cognitive tasks, whereas the control group rested. Players completed the Loughborough soccer passing (LSPT) and shooting test (LSST) before and after completing a 30-min Stroop task. A brief psychomotor vigilance test (PVT-B), a visual analog rating of mental fatigue (MF-VAS), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during testing and training. During testing, the 30-min Stroop task elicited a state of MF, confirmed by higher subjective ratings (P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.01). Compared to pre-testing, at mid- and post-testing, the BET group improved passing (all P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.01), shooting (all P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.01), and PVT-B performance (all P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.01) when tested after (fatigued) but not before (fresh) the Stroop task, whereas the control group did not change performance either way. During training the BET group reported higher MF (P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.01) and exhibited slower PVT-B responses (P&#x202f;<&#x202f;.01) compared to control. Intermixed BET was more effective than physical training alone at improving cognitive and soccer-specific technical performance of professional soccer players when fatigued.
