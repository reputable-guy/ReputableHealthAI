Study Title: Understanding Australian general practice patients' decisions to deprescribe antidepressants in the WiserAD trial: a realist informed approach.

Study Summary:
To evaluate how an approach to antidepressant deprescribing works, for whom, and in what contexts by (1) examining the experiences and perceptions of the approach for antidepressant users, (2) identifying the mechanisms of the approach and (3) describing what contexts are associated with antidepressant tapering. This mixed methods study was informed by the principles of realist evaluation and was conducted in the first 3&#x2009;months of participation in the WiserAD randomised control trial. General practice, Victoria, Australia. 13 antidepressant users from general practice participating in the WiserAD trial for antidepressant deprescribing. A patient-facing, web-based structured support tool that consists of a personalised tapering schedule, an action plan for managing withdrawal symptoms, a daily mood, sleep and activity tracker and mental health nurse support. The outcomes of the study were revealed on data analysis as per a realist evaluation approach which tests and refines an initial programme theory. The contexts of learnt coping skills, knowledge and perceptions of antidepressants and feeling well were evident. Outcomes were intention to commence, initiation of deprescribing and successful completion of deprescribing. Key mechanisms for antidepressant deprescribing were (1) initiation of the deprescribing discussion; (2) patient self-efficacy; (3) provision of structured guidance; (4) coaching; (5) mood, sleep and activity tracking and (6) feelings of safety during the tapering period. The WiserAD approach to antidepressant deprescribing supported participants to commence and/or complete tapering. The refined programme theory presents the WiserAD pragmatic framework for the application of antidepressant deprescribing in clinical practice.
