Study Title: Design of the Equity in Prevention and Progression of Hypertension by Addressing Barriers to Nutrition and Physical Activity Study: A Cluster Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
High rates of hypertension and poverty in the rural south contribute to health disparities with Black adults experiencing higher rates of cardiovascular disease than White adults, underscoring the need to identify prevention strategies. The equity in prevention and progression of hypertension by addressing barriers to nutrition and physical activity (EPIPHANY) study is a cluster randomized controlled trial testing a multilevel intervention to reduce barriers to a healthy lifestyle to lower blood pressure (BP) among rural, Black adults. Health education fairs offered to 20 churches in the Alabama Black Belt are being used to screen and enroll adults with elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP 120-139 mmHg and diastolic BP < 90 mmHg) who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication, according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association BP guideline. Participants (n = 240) in churches randomized to the control condition are offered access to online resources including cooking and exercise classes. Participants (n = 240) in churches randomized to the intervention are receiving access to online resources; telephone-based peer support for lifestyle modification; funding for churches to develop programs to address food access and/or barriers to physical activity; and training of church members to serve as church champions to deliver training for church members on lifestyle modification. We will employ a Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to assess effectiveness and implementation. The EPIPHANY study is designed to prevent hypertension among rural, Black adults by addressing structural and individual barriers to lifestyle modification through peer support.
