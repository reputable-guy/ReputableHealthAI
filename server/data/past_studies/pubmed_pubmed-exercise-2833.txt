Study Title: Effects of Balance and Strength Training for Ankle Proprioception in People with Chronic Ankle Instability: A Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
After an ankle sprain, the ligament and joint capsule are damaged, and as a result, proprioceptive sense is damaged, causing a feeling of giving away in the ankle and resulting in recurrent sprains. Given the relevant studies, it has been seen that people with chronic ankle instability (CAI) commonly have deficits in joint position sense and reinjury risks. Joint position sense plays an important role in ankle control, thereby reducing the risk of injury. Therefore, this study aims to compare the effects of balance and strength training on ankle proprioception in people with CAI. This single-blind randomized controlled study included 29 volunteer participants (21 women and eight men) aged 18 to 30 years. Participants with a Cumberland ankle instability scale score less than or equal to 24 were randomly divided into two treatment groups: strength training (n = 14) and balance training (n = 15). Y balance test, joint position, and vibration sense were evaluated at the beginning and end of the treatment. "Hop to stabilization" exercises were applied to the balance group and resistive bands exercises to the strength group, which were performed for 6 weeks, 35 minutes per day, two times per week. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial directions of the Y balance test (P = .89, P = .50, and P = .34, respectively), but the strength training group showed significant improvement in ankle proprioception (140&#xb0;) and vibration sense (fifth finger) (P < .001), and the post hoc Cohen's d effect size values were medium (.52) and small (.25), respectively. The findings of this study show that strengthening and balance exercises have similar effects on dynamic balance, but strengthening exercises are more effective in improving joint position and vibration sense. Given the positive effects of both exercise programs, it is recommended to implement the two interventions separately or together for CAI rehabilitation.
