Study Title: Effect of a texture-modified and controlled bolus volume diet on all-cause mortality in older persons with oropharyngeal dysphagia: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is common among older adults. Some studies have evaluated the efficacy of a texture-modified diet on mortality but with short-term follow-up. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a texture-modified diet and controlled bolus volume on all-cause mortality after 12 months in older persons with OD. This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial included patients aged &#x2265;60&#x2009;years with a diagnosis of OD. They were concurrently and randomly assigned to receive either a texture-modified food diet and controlled bolus volume (intervention group) or standard treatment (control group) with 12 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were oral intake, weight, handgrip strength, phase angle, and aspiration pneumonia. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model were used for mortality analysis. A total of 127 participants (intervention group: 64 and control group: 63) were recruited, with a mean age of 76 years. The probability of all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8, 12%) than in the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18, 29%) (hazard ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.16-0.86]; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). There were 5 (7.9%) and 10 (16.1%) aspiration pneumonia events in the intervention and control groups, respectively (not significant) in 12 months of follow-up. Changes were observed in protein consumption (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), body weight (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), body mass index (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), handgrip strength (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), and phase angle (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) between the treatment groups. Compared with the standard treatment, the dietary intervention improved efficacy by limiting nutrition complications, aspiration pneumonia, and all-cause mortality.
