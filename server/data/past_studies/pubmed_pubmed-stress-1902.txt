Study Title: Telehealth-delivered parent-based sleep-focused intervention for insomnia in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Sleep problems are common in children with autism spectrum disorder. Although the effects of parent-based sleep intervention were shown to be promising, previous research was limited to the face-to-face service model, which might limit accessibility. This study examined a sleep-focused parent training group delivered via telehealth for treating insomnia in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder, which allowed parents to join the intervention remotely. Results showed that children in the intervention group had greater improvements in sleep and insomnia symptoms after treatment, as compared to those who only received care as usual. This sleep-focused treatment also led to improved daytime behaviors, especially externalizing problems such as hyperactivity and conduct problems, in children with autism spectrum disorder. Parents who had attended the training also reported reduced parental stress level after treatment. The findings supported the feasibility and promising effects of a brief parent-based sleep intervention delivered via telehealth for preschooler with autism spectrum disorder.
