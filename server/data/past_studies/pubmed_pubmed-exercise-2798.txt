Study Title: Nettle-induced Urticaria Treatment Study (NUTS): demonstrating the joy of research through a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The use of dock leaves to ease the discomfort of nettle stings is a well-known folk remedy in the British Isles, yet has never been tested in a clinical trial. A group of Emergency Department doctors designed and conducted the Nettle-induced Urticaria Treatment Study (NUTS) as a research training and team-building exercise to address this gap in the Emergency Medicine evidence base.
