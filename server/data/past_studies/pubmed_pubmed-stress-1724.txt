Study Title: Maternal recorded voice played to preterm infants in incubators reduces her own depression, anxiety and stress: a pilot randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
To study the effects of playing mother's recorded voice to preterm infants in the NICU on their mothers' mental health as measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale -21 (DASS-21) questionnaire. This was a pilot single center prospective randomized controlled trial done at a level IV NICU. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04559620). Inclusion criteria were mothers of preterm infants with gestational ages between 26wks and 30&#x2009;weeks. DASS-21 questionnaire was administered to all the enrolled mothers in the first week after birth followed by recording of their voice by the music therapists. In the interventional group, recorded maternal voice was played into the infant incubator between 15 and 21&#x2009;days of life. A second DASS-21 was administered between 21 and 23&#x2009;days of life. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare DASS-21 scores between the two groups and Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the pre- and post-intervention DASS-21 scores. Forty eligible mothers were randomized: 20 to the intervention group and 20 to the control group. The baseline maternal and neonatal characteristics were similar between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the DASS-21 scores between the two groups at baseline or after the study intervention. There was no difference in the pre- and post-interventional DASS-21 scores or its individual components in the experimental group. There was a significant decrease in the total DASS-21 score and the anxiety component of DASS-21 between weeks 1 and 4 in the control group. In this pilot randomized control study, recorded maternal voice played into preterm infant's incubator did not have any effect on maternal mental health as measured by the DASS-21 questionnaire. Data obtained in this pilot study are useful in future RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trial) to address this important issue.
