Study Title: Effect of the Emory Healthy Kitchen Collaborative on Employee Health Habits and Body Weight: A 12-Month Workplace Wellness Trial.

Study Summary:
Teaching kitchens are being used to facilitate lifestyle changes with a focus on culinary and nutrition programs to improve health behaviors. Less is known regarding their use as a worksite wellness program and their influence on employees' quality of life, body weight, and adoption of healthy behaviors. We evaluated changes in self-reported healthy behaviors, overall health, and weight during a one-year multidisciplinary teaching kitchen program. Thirty-eight benefits-eligible employees were recruited, screened based on a priori eligibility criteria that prioritized elevated body mass index (BMI), co-morbid conditions, and high levels of motivation to make lifestyle changes, and consented to participate in The Emory Healthy Kitchen Collaborative. This 12-month program included a 10-week didactic and experiential curriculum followed by continued support and access to health coaching implemented in an academic health system university hospital workplace between 2019 and 2020. Comparative statistics, paired-test, Mcnemar's tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess changes at four time points. Participants improved diet quality (&#x2264; 0.0001), increased confidence in tasting new foods (= 0.03), and increased mindful eating habits (= 0.00002). Significant changes were seen in physical activity levels; aerobic activities (= 0.007), strength resistance activities (= 0.02), and participation in yoga (= 0.002). Most participants weighed within 5 lbs. of their starting weight at 3 months (= 0.57). A teaching kitchen intervention is an innovative model for improving employee health behaviors and general health self-perception.
