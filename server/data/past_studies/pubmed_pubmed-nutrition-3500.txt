Study Title: Comparison of Patient Satisfaction Between Face-to-Face and Telehealth Modalities in Nephrolithiasis Nutritional Counseling.

Study Summary:
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage increased. Virtual visits minimize exposure risk while also addressing barriers to care. Telehealth offers the ability to increase patient access and provider efficiency. However, patient satisfaction with telehealth has not been fully determined. This study evaluated patient-perceived quality and satisfaction of virtual vs face-to-face visits during consultation with a dietician in the management of nephrolithiasis. Ninety-six patients with previous diagnosis of nephrolithiasis underwent an initial, in-person nutrition consultation between May 2019 to February 2021. A follow-up with a dietician was randomized to in-person or telehealth. The telehealth group used an application called MDLive. The telehealth group used MDLive on a hospital computer during their follow-up with the urologist, whereas the in-person group had a separate appointment scheduled at a different location. Patient satisfaction following telehealth visits was assessed by the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. Patient satisfaction following in-person visits was assessed with an 8-question modified Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire, which lacked technology-related questions. Fifty patients were randomized to in-person follow-up and 46 to virtual follow-up. Within the virtual follow-up group more than 90% "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that they were satisfied with the quality of service provided through telemedicine. Greater than 82% reported intention to use telemedicine services again. There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and face-to-face visits. Sixty-seven percent of patients in the telemedicine group reported better access to health care services and time saved and 89% reported independence accessing the telehealth system without assistance. This study supports the idea that telemedicine may be a successful alternative in the follow up of patients undergoing nutritional counseling for stone prevention. Future studies regarding telehealth use should evaluate which other urologic conditions are amenable to virtual management.
