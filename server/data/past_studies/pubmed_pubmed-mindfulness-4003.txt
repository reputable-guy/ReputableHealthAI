Study Title: Experience of Telephone-Based Diabetes Health Coaching Among Community-Based Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.

Study Summary:
In the past decade, diabetes health coaching, also referred to as diabetes coaching, has emerged as a patient-centered intervention to help individuals with type 2 diabetes gain independence with self-management. This study explores the perceived experience of receiving telephone-based diabetes health coaching among adults living with type 2 diabetes. A qualitative exploration with an interpretive descriptive design was carried out. Participants from the intervention group of a larger randomized controlled trial who had received a telephone-based diabetes coaching intervention throughout 1 year were invited to participate in a telephone interview with open-ended questions. Twelve participants were interviewed, and four major themes emerged:) adapting to ongoing challenges with type 2 diabetes, reflecting how coaching helped individuals integrate diabetes into their daily lives by addressing misconceptions, improving knowledge, encouraging awareness, and easing the transition from oral medication to insulin injections;) heightened mindfulness of diabetes-related wellness, capturing the greater attention participants gave to their overall well-being and self-management behaviors;) behavior change guided by the participant, highlighting the differences in participants' motivation, readiness to make changes, and external factors that influenced their ability to make self-management behavior changes; and) valuing a supportive relationship, illustrating that most participants felt that the unique coach-client relationship was reliable, holistic, nonjudgmental, and encouraging. Participants found diabetes coaching to be positive and highlighted the various ways it was able to support their ability to manage diabetes.
