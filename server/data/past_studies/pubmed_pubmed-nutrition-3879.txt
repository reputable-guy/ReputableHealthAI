Study Title: Effects of a School-Based Gardening, Cooking, and Nutrition Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial on Unprocessed and Ultra-Processed Food Consumption.

Study Summary:
School-based gardening and nutrition education interventions report improvements in dietary intake, notably through fruit and vegetables. However, gardening, cooking, and nutrition randomized controlled trials are limited in evaluating dietary quality, and none have examined processed food consumption to date. The study examined the effects of Texas Sprouts (TX Sprouts), a gardening, cooking, and nutrition education intervention, compared with control on unprocessed and ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption in predominately low-income Hispanic children. TX Sprouts was a school-based cluster randomized controlled trial that consisted of 16 elementary schools randomly assigned to either the TX Sprouts intervention (n = 8 schools) or control (delayed intervention; n = 8 schools) over 3 y (2016-2019). TX Sprouts schools received an outdoor teaching garden and 18 1-h lessons taught by trained educators throughout the school year. Dietary intake data via 2 24-h dietary recalls were collected on a random subsample (n = 468) at baseline and postintervention. All foods and beverages were categorized using the NOVA food classification system (e.g., unprocessed, processed, ultra-processed). Generalized linear mixed effects modeling tested changes in percent calories and grams of NOVA groups between the intervention and control estimates with schools as random clusters. Of the sample, 63% participated in the free and reduced-price lunch program, and 57% were Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic White (21%) and non-Hispanic Black (12%). The intervention, compared to the control, resulted in an increase in consumption of unprocessed foods (2.3% compared with -1.8% g; P < 0.01) and a decrease in UPF (-2.4% compared with 1.4% g; P = 0.04). In addition, Hispanic children in the intervention group had an increase in unprocessed food consumption and a decrease in UPF consumption compared to non-Hispanic children (-3.4% compared with 1.5% g; P < 0.05). Study results suggest that school-based gardening, cooking, and nutrition education interventions can improve dietary intake, specifically increasing unprocessed food consumption and decreasing UPF consumption. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02668744.
