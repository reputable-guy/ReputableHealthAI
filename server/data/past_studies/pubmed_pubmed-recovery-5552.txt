Study Title: Hemodynamic Effects of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression on Athletes: A Double-Blinded Randomized Crossover Study.

Study Summary:
There are multiple postexercise recovery technologies available in the market based on the assumption of blood-flow enhancement. Lower-limb intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) has been widely used, but the available scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness remains scarce, requiring a deeper investigation into its underlying mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the hemodynamic effects caused by the use of IPC at rest. Twenty-two soccer and track and field athletes underwent two 15-minute IPC protocols (moderate- [80&#xa0;mm Hg] and high-pressure [200&#xa0;mm Hg]) in a randomized order. Systolic peak velocity, end-diastolic peak velocity, arterial diameter, and heart rate were measured before, during (at the eighth minute), and 2&#xa0;minutes after each IPC protocol. Significant effects were observed between before and during (eighth minute) the IPC protocol for measures of systolic (P < .001) and end-diastolic peak velocities (P < .001), with the greater effects observed during the high-pressure protocol. Moreover, 2&#xa0;minutes after each IPC protocol, hemodynamic variables returned to values close to baseline. Arterial diameter presented significant differences between pressures during the IPC protocols (P < .05), while heart rate remained unaltered. IPC effectively enhances transitory blood flow of athletes, particularly when applying high-pressure protocols.
