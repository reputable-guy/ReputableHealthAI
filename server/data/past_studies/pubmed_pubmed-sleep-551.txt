Study Title: A randomized controlled trial of alpha phase-locked auditory stimulation to treat symptoms of sleep onset insomnia.

Study Summary:
Sleep onset insomnia is a pervasive problem that contributes significantly to the poor health outcomes associated with insufficient sleep. Auditory stimuli phase-locked to slow-wave sleep oscillations have been shown to augment deep sleep, but it is unknown whether a similar approach can be used to accelerate sleep onset. The present randomized controlled crossover trial enrolled adults with objectively verified sleep onset latencies (SOLs) greater than 30&#xa0;min to test the effect of auditory stimuli delivered at specific phases of participants' alpha oscillations prior to sleep onset. During the intervention week, participants wore an electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled headband that delivered acoustic pulses timed to arrive anti-phase with alpha for 30&#xa0;min (Stimulation). During the Sham week, the headband silently recorded EEG. The primary outcome was SOL determined by blinded scoring of EEG records. For the 21 subjects included in the analyses, stimulation had a significant effect on SOL according to a linear mixed effects model (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0019), and weekly average SOL decreased by 10.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15.9&#xa0;min (29.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;44.4%). These data suggest that phase-locked acoustic stimulation can be a viable alternative to pharmaceuticals to accelerate sleep onset in individuals with prolonged sleep onset latencies. Trial Registration: This trial was first registered on clinicaltrials.gov on 24/02/2023 under the name Sounds Locked to ElectroEncephalogram Phase For the Acceleration of Sleep Onset Time (SLEEPFAST), and assigned registry number NCT05743114.
