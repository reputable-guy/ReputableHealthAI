Study Title: How Maternal Nutritional and Mental Health Affects Child Health During Pregnancy: A Narrative Review.

Study Summary:
Throughout pregnancy, the mother's nutritional and mental health significantly influences the kid's long-term growth and wellness. This review's objective is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature on the link between pregnancy nutrition and a sound mind and a foetus' growth, considering factors in the physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains. A balanced, nutrient-rich diet is crucial for the baby to grow and develop properly during pregnancy. An appropriate diet of significant macronutrients and micronutrients supports good foetal organ development, cognitive function, and immune system resiliency. For instance, studies have linked iron and omega-3 fatty acids to a reduced risk of developmental delays and improved cognitive performance. Contrarily, malnutrition in mothers, such as undernutrition or excessive weight gain, has been connected with negative results, including low birth weight, poor neurodevelopment, and increased susceptibility to chronic diseases in later life. The mother's mental health, including emotional equilibrium and psychological stability, significantly impacts the child's development. Stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by mothers during pregnancy harm the developing foetus and increase the risk of cognitive, behavioural, and emotional difficulties in the offspring. The growing foetus is exposed to high levels of stress hormones due to chronic maternal stress, which might alter the fetus's brain's shape and function. Factors influencing child development outcomes include maternal-infant attachment, breastfeeding start and duration, and general caring practices. A comprehensive approach is critical since new research indicates a synergistic relationship between maternal nutrition and mental health. Inadequate nutritional intake might result from maternal mental health problems that interfere with appetite control and eating habits.&#xa0;On the other hand, inadequate maternal nutrition may raise maternal stress and result in mental health problems. Therefore, integrative therapies focusing on both areas are essential to maximise child development results. In conclusion, maternal nutrition and mental health during pregnancy significantly impact a child's development in various domains. Understanding the complex relationships between maternal nutrition and mental health is necessary to develop effective therapies and promote the most remarkable results for children. Further research is needed to understand better the underlying mechanisms to develop evidence-based recommendations for optimal mother care throughout pregnancy. The need of this review is to know how maternal health, physical or mental affects the child's development and how we can further prevent it by taking precautions during pregnancy.
