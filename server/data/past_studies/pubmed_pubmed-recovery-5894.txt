Study Title: Effects of extracorporeal diaphragm pacing combined with inspiratory muscle training on respiratory function in people with stroke: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effect of external diaphragmatic pacing (EDP) combined with inspiratory muscle training on respiratory function in post-stroke patients. Patients with stroke were enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in China between 2021 and 2022. The patients were randomized into an EDP treatment group (control group) or an EDP treatment plus inspiratory muscle training group (experimental group). Each therapy was administered once a day for 6&#x2009;days per week. The peak inspiratory flow (PIF), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV/FVC% ratio, and diaphragm thickness and mobility were measured and compared between the two groups after 4&#x2009;weeks. After 4&#x2009;weeks of intervention, respiratory muscle function indicators including PIF (95% CI: 0.21-1.28,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008) and MIP (95% CI: 6.92-25.44,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) significantly improved in the experimental group. Diaphragmatic thickness also significantly increased in the experimental group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), while diaphragmatic excursion showed no significant difference between the two groups. Additionally, FVC (95% CI: 0.14-1.14,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and FEV(95% CI: 0.20-1.06,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) demonstrated a significant increase in the experimental group, whereas FEV/FVC% (95% CI: -0.84 to 9.36,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.099) exhibited no significant group difference. EDP combined with inspiratory muscle training in individuals with stroke provides greater benefits than EDP alone in terms of respiratory function recovery, except for the parameters of diaphragmatic excursion and FEV/FVC%.
