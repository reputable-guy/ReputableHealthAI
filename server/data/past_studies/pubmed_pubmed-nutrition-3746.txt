Study Title: Time-resolved molecular measurements reveal changes in astronauts during spaceflight.

Study Summary:
From the early days of spaceflight to current missions, astronauts continue to be exposed to multiple hazards that affect human health, including low gravity, high radiation, isolation during long-duration missions, a closed environment and distance from Earth. Their effects can lead to adverse physiological changes and necessitate countermeasure development and/or longitudinal monitoring. A time-resolved analysis of biological signals can detect and better characterize potential adverse events during spaceflight, ideally preventing them and maintaining astronauts' wellness. Here we provide a time-resolved assessment of the impact of spaceflight on multiple astronauts (n = 27) by studying multiple biochemical and immune measurements before, during, and after long-duration orbital spaceflight. We reveal space-associated changes of astronauts' physiology on both the individual level and across astronauts, including associations with bone resorption and kidney function, as well as immune-system dysregulation.
