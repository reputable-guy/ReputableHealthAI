Study Title: Effects of Computerized Cognitive Training and Tai Chi on Cognitive Performance in Older Adults With Traumatic Brain Injury.

Study Summary:
To compare the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT) and tai chi (TC) with usual care (UC) on cognitive functions and secondary outcomes in older adults with traumatic brain injury. Ninety-six patients aged 55 years and older who had a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury requiring hospital admission. Randomized controlled trial. The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), Mini-Mental State Examination, modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status, and Trail Making Tests A and B. Compared with UC, CCT increased scores on the MDRS's total, attention, and memory and those on the Mini-Mental State Examination and Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status over the 6-month intervention; TC increased scores on the MDRS's total and conceptualization and those on the Mini-Mental State Examination over the 6-month intervention, while it also increased scores on the MDRS's total and initiation/preservation and those on the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status and reduced the time to complete the Trail Making Test B over the 12-month study. Furthermore, compared with UC, CCT increased handgrip strength and TC reduced the time to complete 5 sit-to-stands over the 6-month intervention. Both CCT and TC may improve global cognition and different specific cognitive domains in older traumatic brain injury patients; the TC's effect may last for at least an additional 6 months.
