Study Title: A year-long case study of multicomponent interventions to promote physical activity in office workers: A randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to identify if workplace interventions, (i.e., mindfulness classes and monetary incentives for gym attendance), influenced workers' physical activity. Office-based participants were randomized into one of four intervention assignments: 1) CONTROL (no interventions) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40), 2) MINDFULNESS (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;33), 3) GYM INCENTIVE (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;41), or 4) BOTH mindfulness and gym incentive (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;31). Activity-tracker and self-reported metabolic expenditure and step counts were gathered between January 2020 and December 2020 whereas the eight-week long interventions were provided between January and March 2020, when the impact of COVID-19 pandemic started. While physical activity decreased during the follow-up months, percent changes of physical activity at 1-, 2-, and 9-month follow-ups compared to baseline show no significant differences between or across the four intervention assignments (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). These results suggest that the intervention assignments had no effect on physical activity from baseline. The lack of effectiveness of these interventions on participant physical activity could be attributed to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any effects of the interventions could not outweigh the effects of the pandemic.
