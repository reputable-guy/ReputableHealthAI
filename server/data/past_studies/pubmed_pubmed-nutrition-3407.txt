Study Title: Effects of oral oligopeptide preparation and exercise intervention in older people with sarcopenia: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Nutrition and exercise are important interventions for sarcopenia. There were few studies on oral oligopeptide nutrition preparations combined with exercise to intervene in the older people with sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of oligopeptide nutrition preparation combined with exercise intervention on the older people with sarcopenia in community. A total of 219 subjects aged 65 years or older with sarcopenia were randomly divided into 4 groups. The nutrition group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;58) was given individualized nutrition education and oral oligopeptide nutrition preparation. The exercise group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) received exercise intervention. The combined group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;52) received both oral nutrition preparation and exercise interventions. The control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;59) only received individualized nutrition education. The nutrition preparation can provide energy 185kcal and protein 24.2g per day. The exercise intervention including warm-up exercise, resistance exercise and aerobic exercise, the training time was 60min for 5 times every week. The intervention lasted for 16&#xa0;weeks. Hand grip strength, gait speed, body composition and hematology parameters were measured before and after intervention. A total of 159 subjects completed the study. Compared with baseline, the left grip strength and 6-m walking speed of the subjects in nutrition group increased significantly after the intervention, and the grip strength of both hands in exercise group and combined group increased significantly. The body weight of the subjects in nutrition group, exercise group and combined group increased significantly after intervention, but no increase in soft lean mass (SLM) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was observed in any of the four groups. The fat-free mass (FFM) of the legs of the control group, exercise group and nutrition group decreased after intervention, and only the FFM of the legs of the combined group maintained the level before the intervention. Both oral peptide nutrition and exercise interventions can improve the muscle strength or function of the older people with sarcopenia. However, there were no increases in muscle mass observed.
