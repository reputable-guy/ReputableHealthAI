Study Title: The effect of family integrated care on preparing parents with premature infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit for discharge.

Study Summary:
The study was designed as a randomized controlled experimental trial to determine the effect of the Family Integrated Care (FICare) model on the readiness of parents whose infants were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for discharge and home care of the infants. Parents in the intervention group received FICare, and parents in the control group received standard care. The total mean score of the mothers and fathers in the intervention group regarding readiness for discharge and home care was higher than that of the control group, and a significant difference was observed. A statistically significant difference was found in terms of discharge weight, the day of first enteral feeding, and first breast milk. The FICare model was observed to enhance the readiness of mothers and fathers for discharge and home care and positively affect the infant's weight gain, the status of breastfeeding and the continuation of nutrition.
