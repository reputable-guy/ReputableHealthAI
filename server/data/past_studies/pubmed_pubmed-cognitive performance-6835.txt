Study Title: Effects of milk-based phospholipids on cognitive performance and subjective responses to psychosocial stress: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in high-perfectionist men.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to examine the stress-buffering potential of phospholipid (PL) intake on cognitive performance and neuroendocrine and psychological responses under conditions of psychosocial stress in a high-stress vulnerable (perfectionist) sample. Fifty-four high-perfectionist men consumed a 6-wk daily intake of a bovine milk-derived PL (2.7&#x2009;g/d) or placebo drink in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design. Working memory, executive control function, and acute physiological/subjective responses to an acute psychosocial stressor were examined before and after the 6-wk PL or placebo intake. PL intake improved post-stress reaction time performance on an attention-switching task (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). No significant attenuation of the salivary cortisol stress response was shown. PL intake significantly increased mid-stress induction energetic arousal (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). A non-significant reduction in anticipatory subjective stress was reported after PL intake (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.06). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P<0.04 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01, respectively) were significantly augmented in the PL condition. Dietary intake of bovine milk PLs conferred cognitive performance benefit under conditions of psychosocial stress but failed to moderate cortisol response. Moderation of subjective response to stress exposure may have underpinned this performance protection.
