Study Title: Nitroglycerin versus milrinone for low central venous pressure in patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Conventional anesthesia used to reduce central venous pressure (CVP) during hepatectomy includes fluid restriction and vasodilator drugs, which can lead to a reduction in blood perfusion in vital organs and may counteract the benefits of low blood loss. In this study, we hypothesized that milrinone is feasible and effective in controlling low CVP (LCVP) during laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH). Compared with conventional anesthesia such as nitroglycerin, milrinone is beneficial in terms of intraoperative blood loss, surgical environment, hemodynamic stability, and patients' recovery. In total, 68 patients undergoing LH under LCVP were randomly divided into the milrinone group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34) and the nitroglycerin group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34). Milrinone was infused with a loading dose of 10&#xa0;&#xb5;g/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 0.2-0.5&#xa0;&#xb5;g/kg/min and nitroglycerin was administered at a rate of 0.2-0.5&#xa0;&#xb5;g/kg/min until the liver lesions were removed. The characteristics of patients, surgery, intraoperative vital signs, blood loss, the condition of the surgical field, the dosage of norepinephrine, perioperative laboratory data, and postoperative complications were compared between groups. Blood loss during LH was considered the primary outcome. Blood loss during hepatectomy and total blood loss were significantly lower in the milrinone group compared with those in the nitroglycerin group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Both the nitroglycerin group and milrinone group exerted similar CVP (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Nevertheless, the milrinone group had better surgical field grading during liver resection (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and also exhibited higher cardiac index and cardiac output during the surgery (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Significant differences were also found in terms of fluids administered during hepatectomy, urine volume during hepatectomy, total urine volume, and norepinephrine dosage used in the surgery between the two groups. The two groups showed a similar incidence of postoperative complications (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Our findings indicate that the intraoperative infusion of milrinone can help in maintaining an LCVP and hemodynamic stability during LH while reducing intraoperative blood loss and providing a better surgical field compared with nitroglycerin.
