Study Title: Effect of Intravenous Dexmedetomidine Before Extubation on Emergence Delirium after Nasal Surgeries.

Study Summary:
To investigate the role of single dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 mcg/kg) in reducing the incidence and severity of postoperative emergence delirium (EmD). A randomised controlled trial. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Anaesthesia, Security Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 1st December 2022 to 30th March 2023. Patients, aged between 18-65 years, with ASA 1-3 scheduled to undergo nasal surgeries under general anaesthesia, were inducted in the study. Exclusion criteria were patient refusal, later request for removal from the study, inability to give consent, known allergy to dexmedetomidine, body mass index (BMI) more than 35, history of obstructive sleep apnoea, history of psychiatric illness, pregnancy, and presence of liver and renal diseases. The primary outcome measure of the study was the incidence of emergence delirium in the postoperative period. The frequency of EmD after nasal surgery was 52.38% in the control group compared to 14.28% in the dexmedetomidine group (p = 0.01). Pain scores were not statistically different between the two groups. The duration of post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay was significantly lesser in dexmedetomidine group (p <0.001). The satisfaction score on the visual analogue scale (VAS) was also found to be higher in patients who received intravenous dexmedetomidine (p <0.001). The use of single dose dexmedetomidine before extubation in nasal surgeries reduces the EmD and improves patient satisfaction.
