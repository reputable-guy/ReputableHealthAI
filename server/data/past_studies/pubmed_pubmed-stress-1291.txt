Study Title: Implementation of ungrading in the pharmacy curriculum.

Study Summary:
Ungrading is an alternative assessment approach that focuses on feedback provided to students in place of grades. Giving feedback as opposed to grades has been shown to increase intrinsic learner motivation, promote deeper learning, and decrease stress and anxiety. Four pharmacy faculty implemented ungrading practices into required pharmacy courses, including two pharmacy practice lab courses and two didactic courses. Specific strategies such as formative feedback, peer assessment, self-reflection, and small and large group discussions were incorporated to achieve the learning objectives for each course. This work provides details about the assignments and assessments used in each course. Anonymous surveys were administered to faculty members and students at a Midwest School of Pharmacy. Faculty members expressed varying levels of satisfaction and stress related to grading assessments. They also shared their opinions on teaching courses without traditional grades. The student survey examined factors such as grade point average (GPA), study time, and enjoyment of the pharmacy program. It also captured general opinions about grades. Based on survey results the implementation of ungrading practices helped students feel more prepared for advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). The findings contribute to the understanding of alternative grading approaches and their potential impact on student learning, well-being, and motivation. Rethinking assessment of student work may be a valid option for pharmacy schools, particularly in the setting of increased focus on student wellness and the educator's goal of increasing learning for all students.
