Study Title: Effect of easy cupping combined with pelvic floor electrical stimulation and Kegel exercise and pelvic floor muscle surface electromyography on symptoms improvement in women with stress urinary incontinence.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of easy cupping combined with pelvic floor electrical stimulation and Kegel exercises in treating female patients with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Ninety SUI patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group (pelvic floor electrical stimulation + Kegel exercises) and the experimental group (easy cupping + pelvic floor electrical stimulation + Kegel exercises). Outcomes assessed included pelvic floor muscle strength, urinary incontinence, urinary leakage, pelvic floor muscle surface electromyography, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction before and after treatment. Results showed significant improvements in pelvic floor muscle strength, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICI-Q-SF) scores, and urinary leakage in both groups, with the experimental group showing greater improvements (P < 0.05). The experimental group also had higher pelvic floor muscle potential values and a greater total effective rate (P < 0.05). No significant differences in adverse effects were noted between groups, and patient satisfaction was higher in the experimental group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the combination of easy cupping with pelvic floor electrical stimulation and Kegel exercises effectively enhances pelvic floor muscle strength, reduces urinary leakage, and improves patient satisfaction in women with stress urinary incontinence.
