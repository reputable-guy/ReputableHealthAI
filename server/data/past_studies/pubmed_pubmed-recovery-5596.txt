Study Title: Dexmedetomidine attenuates inflammatory response and chronic pain following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer.

Study Summary:
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine administration during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer on perioperative inflammatory response and chronic post-surgical pain. A cohort of 152 patients with lung cancer scheduled for elective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery participated in this randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups and administered an equivalent volume of dexmedetomidine (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;63) or normal saline (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;63). Dexmedetomidine was administered at a dose of 0.6&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/kg 10&#xa0;minutes before anesthesia induction and maintained at 0.5&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/kg/h until 0.5&#xa0;hours before surgery completed. Anesthesia and postoperative pain management protocols were standardized for both groups. The analysis included vital signs, numerical rating scales of pain, blood inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, pain type and location, patient-controlled intravenous analgesia usage, consumption of general anesthetics and pain rescue medications, as well as complications. The administration of dexmedetomidine resulted in decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, alongside tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and oxidative stress biomarkers (reactive oxygen species alongside malondialdehyde) but elevated levels of interleukin-10 and superoxide dismutase. In addition, the dexmedetomidine group showed lower postoperative numerical rating scale scores, reduced consumption of anesthetics, faster chest-tube removal, fewer patient-controlled intravenous analgesia presses, and shorter postoperative hospital stays. The administration of dexmedetomidine effectively attenuated surgical inflammation, oxidative stress, and postoperative pain, thereby promoting patient recovery after lung cancer surgery without increasing the risk of adverse effects or complications.
