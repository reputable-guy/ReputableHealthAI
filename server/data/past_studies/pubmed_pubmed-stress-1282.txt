Study Title: Sex- and dose-dependent catalase increase and its clinical impact in a benzoate dose-finding, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for Alzheimer's disease.

Study Summary:
Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are gaining increasing attention. Previously research has shown that sodium benzoate treatment can improve cognitive function in AD patients, particularly in the female patients; and 1000&#xa0;mg/day of benzoate appears more efficacious than lower doses. Catalase is a crucial endogenous antioxidant; and deficiency of catalase is regarded to be related to the pathogenesis of AD. The current study aimed to explore the role of sex and benzoate dose in the change of catalase activity among benzoate-treated AD patients. This secondary analysis used data from a double-blind trial, in which 149&#xa0;CE patients were randomized to receive placebo or one of three benzoate doses (500, 750, or 1000&#xa0;mg/day) and measured with Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale. Plasma catalase was assayed before and after treatment. Benzoate treatment, particularly at 1000&#xa0;mg/day, increased catalase among female patients, but not among male. The increases in the catalase activity among the benzoate-treated women were correlated with their cognitive improvements. In addition, higher baseline catalase activity was associated with more cognitive improvement after benzoate treatment among both female and male patients. Supporting the oxidative stress theory and sex difference in AD, the finding suggest that sex (female) and benzoate dose co-determine catalase increase in benzoate-treated AD patients and the catalase increment contributes to cognitive improvement of benzoate-treated women.
