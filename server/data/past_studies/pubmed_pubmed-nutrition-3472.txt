Study Title: Impact of Weight Management on Obesity-Driven Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer Progression.

Study Summary:
Excess body and visceral fat increase the risk of death from prostate cancer (PCa). This phase II study aimed to test whether weight reduction by > 5% total body weight counteracts obesity-driven PCa biomarkers. Forty men scheduled for prostatectomy were randomized into intervention (n = 20) or control (n = 20) arms. Intervention participants followed a weight management program for 4 to 16 weeks before and 6 months after surgery. Control participants received standardized educational materials. All participants attended visits at baseline, 1 week before surgery, and 6 months after surgery. Circulating immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines were evaluated. Weight loss, body composition/distribution, quality of life, and nutrition literacy were assessed. Prostate tissue samples obtained from biopsy and surgery were analyzed. From baseline to surgery (mean = 5 weeks), the intervention group achieved 5.5% of weight loss (95% CI, 4%-7%). Compared to the control, the intervention also reduced insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, leptin, leptin:adiponectin ratio, and visceral adipose tissue. The intervention group had reduced c-peptide, plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1, and T cell count from baseline to surgery. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells were not statistically different by group. Intervention group anthropometrics improved, including visceral and overall fat loss. No prostate tissue markers changed significantly. Quality of life measures of general and emotional health improved in the intervention group. The intervention group maintained or kept losing to a net loss of 11% initial body weight (95% CI, 8%-14%) at the study end. Our study demonstrated improvements in body composition, PCa biomarkers, and quality of life with a weight management intervention.
