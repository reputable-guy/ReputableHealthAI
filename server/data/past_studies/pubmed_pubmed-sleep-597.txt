Study Title: Benefits of Individualized Training in Fatigued Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

Study Summary:
Chronic fatigue is the most common and debilitating symptom in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Recently, exercise has been proven to alleviate chronic fatigue and improve physical functions. Tailoring the training intervention to the potential fatigue causes could optimize the beneficial effects of training on fatigue. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an individualized (IND) versus a traditional (TRAD) exercise intervention in reducing chronic fatigue. Twenty-nine PwMS with high chronic fatigue were randomly assigned to 12 wk of either a TRAD or IND exercise intervention. TRAD comprised aerobic and resistance exercises according to the guidelines for PwMS. IND specifically addressed identified individual weaknesses. Participants visited the laboratory before and after training for the following assessments: patient-reported outcomes (fatigue, quality of life, depression questionnaires), incremental cycling test (peak oxygen uptake (V&#x307;O 2peak )), and cycling fatigue test (maximal voluntary contraction, rating of perceived exertion). Similar improvements in fatigue, depression, and quality of life were observed between groups ( P > 0.05). Compared with TRAD, IND induced a significant greater increase in V&#x307;O 2peak (+21.0% &#xb1; 13.9% vs 6.8% &#xb1; 11.5%, P < 0.05) and a greater reduction in rating of perceived exertion at a given submaximal intensity (-30.3% &#xb1; 18.9% vs -12.1% &#xb1; 20.4%, P < 0.001), whereas maximal voluntary contraction increased similarly in both groups ( P > 0.05). Although tailored exercise improved similarly fatigue and other subjective parameters (depression, quality of life, sleep quality) compared with than traditional exercise intervention, prescribing an individualized intervention led to greater improvement in V&#x307;O 2peak (but not maximal strength) and perception of effort. This may have positive functional consequences for patients.
