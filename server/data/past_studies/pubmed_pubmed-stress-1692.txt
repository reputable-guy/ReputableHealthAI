Study Title: Effect of pericapsular nerve group block and suprainguinal fascia iliaca block on postoperative analgesia and stress response in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty: a prospective randomized controlled double-blind trial.

Study Summary:
As a novel regional analgesic technique, ultrasound-guided pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block has some potential advantages, and we designed a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to investigate whether the ultrasound-guided PENG block combined with general anesthesia can better reduce stress response, maintain intraoperative hemodynamic stability, and reduce postoperative analgesia in elderly hip arthroplasty compared with ultrasound-guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca block (SIFIB) combined with general anesthesia. Seventy-four subjects were enrolled over an 8-month period (20 April 2023 to 31 December 2023). All patients were divided into the test group (group P) and the control group (group S) using the envelope as the randomization method. The test group was treated with preoperative ultrasound-guided PENG block analgesia combined with general anesthesia and the control group was treated with preoperative ultrasound-guided SIFIB analgesia combined with general anesthesia. The primary outcome selected was the patient Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score at 12&#xa0;h postoperatively. After generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in the main effect of postoperative VAS score in group P compared with group S (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009), the time effect of VAS score in each group was significantly different (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and there was no statistically significant difference in the group-time interaction effect (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.069). There was no statistically significant difference in the main effect of intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) change (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.911), there were statistically significant differences in the time effect of MAP in each group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and there were statistically significant differences in the interaction effect (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). In summary, we can conclude that in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, postoperative analgesia is more pronounced, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters are more stable, and intraoperative stress is less induced in patients receiving SIFIB than in patients receiving PENG block.
