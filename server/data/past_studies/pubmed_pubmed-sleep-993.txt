Study Title: Hypnosis Intervention for Sleep Disturbances in Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Poor sleep quality is highly prevalent among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Further, poor sleep quality is associated with reduced quality of life, increased stress response, memory impairments, and progression to dementia among individuals with MCI. Pharmacological treatments for sleep have mixed efficacy and can lead to dependency. Therefore, alternatives to pharmacological treatments for improving sleep among individuals with MCI are needed. The present study reports on the feasibility of a non-pharmacological self-administered hypnosis intervention focused on sleep quality in adults with MCI. It was hypothesized that the hypnosis intervention program would be feasible and have acceptable levels of adherence to daily hypnosis practice. A two-armed randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted using a sample of 21 adults with MCI. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to listen to either hypnosis audio recordings or sham hypnosis recordings for five weeks. Program feasibility, program adherence, pain intensity, stress, and sleep quality were measured using a daily home practice log, questionnaires, and wrist actigraphy. The results found mid or higher levels of treatment satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived effectiveness at one-week follow-up, with participants in the hypnosis arm reporting greater perceived benefit. Adherence to assigned audio recordings and meetings were likewise within acceptable margins in both groups. No intervention-related adverse events were reported in either treatment condition. Significant improvements in sleep quality, sleep duration, and daytime sleepiness were found for the hypnosis intervention. The results of this study can be used to inform future research on the effects of hypnosis on sleep quality in adults with MCI.
