Study Title: Effect of sexual counseling on sexual function and sexual quality of life for women undergoing open heart surgery: a pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Sexual counseling can improve or may have benefit to patients' sexual function after open heart surgery. The study aims to determine the effect of sexual counseling on sexual function and quality of sexual life with the PLISSIT model (ie, permission, limited information, specific suggestions, intensive therapy) for women undergoing open heart surgery. The study was a pilot randomized controlled trial. Seventy women who planned open heart surgery were randomly divided into the control group or the sexual counseling group between November 2020 and November 2021. In addition to routine care, sexual counseling with the PLISSIT model was given to women in the sexual counseling group for 12&#xa0;weeks after the operation. During the research, 6 PLISSIT sessions were conducted. Women in the control group received routine postoperative care, which included hospital-provided postoperative home care practices (medication, nutrition, physical activity). Data were obtained with an information form, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Female Sexual Function Index, and the Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire-Female. The women in the sexual counseling and control groups were similar in terms of sociodemographic, obstetric, gynecologic, general health, current heart disease, and sexual function data (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05). After sexual counseling with the PLISSIT model, scores on the Female Sexual Function Index and Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire-Female significantly increased in the sexual counseling group while Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). Comparisons were made within and between groups. Sexual counseling with the PLISSIT model is a useful and effective model for health professionals to improve the sexual function and sexual quality of life of women's who will undergo open heart surgery. The limitations of the study were as follows: only 1 assessment after the intervention ended, no short- or long-term follow-up, and a small sample size. Other limitations include the absence of controls for therapeutic context or positive expectations in the experimental group. Sexual counseling with the PLISSIT model after open heart surgery increased the sexual function and sexual quality of life of women while reducing the symptoms of depression.
