Study Title: Lutein and Zeaxanthin Supplementation Improves Dynamic Visual and Cognitive Performance in Children: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel, Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Supplementation with dietary neuro-pigments lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) has been shown to improve many aspects of visual and cognitive function in adults. In this study, we tested whether a similar intervention could improve such outcomes in preadolescent children. Sixty children (age range 5-12&#xa0;years) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio in this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were supplemented with gummies containing either a combination of 10&#xa0;mg lutein and 2&#xa0;mg zeaxanthin (LZ) or placebo for 180&#xa0;days. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included serum levels of L and Z, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), critical flicker fusion (CFF), eye strain and fatigue using visual analogue scales (VAS), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire-Abbreviated (CSHQ-A), and Creyos Health cognitive domains like attention, focus/concentration, episodic memory and learning, visuospatial working memory, and visuospatial processing speed. Safety was assessed throughout the study on the basis of physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and monitoring of adverse events. The LZ group showed significant increases in MPOD at all visits post-supplementation, with significant increases as early as day&#xa0;42 compared to placebo. The LZ group showed significant increases in serum lutein levels, reduced eye strain and fatigue, and improved cognitive performance (focus, episodic memory and learning, visuospatial working memory) at days&#xa0;90 and 180 compared to placebo. Further, the LZ group showed significant increases in processing speed (CFF), attention, visuospatial processing, and serum Z and BDNF levels on day&#xa0;180 compared to placebo. No safety concerns were observed. Supplementing LZ resulted in increased MPOD levels, along with increased serum levels of L, Z, and BDNF. These changes were associated with improved visual and cognitive performances and reduction in eye strain and eye fatigue in the children receiving LZ gummies. The investigational product was safe and well tolerated. http://ctri.nic.in/ Identifier CTRI/2022/05/042364.
