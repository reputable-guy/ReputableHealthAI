Study Title: Improved patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes distinguish tacrolimus 0.03% from crisaborole in children with atopic dermatitis.

Study Summary:
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease that affects 20% of children worldwide and is associated with low patient-reported quality of life (QoL). Crisaborole (CRIS) and tacrolimus 0.03% (TAC) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved topical treatments for mild to moderate AD with similar clinical efficacy. Utilization of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) may provide meaningful data on the impact of AD treatments on patients and caregivers. This study used PROs to monitor the impact of crisaborole (CRIS) and tacrolimus 0.03% (TAC) on children with mild/moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) and caregiver burden. This open-label study randomized 47 child-caregiver dyads to CRIS or TAC for 12&#x2009;weeks. Disease severity, child quality of life (QoL), itch, pain interference, anxiety, depression, sleep, caregiver burden and caregiver QoL were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12&#x2009;weeks. A total of 36 dyads completed the study. Children (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.9&#x2009;years) had mild baseline AD and were diverse by race (39% white; 36% Black) and gender (53% males). Caregivers were mostly female (78%; mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;37&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.6&#x2009;years). Both arms improved disease severity (Eczema Area and Severity Index) from baseline to 12&#x2009;weeks (CRIS&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.4 vs. TAC&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.9). Within-arm analyses comparing baseline to 12&#x2009;weeks revealed TAC, but not CRIS, improved all child and caregiver PROs except sleep (all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Our results demonstrated that topical treatment for 12&#x2009;weeks was more beneficial than 6&#x2009;weeks, with TAC improving more PROs than CRIS. Future trials should implement PROs to fully understand the impact of AD treatments.
