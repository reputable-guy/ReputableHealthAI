Study Title: Protective effects of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate postconditioning on myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing valve replacement: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Pharmacological postconditioning can protect against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury during cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. The aim of this study was to observe the protective effects of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FDP) postconditioning on myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement with extracorporeal circulation. Patients undergoing elective mitral valve replacement and/or aortic valve replacement were divided into normal saline postconditioning group (NS group) and FDP postconditioning group (FDP group). The primary outcome was the plasma concentration of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). The secondary outcomes were the plasma concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, CK, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, the spontaneous cardiac rhythm recovery profile, the extracorporeal circulation time and duration of surgery, intensive care unit and postoperative hospitalization. Forty patients were randomly assigned to receive intervention and included in the analysis. The serum concentrations of CK-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, CK, cardiac troponin I, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at T1&#x223c;4 were lower in the FDP group than in the NS group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Compared with the NS group, the dosage of dopamine administered 1-90 min after cardiac resuscitation, the spontaneous cardiac rhythm recovery time and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation were lower in the FDP group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.040, respectively). The values of ST- changes were increased more significantly in the NS group than in the FDP group (median [standard deviation] 1.3 [0.3] mm vs 0.7 [0.2] mm; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Compared with the NS group, the time of recovery of ST-segment deviations was shorter in the FDP group (50.3 [12.3] min vs 34.6 [6.9] min; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The FDP postconditioning could improve both myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and the spontaneous cardiac rhythm recovery during cardiac valve surgery with extracorporeal circulation.
