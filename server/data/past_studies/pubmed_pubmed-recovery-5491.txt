Study Title: Short-Term Cocoa Supplementation Influences Microbiota Composition and Serum Markers of Lipid Metabolism in Elite Male Soccer Players.

Study Summary:
Dietary strategies to improve arachidonic acid:eicosapentaenoic acid (AA:EPA) ratios are of interest due to potential reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress following exercise. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a novel dietary intervention, that is, the ingestion of 30&#xa0;g of dark chocolate, on blood lipid profiles and gut microbiota composition in elite male soccer players. Professional male soccer players were randomly assigned to the experimental group (DC) provided with 30&#xa0;g of dark chocolate or to the control group (WC), provided with 30&#xa0;g of white chocolate, for 30&#xa0;days. Before and after intervention, blood, fecal sample, and anthropometry data were collected. For each outcome, two-way repeated-measure analysis of variance was used to identify differences between baseline and endpoint (Week 4), considering treatment (dark chocolate, white chocolate) as intersubjects' factors. Metagenomic analysis was performed following the general guidelines, which relies on the bioBakery computational environment. DC group showed increased plasma polyphenols (from 154.7 &#xb1; 18.6&#xa0;&#x3bc;g gallic acid equivalents/ml to 185.11 &#xb1; 57.6&#xa0;&#x3bc;g gallic acid equivalents/ml, &#x394; pre vs. post = +30.41 &#xb1; 21.50) and significant improvements in lipid profiles: total cholesterol (&#x394; -32.47 &#xb1; 17.18&#xa0;mg/dl DC vs. &#x394; -2.84 &#xb1; 6.25&#xa0;mg/dl WC, Time &#xd7; Treatment interaction p < .001), triglycerides (&#x394; -6.32 &#xb1; 4.96&#xa0;mg/dl DC vs. &#x394; -0.42 &#xb1; 6.47&#xa0;mg/dl WC, Time &#xd7; Treatment interaction p < .001), low-density lipoprotein (&#x394; -18.42 &#xb1; 17.13&#xa0;mg/dl vs. &#x394; -2.05 &#xb1; 5.19&#xa0;mg/dl WC, Time &#xd7; Treatment interaction p < .001), AA/EPA ratio (&#x394; -5.26 &#xb1; 2.35; -54.1% DC vs. &#x394; -0.47 &#xb1; 0.73, -6.41% WC, Time &#xd7; Treatment interaction p < .001) compared with WC group. In addition, 4&#xa0;weeks of intervention showed a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein concentration in DC group (&#x394; + 3.26 &#xb1; 4.49&#xa0;mg/dl DC vs. &#x394; -0.79 &#xb1; 5.12&#xa0;mg/dl WC). Microbial communities in the DC group maintained a slightly higher microbial stability over time (exhibiting lower within-subject community dissimilarity). Ingesting 30&#xa0;g of dark chocolate over 4&#xa0;weeks positively improved AA:EPA ratio and maintained gut microbial stability. Dark chocolate ingestion represents an effective nutritional strategy to improve blood lipid profiles in professional soccer players. What Are the Findings? Ingesting 30&#xa0;g of dark chocolate for 4&#xa0;weeks positively influences blood lipid AA: EPA ratio while maintaining gut microbial stability. What This Study Adds? Dietary intake of specific foods such as dark chocolate represents an alternative strategy to support the health and recovery of elite soccer players. What Impact Might This Have on Clinical Practice in the Future? From a clinical and translational perspective, dark chocolate ingestion positively modulates favorable blood lipid profiles and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism while maintaining gut microbial stability. Dark chocolate ingestion may be considered as an effective nutritional strategy in elite sport environments during periods of high-intensity training and congested competitions. Further research is required to determine functional outcomes associated with the observed improvements in blood lipid profiles.
