Study Title: Hydrolyzed collagen supplementation prior to resistance exercise augments collagen synthesis in a dose-response manner in resistance-trained, middle-aged men.

Study Summary:
Resistance exercise (RE) increases collagen synthesis in young and older men, whereas hydrolyzed collagen (HC) ingestion improves this response to RE in a dose-response manner in young men. However, the collagen synthesis response to RE with and without HC in middle-aged men is unknown. Eight resistance-trained men (age: 49 &#xb1; 8 yr; height: 1.78 &#xb1; 0.02 m; mass: 90 &#xb1; 4 kg) took part in this double-blind, crossover design study and undertook 4 &#xd7; 10 repetitions of lower-limb RE at maximum load, after consuming 0 g, 15 g, or 30 g vitamin C-enriched HC. We analyzed venous blood samples for N-terminal propeptide of type 1 pro-collagen (PINP), &#x3b2;-isomerized C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (&#x3b2;-CTx), and 18 collagen amino acids throughout all three interventions. The serum PINP concentration &#xd7; time area-under-the-curve (AUC) was higher following 30 g (169 &#xb1; 28 &#xb5;g/mL &#xd7; h) than 15 g (134 &#xb1; 23 &#xb5;g/mL &#xd7; h,< 0.05) HC ingestion, and both 15 g and 30 g were higher than 0 g HC (96 &#xb1; 23 &#xb5;g/mL &#xd7; h,< 0.05). RE with 0 g HC showed no change in serum PINP concentration. The AUCs for glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, alanine, arginine, lysine, serine, leucine, valine, and isoleucine were greater with 30 g than 15 g and 0 g HC ingestion (< 0.05) and greater with 15 g than 0 g HC ingestion (< 0.05). Plasma &#x3b2;-CTx concentration decreased after RE independently of HC dose. Our study suggests connective tissue anabolic resistance to RE in middle-aged men but ingesting 15 g HC rescues the collagen synthesis response and 30 g augments that response further. This dose response is associated with the increased bioavailability of collagen amino acids in the blood, which stimulate collagen synthesis.This study is the first to document the dose-response effect of hydrolyzed collagen (HC) ingestion before resistance exercise (RE) on collagen turnover in middle-aged, resistance-trained men. Strikingly, RE alone did not increase collagen synthesis (suggesting connective tissue anabolic resistance), but ingesting 15 g HC rescued the collagen synthesis response and 30 g augmented that response further. These results were associated with the increased bioavailability of collagen amino acids in the blood, which stimulate collagen synthesis.
