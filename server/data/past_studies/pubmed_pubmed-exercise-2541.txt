Study Title: Feasibility Study of Community-Based Training for Musculoskeletal Health Promotion.

Study Summary:
To minimize fracture risk, multimodal training regimens are recommended. However, their effectiveness in community settings remains uncertain. This study evaluated the feasibility of 19-weeks of multimodal training in a local community center with emphasis on musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women.In a controlled trial, 28 postmenopausal women (53-68-years-old) were assigned to a multimodal training group (MMT, n=15) or a control group (CON, n=13). The training consisted of high- and odd-impact, resistance and balance-coordination training 1-2 hours weekly. The outcomes were attendance rate, regional and total bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone turnover markers (BTM), body composition, functional muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance. All were determined at baseline and after 19 weeks of training. BTM was assessed after three weeks.Overall, 22(79%) participants (MMT, n=9; CON, n=13) completed the study, and the mean attendance rate for MMT was 65.5% of the maximum sessions (2) offered. Only right trochanter BMD increased (p<0.05) by 1.0&#xb1;1.1% in MMT, which was higher(p<0.05) than CON. While whole-body BMC was not changed at 19 weeks from baseline in MMT, it decreased (p<0.05) in CON resulting in a significant difference (p<0.05) in whole-body BMC delta values between the two groups. Compared to baseline, body fat percentage(%BF), fat mass(FM), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-mass and -volume were decreased (p<0.01) in MMT, and were larger (p<0.05) than CON. No significant changes were observed in BTM, muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance after 19 weeks.Nineteen weeks of multimodal training 1-2 hours per week in a local community had a health-enhancing effect on %BF, FM, and VAT, whereas the musculoskeletal health impact was modest. We hypothesize that the reason might be too low training volume and frequency and supposedly too low musculoskeletal training intensity for some participants.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05164679 (21/12/2021).
