Study Title: Patients&#xb4; experiences of an exercise intervention in primary care following robot-assisted radical cystectomy due to bladder cancer: a qualitative study.

Study Summary:
Physical activity is thought to be a key component in reducing postoperative complications following major abdominal surgery. The available literature on exercise interventions following radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer is scarce but suggests that physical activity and exercise might improve physical function and health-related quality of life, thus calling for further investigation. The CanMoRe-trial is a single-blinded randomised controlled trial (Clinicals Trials NCT03998579 25/06/2019), aimed at evaluating the impact of an exercise intervention in primary care following robot-assisted radical cystectomy. This study seeks to explore patients' experiences of the exercise intervention in the CanMoRe-trial to gain a better understanding of facilitating aspects and potential barriers. A qualitative study was conducted involving 20 patients from the intervention group of the CanMoRe-trial who were interviewed individually between October 2020 and March 2023 using a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Four main themes were identified: Having to adapt to new circumstances, describing the challenges regarding physical activity patients face after discharge. Optimising conditions for rehabilitation, describing how practical conditions affect patients' ability to exercise. Motivated to get back to normal, describing patients&#xb4; desire to get back to normal life and factors influencing motivation. Importance of a supportive environment, describing the impact of social support, support from physiotherapists, and how the environment where exercise takes place impacts patients' ability to exercise. This study found that patients participating in the CanMoRe-trial are positive towards physical exercise in PC following radical RARC. They are motivated to get back to normal life but face major challenges when arriving home following surgery, which affect their ability to perform physical activity and engage in exercise. Conditions need to be optimised to support patients' ability to engage in exercise by providing an accessible PC location to perform exercise in. A supportive environment is also needed, including guidance from healthcare professionals regarding which type of exercise, intensity and amount of exercise that should be performed, enabling patients gradually to develop self-efficacy regarding exercise and focusing on goals related to patients' normal lives before surgery.
