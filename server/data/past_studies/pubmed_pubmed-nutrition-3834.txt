Study Title: Addressing nutrition and physical activity in substance use disorder treatment: Client reports from a wellness-oriented, tobacco-free policy intervention.

Study Summary:
Interest in wellness interventions in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is growing although evidence remains limited. This study evaluated nutrition, physical activity, nutrition and physical activity counseling, and relationships of counseling with wellness behavior before and after a wellness-oriented, tobacco-free policy intervention in 17 residential SUD programs. Clients completed cross-sectional surveys reporting sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, physical activity, and receipt of nutrition and physical activity counseling before (n= 434) and after (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;422) an 18-month intervention. Multivariable regression models assessed pre-post-intervention differences in these variables and examined associations of nutrition counseling with sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and physical activity counseling with physical activity. Post-intervention clients were 83% more likely than pre-intervention clients to report nutrition counseling (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024). There were no pre-post- differences for other variables. Past week sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was 22% lower among clients reporting nutrition counseling than for those who did not (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008) and this association did not vary by time (pre/post). There was a significant interaction of physical activity counseling receipt by time on past week physical activity (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008). Pre-intervention clients reporting physical activity counseling had 22% higher physical activity than those who did not; post-intervention clients reporting physical activity counseling had 47% higher physical activity. A wellness policy intervention was associated with increased nutrition counseling. Nutrition counseling predicted lower sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. Physical activity counseling predicted higher physical activity, an association that was greater post-intervention. Adding wellness components to tobacco-related interventions may promote health among SUD clients.
