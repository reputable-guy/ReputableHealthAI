Study Title: The effects of equine-assisted activities on execution function in children aged 7-8 years: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study examines the effects of equine-assisted activity (EAA) training on executive functioning (EF) (inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) in children aged 7-8 years. Twenty-Four healthy children aged 7-8 years with a 1:1 ratio of boys to girls were randomly divided into EAA group (EAAG) or control group (CG). The subjects in EAAG were trained for 12 weeks, and CG participated in normal daily activities. All subjects conducted the Flanker, 1-Back, and More-odd shifting tasks at rest and recorded the average reaction times (RTs) and accuracy data of each task. After 12 weeks of EAA intervention, EAAG showed a highly significant increase (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.01) in mean RTs and accuracy in the Flanker and More-odd shifting tasks and a highly significant increase (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.01) in accuracy only in 1-Back. These findings suggest that 12-week EAA training can be effective in improving EF and promoting cognitive performance in children aged 7-8 years.
