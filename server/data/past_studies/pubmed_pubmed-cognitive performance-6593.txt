Study Title: Lower Extremity Open Skill Training Effects on Perception of Visual Stimuli, Cognitive Processing, and Performance.

Study Summary:
This study investigates if lower extremity open-skill training impacts perception and cognitive processing abilities or just influences task related motor abilities. Twenty-two participants (24.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.4years; 11 males, 11 females) were randomly allocated either into the group that trained on a computerized device or to the control group. Prior to and following the 4-week study period, motor performance was assessed using drop jump, hexagon test, postural control and lower extremity choice reaction. Perception, cognitive processing and task inhibition were captured using validated neurocognitive tests. Repeated measurements analyses of co-variances (ANCOVAs) were performed. They revealed a time (before and after intervention) &#xd7; group (training vs. control) effect on lower extremity choice reaction and hexagon (< .05). No effects on group differences or between groups in cognitive performance were found. A detrimental effect of training on accuracy of task inhibition (lower percentage of correct inhibitions) was detected. Computerized open skill training affects specific movement patterns without increasing task-relevant cognitive or perceptual abilities. Indicated by the lower percentage of correct inhibitions, the training might further detrimentally influence the risk-taking behavior during choice reaction tasks.
