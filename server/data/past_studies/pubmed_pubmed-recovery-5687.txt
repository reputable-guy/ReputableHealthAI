Study Title: Optimizing Recovery in Elderly Patients: Anabolic Benefits of Glucose Supplementation during the Rehydration Period.

Study Summary:
Since many acutely admitted older adults display signs of dehydration, treatment using balanced crystalloids is an important part of medical care. Additionally, many of these patients suffer from chronic malnutrition. We speculated that the early addition of glucose might ameliorate the hospital-related drop of caloric intake and modify their catabolic status. We included patients 78 years and older, admitted acutely for non-traumatic illnesses. The patients were randomized into either receiving balanced crystalloid (PlasmaLyte; group P) or balanced crystalloid enriched with 100 g of glucose per liter (group G). The information about fluid balance and levels of minerals were collected longitudinally. In the G group, a significantly higher proportion of patients developed signs of refeeding syndrome, i.e., drops in phosphates, potassium and/or magnesium when compared to group P (83.3 vs. 16.7%,< 0.01). The drop in phosphate levels was the most pronounced. The urinalysis showed no differences in the levels of these minerals in the urine, suggesting their uptake into the cells. There were no differences in the in-hospital mortality or in the 1-year mortality. The short-term administration of balanced crystalloids with glucose induced an anabolic shift of electrolytes in acutely admitted older adults.
