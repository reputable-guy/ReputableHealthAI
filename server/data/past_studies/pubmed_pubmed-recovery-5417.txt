Study Title: Application of combined anesthesia with spontaneous breathing in the surgery of intertrochanteric fracture of femur in elderly patients.

Study Summary:
This study aims to investigate the feasibility and safety of combined anesthesia with spontaneous breathing in the operation of intertrochanteric fracture of femur in the elderly. Between January 2020 and January 2023, a total of 141 elderly patients (45 males, 96 females; mean age: 72.5&#xb1;6.8 years; range, 65 to 87 years) who underwent proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) surgery for intertrochanteric fracture of femur were included in this single-blind, prospective, randomized-controlled study. The patients were randomly divided into three groups. Group A (experimental group) was a general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway (LMA) group preserving spontaneous breathing, Group B (control group 1) was a general anesthesia with LMA group for mechanical ventilation, and Group C (control group 2) was a tracheal intubation anesthesia group for mechanical ventilation. The differences of related indexes among the three groups were compared. The mean onset time of anesthesia (6.23&#xb1;1.45 vs. 12.78&#xb1;2.78 vs. 13.73&#xb1;2.43 min), postoperative recovery time of consciousness (8.13&#xb1;0.83 vs. 11.34&#xb1;0.89 vs. 12.45&#xb1;0.86 min), and postoperative complete awakening time (10.45&#xb1;2.34 vs. 18.87&#xb1;2.56 vs. 19.62&#xb1;2.93 min) were significantly shorter in Group A than in Groups B and C (p<0.05). The duration of analgesic effect was longer in Group A than in Groups B and C (p<0.05). After anesthesia, the Ramsay Sedation Scale and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were significantly lower in Group A than the other groups (p<0.05). The mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMS) scores were significantly higher in Group A than in Groups B and C (p<0.05). Hemodynamic parameters showed that blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and cardiac index (CI) levels were significantly higher in Group A than the other groups (p<0.05). Our study results indicate that combined anesthesia preserving spontaneous breathing is safe and feasible in the operation of intertrochanteric fracture of femur in the elderly, with faster anesthesia recovery than the mechanical ventilation group.
