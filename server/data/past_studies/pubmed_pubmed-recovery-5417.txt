Study Title: Adjunctive N-Acetylcysteine and Lung Function in Pulmonary Tuberculosis.

Study Summary:
Tuberculosis remains a global health concern, and half of cured patients have permanent lung injury. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown beneficial antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects in preclinical tuberculosis models. We examined its effects on tuberculosis treatment outcomes. This prospective, randomized, controlled trial nested within the TB SEQUEL cohort study enrolled 140 adults with moderate or far-advanced tuberculosis. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to standard therapy with or without 1200&#x2009;mg of oral NAC twice daily for days 1 to 112. Clinical evaluations, sputum culture, and spirometry were performed at specified intervals through day 168, after which participants returned to the TB SEQUEL cohort. The primary outcome was culture conversion. Secondary outcomes included whole-blood glutathione levels and lung function. Participants were predominantly young, male, and human immunodeficiency virus 1-negative and had heavy sputum(MTB) infection burdens. NAC increased glutathione levels (NAC &#xd7; day interaction, 8.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93 to 15.02) but did not increase stable culture conversion (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.20; P=0.33). NAC treatment was associated with improved recovery of lung function (NAC &#xd7; month, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.95] and 0.42 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.91] for forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in the first second, respectively, as percentages of predicted values). The effects of NAC on lung function were greatest in participants with severe baseline lung impairment and appeared to persist beyond the period of NAC administration. Rates of serious or grade 3 to 4 nonserious adverse events did not differ between the groups. Despite increasing whole-blood glutathione levels, NAC did not affect eradication of MTB infection in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis that was moderate to far advanced. Secondary outcomes of lung function showed changes that merit further investigation.
