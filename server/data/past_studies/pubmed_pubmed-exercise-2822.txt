Study Title: The effect of sodium bicarbonate mini-tablets ingested in a carbohydrate hydrogel system on 40&#xa0;km cycling time trial performance and metabolism in trained male cyclists.

Study Summary:
Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO) ingestion has been found to be ergogenic in high-intensity exercise that ranges from 1 to 10&#xa0;min; however, limited studies have investigated high-intensity exercise beyond this duration. The present study aimed to determine the effect of NaHCOingested using a carbohydrate hydrogel delivery system on 40&#xa0;km time trial (TT) performance in trained male cyclists. Fourteen trained male cyclists ingested 0.3&#xa0;g&#xa0;kgBM NaHCO(Maurten AB, Sweden) to determine individualised peak alkalosis, which established time of ingestion prior to exercise. Participants completed a 40&#xa0;km familiarisation TT, and two 40&#xa0;km experimental TTs after ingestion of either NaHCOor placebo in a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. NaHCOsupplementation improved performance (mean improvement&#x2009;=&#x2009;54.14&#xa0;s&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;18.16&#xa0;s; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22) and increased blood buffering capacity prior to (HCOmean increase&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.2&#xa0;mmol&#xa0;L, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and throughout exercise (f&#x2009;=&#x2009;84.82, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, p&#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.87) compared to placebo. There were no differences in total gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) between conditions either pre- (NaHCO, 22 AU; Placebo, 44 AU; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.088, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46) or post-exercise (NaHCO, 76 AU; Placebo, 63 AU; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.606, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.14). The present study suggests that ingesting NaHCOmini-tablets in a carbohydrate hydrogel can enhance 40&#xa0;km TT performance in trained male cyclists, with minimal GIS. This ingestion strategy could therefore be considered by cyclists looking for a performance enhancing ergogenic aid.
