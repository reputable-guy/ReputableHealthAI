Study Title: Circulating CD31Angiogenic T cells are reduced in prediabetes and increase with exercise training.

Study Summary:
To investigate circulating angiogenic cells in adults with prediabetes and the effect of a structured exercise program. A cohort of adults with overweight/obesity and either normal glucose (NG) or prediabetes were randomised to receive exercise (Exercise) (as twice weekly supervised combined high intensity aerobic exercise and progressive resistance training, and once weekly home-based aerobic exercise) or an unsupervised stretching intervention (Control) for 12&#xa0;weeks. Circulating angiogenic T cells, muscle strength, and cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood lipids, arterial stiffness, central haemodynamic responses, and cardiorespiratory fitness (VOpeak) in those with prediabetes (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;35, 16 Control, 19 Exercise) and NG (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;37, 17 Control, 20 Exercise) were analysed at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. At baseline, compared with NG those with prediabetes demonstrated reduced VOpeak, angiogenic CD31CD8T cells and VEGFR2CD4T cells, and increased systolic blood pressure. CD31T cells were negatively correlated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Compared with Control, exercise training increased muscle strength, VOpeak, and CD31CD4and CD31CD8T cells in NG and prediabetes. Circulating angiogenic CD31T cells are decreased in people with prediabetes and are enhanced with exercise training. Exercise increases CD31T cells, and through this mechanism it is proposed that it may reduce CVD risk. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12617000552381.
