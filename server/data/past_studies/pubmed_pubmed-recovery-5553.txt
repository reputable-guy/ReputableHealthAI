Study Title: Effects of pregabalin combined with tramadol/paracetamol on acute pain in patients with CT-guided puncture localization of pulmonary nodules.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effects of pregabalin combined with tramadol/paracetamol on acute pain in patients with CT-guided puncture localization of pulmonary nodules. In this randomized, placebo-controlled and single-center study, 120 patients were allocated randomly to four groups: the control group (Group P), the pregabalin-placebo group (Group BP), the tramadol/paracetamol-placebo group (Group AP), and the pregabalin-tramadol/paracetamol group (Group AB). The primary outcome was the NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) score. Other outcomes included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO), the incidence of moderate to severe pain, the analgesia recovery ratio, the incidence of adverse drug reactions and patients' satisfaction. No significant interaction was detected between the interventions (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.752). The NRS score of the Taking pregabalin group and the Taking tramadol/paracetamol group were significantly lower than those of the Not-taking pregabalin group and the Not-taking tramadol/paracetamol group respectively (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). There was significant difference in the NRS scores among the four groups (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). The NRS score of Group AB was significantly lower than that of Group P (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), Group BP (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and Group AP (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). At the same time, the NRS scores of Group BP (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and Group AP (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) were significantly lower than those of Group P, but there was no significant difference between Group BP and Group AP (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.000). The SBP, DBP, HR, the incidence of moderate to severe pain and the analgesia recovery ratio of Group AB were significantly lower than those of Group P (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), while the SpOand the number of people who were very satisfied were significantly higher than those of Group P (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse drug reactions among the four groups (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.272). The combination or single use of pregabalin and tramadol/paracetamol can effectively relieve the acute pain after localization. Pregabalin combined with tramadol/paracetamol has the best analgesic effect and significantly reduces the hemodynamic fluctuations, with high safety and low incidence of adverse drug reactions, which has a certain clinical popularization and application value.
