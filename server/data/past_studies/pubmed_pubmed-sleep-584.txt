Study Title: Ingestion of &#x3b2;-nicotinamide mononucleotide increased blood NAD levels, maintained walking speed, and improved sleep quality in older adults in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study.

Study Summary:
The study evaluated how ingestion of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) for 12&#xa0;weeks by older adults affected blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&#x2009;+) levels and physical function, particularly walking function. Information concerning sleep, and stress was also collected as secondary endpoints. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparison study, 60 participants were randomly allocated into a placebo group or NMN group. Members of the NMN group consumed 250&#xa0;mg/day NMN for 12&#xa0;weeks. Motor function tests, blood NAD metabolite analysis, and questionnaires were conducted at the start of the study and 4 and 12&#xa0;weeks after intake. This trial was registered at umin.ac.jp/ctr as UMIN000047871 on June 22nd, 2022.At primary outcome, at both 4&#xa0;weeks and 12&#xa0;weeks, the NMN and placebo groups had no significant differences in a stepping test. At secondary outcomes, after 12&#xa0;weeks of NMN intake, the NMN group had a significantly shorter 4-m walking time than the placebo group as well as significantly higher blood levels of NAD&#x2009;+&#x2009;and its metabolites. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change in the 4-m walking time and the change in blood NAD&#x2009;+&#x2009;, N-methyl-2-pridone-5-carboxamide (2-PY), and N-methyl-4-pridone-3-carboxamide (4-PY) at 12&#xa0;weeks. The NMN group had improved sleep quality at 12&#xa0;weeks relative to the placebo group as evidenced by lower scores for "Daytime dysfunction" and "Global PSQI" on the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire. No adverse effects related to test substance consumption were observed. Together, these results indicate that NMN intake could increase blood NAD&#x2009;+&#x2009;levels, maintain walking speed, and improve sleep quality in older adults. Interventions involving NMN aimed at maintaining walking speed could contribute to extended healthy life expectancy.
