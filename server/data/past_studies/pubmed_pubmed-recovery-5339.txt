Study Title: Recognition of Traumatic Brain Injury as a Chronic Condition: A Commentary.

Study Summary:
Many clinicians believe that residual impairments due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) are static once initial recovery has plateaued. That is, the effects of the injury are not expected to change significantly over the remainder of a person's life. This assumption has been called into question by several independent longitudinal studies showing that the long-term course of TBI may be better characterized asrather than static. Health care services that recognize brain injury as a chronic condition would encourage education on self-management to improve or protect health, as well as proactive health care that anticipates common co-morbidities. Those who have had a TBI would be encouraged to engage in lifestyles that optimize wellness. Almost all developed countries commit additional public health resources to addressing chronic conditions. In the United States, specific benefits are available from health insurance plans, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, for persons experiencing chronic health conditions. Potentially the most important benefit would derive from health care practitioners becoming aware of the dynamic nature of chronic brain injury and thus being more attentive to how their patients could be better served to optimize improvement and minimize decline. Recognition of TBI as a chronic condition would not only focus more resources on problems associated with living with brain injury but would also enhance both the public's and professionals' awareness of how to optimize the health and well-being of persons living with the effects of TBI.
