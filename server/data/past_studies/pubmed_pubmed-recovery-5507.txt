Study Title: rTMS for Poststroke Pusher Syndrome: A Randomized, Patient-Blinded Controlled Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Patients with poststroke pusher syndrome (PS) require longer duration of rehabilitation and more supplemental care after discharge. Effective treatment of PS remains a challenge. The role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for PS has not been examined. Assess the efficacy of rTMS for patients with poststroke PS in reducing pushing behavior, enhancing motor recovery and improving mobility. A randomized, patient- and assessor-blinded sham-controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Thirty-four eligible patients with poststroke PS were randomly allocated to receive either rTMS or sham rTMS for 2&#x2009;weeks. Pushing behavior on the Burke lateropulsion scale and scale for contraversive pushing, motor function on Fugl-Meyer assessment scale-motor domain (FMA-m) and mobility on modified Rivermead mobility index were measured at baseline, 1 and 2&#x2009;weeks after intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance was used for data analysis. There was no significant interaction between intervention and time on Burke lateropulsion scale (&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.747,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.076), scale for contraversive pushing (&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.583,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.214), or change of modified Rivermead mobility index (&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.183,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.297). However, a significant interaction between intervention and time was observed for FMA-m (&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.464,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.019). Post hoc comparisons of FMA-m show better improvement in rTMS group with mean differences of 12.7 (95% CI -7.3 to 32.7) and 15.7 (95% CI -4.6 to 36.0) at post-treatment week 1 and week 2 respectively. rTMS did not demonstrate significant efficacy in improving pushing behavior and mobility in patients with PS. However, rTMS might have potential effect in enhancing motor function for patients with PS.
