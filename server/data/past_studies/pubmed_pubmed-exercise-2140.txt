Study Title: The effects of 3-month supplementation with synbiotic on patient-reported outcomes, exercise tolerance, and brain and muscle metabolism in adult patients with post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome (STOP-FATIGUE): a randomized Placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Considering the observed gastrointestinal issues linked to post-COVID-19 myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), beneficially modulating the gut microbiota could offer a safe, cost-effective nutritional strategy. This trial aimed to evaluate the effects of medium-term synbiotic supplementation on patient-reported outcomes, exercise tolerance, and tissue metabolism in patients with post-COVID-19 ME/CFS. Between September 2022 and December 2023, we investigated the impact of 3-month supplementation with a synbiotic mixture including L. rhamnosus DSM 32550, Humiome&#xae; L. plantarum DSM 34532, B. lactis DSM 32269, B. longum DSM 32946, fructooligosaccharides and zinc, on predetermined primary and secondary outcome measures in twenty six post-COVID-19 ME/CFS patients utilizing a parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. Both the synbiotic and placebo intake resulted in a significant reduction in general fatigue after 3&#xa0;months compared to the baseline values (P&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05). This was accompanied by a significant interaction effect (time vs. treatment) for post-exercise malaise (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), with synbiotic superior to placebo to attenuate post-exercise malaise. The synbiotic also demonstrated a significant advantage over placebo in increasing choline levels at the thalamus (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), and creatine levels at left frontal white matter (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) and left frontal grey matter (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Taking the synbiotic mixture for three months improves tissue metabolism and mitigates clinical features of post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. The presented data show promise in addressing the widespread issue of ME/CFS following the COVID-19 pandemic; however, further validation is needed before endorsing the synbiotics within this clinical context. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06013072).
