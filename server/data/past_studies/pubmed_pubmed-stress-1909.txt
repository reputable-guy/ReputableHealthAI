Study Title: Effects of a choral program combining wind instrument performance and breathing training on respiratory function, stress, and quality of life in adolescents: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Choral activities are correlated with various health and wellbeing parameters. However, an intervention combining a music program using wind instruments and choral activities has not yet been investigated. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of a 12-week intervention combining a wind instrument performance program and a choral program on stress factors, quality of life, and respiratory function in adolescents located in a metropolitan city with exposure to air pollution. This randomized controlled trial consisted of 50 adolescents, and the subjects were randomly assigned to a combination wind instrument and choral training group, a choral training group, and a control group. Following a 12-week intervention program, respiratory function, stress factors, and quality of life were compared between the three groups. Regarding respiratory function, with the exception of maximal inspiratory pressure, all measured variables exhibited an interaction to indicate a variation in the pattern of change(p<0.05). Furthermore, regarding stress factors and quality of life, all measured variables exhibited an interaction to indicate a variation in the pattern of change(p<0.05). As a result of the post-hoc analysis, significant differences were found in all variables in experimental group 1 compared to other groups (p<0.05). The results showed that the 12-week intervention combining a wind instrument performance program and a choral program had positive effects in improving the respiratory function, stress factors, and quality of life in adolescents. This study findings are expected to support future studies aimed at promoting overall health including respiratory function and psychological factors through various music-based programs.
