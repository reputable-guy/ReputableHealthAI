Study Title: Pharmacokinetics, Mass Balance, Safety, and Tolerability of Obeldesivir in Healthy Participants.

Study Summary:
There is an unmet need for safe and efficacious oral therapies for COVID-19 with low potential for drug-drug interactions. Obeldesivir is an orally administered nucleoside prodrug that has shown antiviral potency in nonclinical studies against SARS-CoV-2 and its circulating variants. Obeldesivir is metabolized to the active nucleoside triphosphate (GS-443902), which acts as an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. Here, we report the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics from a first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I study following oral administration of obeldesivir and a phase I, open-label absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study following oral administration of [C]-obeldesivir. Overall, obeldesivir was safe and well tolerated at single and multiple doses between 100 and 1,600&#x2009;mg, with low potential for QT prolongation as assessed by QT-concentration analysis. The exposures to GS-441524 increased dose proportionally in the 100-900-mg dose range. GS-441524 accumulated by 35% after twice-daily and 12% after once-daily dosing for 5&#x2009;days. Dose-proportional increases in the intracellular concentration of GS-443902 were also observed in peripheral blood mononuclar cells. Plasma exposure of GS-441524 was not significantly altered by food intake. Following oral administration of [C]-obeldesivir (500&#x2009;mg; 100&#x2009;&#x3bc;Ci), the mean cumulative [C]-dose recovery was 90.7% with 58.5% in urine and 32.2% in feces. GS-441524 was the predominant plasma component (90% ofC-area under the concentration-time curve) and was primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Collectively, data from these studies support selection of the obeldesivir 350&#x2009;mg twice-daily dosing regimen for further evaluation in phase III studies for COVID-19.
