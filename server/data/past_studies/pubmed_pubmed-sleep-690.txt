Study Title: Can an intervention integrating sports and medicine improve children's health more effectively? Monitoring based on sleep, body mass index, and heart rate variability.

Study Summary:
Theoretical studies have suggested that the integration of sports and medicine with one another could positively affect children's health. By monitoring the variation characteristics of children's sleep, body mass index (BMI), and heart rate variability (HRV), we explored and compared the influences of and differences between two interventions - physical exercise and an intervention integrating sports and medicine - on improving children's health. We conducted a randomised controlled study, where we randomly divided 136 children into the physical exercise group (PEG), the integration of sports and medicine group (ISMG), and the control group. We measured sleep, BMI, and HRV at baseline and week eight. After the eight-week intervention, the sleep scores in the PEG and the ISMG were significantly lower than in the control group, while the scores in the ISMG were significantly lower than in the PEG. After the eight-week intervention, the BMI of both the PEG and the ISMG was significantly lower than that of the control group, without a significand difference between the two intervention groups. After the eight-week intervention, the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square differences of the standard deviation (RMSSD), low-frequency of normal (LFn), and high-frequency of normal (HFn) in the PEG and the ISMG were significantly higher than those in the control group, again without a significant difference between the two intervention groups. After intervention, sleep, BMI, and HRV of the three groups were correlated with one another to different degrees, but the correlation coefficient of the two exercise groups was higher. Based on the interventions, we observed a significant correlation between sleep, BMI, and HRV in children. Regular physical exercise or an intervention integrating sports and medicine could synergistically improve sleep, BMI, and HRV in this population, with the latter having a better effect on improving sleep quality.
