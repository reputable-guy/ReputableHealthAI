Study Title: Mindfulness as a way of reducing automatic constraints on thought.

Study Summary:
The number of mindfulness-based wellness promotion programs offered by institutions, governments, and through mobile apps, has grown exponentially in the last decade. Yet, the scientific understanding of what mindfulness is and how it works is still evolving. Here I focus on two common mindfulness practices: focused attention (FA) and open-monitoring (OM). First, I summarize what is known about FA and OM meditation at the psychological level. While they share similar emotion regulation goals, they differ in terms of some of their attention regulation goals. Second, I turn to the neuroscientific literature, showing that FA meditation is associated with consistent activations of cortical 'control' network regions and deactivations of cortical 'default' network regions. In contrast, OM meditation seems to be most consistently associated with changes in the functional connectivity patterns of subcortical structures, including the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Finally, I present a novel account of the mental changes during FA and OM meditation as understood from within the Dynamic Framework of Thought (DFT) - a conceptual framework that distinguishes between deliberate and automatic constraints on thought. Although deliberate self-regulation processes are often emphasized in scientific and public discourse on mindfulness, here I argue that mindfulness may primarily involve changes in automatic constraints on thought. In particular, I argue that mindfulness reduces the occurrence of automatized sequences of mental states, or habits of thought. In this way, mindfulness may increase the spontaneity of thought and reduce automatically constrained forms of thought such as rumination and obsessive thought.
