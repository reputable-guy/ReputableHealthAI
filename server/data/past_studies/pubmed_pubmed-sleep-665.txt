Study Title: Multi-center safety and efficacy study of a negative-pressure intraoral device in obstructive sleep apnea.

Study Summary:
Intraoral devices, with or without negative oral pressure, can stabilize the oropharynx and reduce obstructive sleep apneas. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with the iNAP&#xae; Sleep Therapy System, which applies negative oral pressure through an intra-oral appliance, would reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea in a multi-center, prospective, first-night-randomized-order cross-over study. 130 patients fulfilled the entry criteria (age <75, AHI 15-55, BMI <33), and 63 entered the primary endpoint cohort (Total Sleep Time &#x2265;4&#xa0;h/night on the baseline polysomnogram and an oral negative vacuum time maintained by iNAP&#xae;&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;4&#xa0;h/night and total sleep time &#x2265;4&#xa0;h/night during the first treatment study). 54 patients completed a second treatment sleep study at least 28 days after the first sleep study. Among the primary endpoint cohort (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;63, age&#xa0;=&#xa0;53.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;11.3, BMI&#xa0;=&#xa0;27.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.8), 33 patients (52&#xa0;%; 95&#xa0;% confidence interval&#xa0;=&#xa0;40%-64&#xa0;%, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) responded to iNAP treatment according to the Sher criteria (>50&#xa0;% reduction in AHI and an AHI &#x2264;20 events/hr). The average oxy-hemoglobin saturation increased by 1-2%, and the average percent oxygen desaturation decreased (was less severe) by 1&#xa0;% while using the iNAP device. The incidence of adverse events, all self-limited, was low. The reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index was durable over the 28-day study. Patients used iNAP on average 5.6&#xa0;h per night during the study period. The iNAP&#xae; Sleep Therapy System achieved a durable benefit in more than half the patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and may be considered in patients who object to or failed continuous positive airway pressure.
