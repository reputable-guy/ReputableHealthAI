Study Title: Wellness Following Wins and Losses Based on Psychological Hardiness in Division I Women's Lacrosse.

Study Summary:
Psychological hardiness encompasses three components: commitment, control, and challenge, and illustrates how individuals respond to stressors. Analyzing athletes' responses to wins and losses, depending on their psychological hardiness level, may provide insight of the impact of game outcome on student-athlete wellness. The purpose of this study was to examine postgame subjective wellness scores based on level of psychological hardiness following wins and losses in collegiate female lacrosse athletes. Players (= 17) took the Dispositional Resilience Scale Scale-15 (DRS-15) at the start of the academic year and were grouped based on hardiness level: above average (AH) and below average (BA). Participants took a daily wellness survey rating their overall wellness, energy level, muscle soreness, stress level, and sleep quality. RM-ANOVA indicated no difference in post-game wellness scores between hardiness groups ((5,11) = 1.073,= .426, ES = .328), by game outcome ((5,11) = 2.361,= .109, ES = .518), or an interaction between hardiness and outcome of game ((5,11) = 1.421,= .291, ES = .392). No hardiness group differences were found for overall wellness or sub-scores. These results show subjective wellness scores decrease collectively after a loss versus a win but refute prior studies as hardy players did not experience significantly less stress than their less hardy counterparts. Future studies should be conducted to assess wellness after differing game outcomes over many seasons to assist coaching staff on the subjective, psychological impacts of game.
