Study Title: Pre-exercise ingestion of a low glycaemic index rice-based mixed meal increases fat oxidation and endurance running performance in a hot-humid environment.

Study Summary:
Relative to exercise in a thermoneutral environment, there is only limited evidence demonstrating that a low glycaemic index (LGI) pre-exercise meal can enhance endurance exercise performance in a hot-humid (HH) condition. Also, previous studies predominantly utilised Western-based and single food items, with minimal focus on Asian-based mixed meals. This study aimed to investigate the impact of pre-exercise LGI and high glycaemic index (HGI) rice-based mixed meals on endurance performance among acclimatised trained athletes in HH condition (32 &#xb0;C, 65% relative humidity). Twelve native-born endurance-trained male runners (age 22.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.8 years; peak oxygen consumption (V&#x307;O) 64.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.5&#xa0;mL kgmin) completed two trials consisting of 45&#x2009;min steady-state (SS) run at 70% V&#x307;Ofollowed by 10&#xa0;km performance run (TT). Three hours before exercise, participants consumed an isocaloric rice-based mixed meals containing either LGI (GI value&#xa0;=&#xa0;47) or HGI (GI value&#xa0;=&#xa0;80), providing 1.3&#xa0;g of carbohydrate (CHO) per kg of body mass. Participants ran faster during TTafter consuming the LGI meal compared to the HGI meal (LGI: 55.18&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.22&#xa0;vs. HGI: 57.03&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.25&#xa0;min,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.010). End rectal temperature did not significantly differ between trials (LGI: 39.16&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.74&#xa0;vs. HGI: 38.95&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.46 &#xb0;C,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.352). Fat oxidation was higher during the SS run in the LGI compared to the HGI trial (LGI: 0.19&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.05&#xa0;vs. HGI: 0.13&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.19&#xa0;g min,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). This study demonstrated that, relative to HGI, consuming a pre-exercise LGI rice-based mixed meal enhanced endurance performance in HH environment among acclimatised trained male athletes.
