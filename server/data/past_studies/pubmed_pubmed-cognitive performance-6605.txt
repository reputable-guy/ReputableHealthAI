Purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of yogic visual concentration (Trataka) on cognitive performance and anxiety among adolescents studying in selected schools at Chennai. Methodology This study was designed to assess cognitive performance and anxiety among students using quantitative approach. True Experimental study design was used for this study. Pretest assessment of cognitive performance and anxiety was done by standardized tools (Stroop color word test, Hamilton anxiety scale) for Experimental and Control groups. Intervention of yogic visual concentration (Trataka) was experimented in one group. Control group were kept on routine activities. Post test assessment of cognitive performance and anxiety by standardized tools was performed on experimental and control groups. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The 0.05 level of significance was used. Results A significant difference in the mean difference of color word score, color score, word score and inference score between the study and control groups at the level of p<0.0001 was observed. Results indicate an association in the cognitive performance (word) with background variables such as, gender, father's occupation in the study group during the post test and no association in the control group. There were no associations between anxiety cognitive performance (color and word) and demographic variables in both groups.
