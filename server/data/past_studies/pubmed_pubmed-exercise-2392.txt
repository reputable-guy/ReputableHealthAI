Study Title: Benefits of a group-based running session on feelings of energy and fatigue: No augmenting effect of green exercise during the defoliation season.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled trial investigated the impact of a brief session of group-based running on feelings of energy and fatigue, comparing exercise in a local nature reserve versus an outdoor built environment, and a sedentary control condition. Sixty-six physically active university students participated, with 56 providing full data for each time point. Consistent with previous research, participants in both exercise groups reported significantly increased energy and decreased fatigue compared to those in the sedentary control group. However, the type of outdoor environment did not significantly influence the magnitude of improvements. Contrary to expectations, there was no significant difference in energy enhancement or fatigue mitigation between participants who jogged in a local nature reserve versus those who jogged on a cinder track in an urbanized area. The study discusses potential reasons for this, including seasonal variations in forest volatile organic compounds (FVOCs) concentrations, which may impact the psychological effects associated with forest environments. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between exercise, environment, and feelings of energy/feelings of fatigue.
