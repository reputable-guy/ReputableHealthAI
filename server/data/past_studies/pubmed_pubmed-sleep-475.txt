Study Title: The role of nutraceuticals in the management of temporomandibular disorders.

Study Summary:
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are usually treated with occlusal appliances and supportive treatments such as physical therapy and drugs. Supplements can be included among potential supportive therapies, with the aim of reducing the use of drugs. To evaluate the efficacy of nutraceuticals' short-term treatment in subjects with temporomandibular disorders. The study started in January 2021 and ended in January 2022. Subjects with temporomandibular disorders and a verbal numeric scale >40 were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the following groups. If waiting to start a therapy, to the nutraceutical group or to the no treatment group, while if already undergoing splint therapy, to nutraceautical+splint group or to splint therapy group. Nutraceutical used was composed by Boswellia Serrata Casperome, Magnesium, Tryptophan and vitamins B2 and D with a posology of one tablet/day before sleep for 40&#xa0;days. Presence of temporomandibular pain, headache, neck pain and sleep/emotional disorders were assessed at T0 and at T1, after 40&#xa0;days. ANOVA was performed to compare treatments with nutraceuticals and their&#xa0;respective controls, as for the variables related to painful symptomatology. Chi-squared was conducted to assess differences in sleep/emotional disorders between groups. The statistical significance was p<0.05. The groups using nutraceuticals showed statistically significant improvements over controls for most of the variables analyzed. The use of nutraceutical seems to be a valuable support for TMD therapy in the short term either alone or combined with occlusal splint therapy.
