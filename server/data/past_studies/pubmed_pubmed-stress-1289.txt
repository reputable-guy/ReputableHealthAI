Study Title: Reducing work-related stress among health professionals by using a training-based intervention programme for leaders in a cluster randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Healthcare organisations worldwide are affected by the shortage of health professionals due to work-related stress and health professional leaders play an important role by implementing effective strategies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether the STRAIN intervention program (using evidence-based training for health professional leaders) can reduce work-related stress among health professionals. This study is based on a cluster randomised controlled trial, consists of three measurements and includes 165 participating hospitals, nursing homes and home care organisations. A total of 206 health professional leaders took part in the intervention programme and 19,340 health professionals participated in the study. Results showed no significant differences (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05) between the intervention and control group regarding the effort-reward imbalance ratio, quantitative demands, opportunities for development, bond with the organisation, quality of leadership, social community, role clarity, rewards, difficulties with demarcation and work-private life conflict. Pre-/post-test analysis revealed a tendency for significant positive results (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) for stressors, stress symptoms and long-term consequences for organisations with a leaders' participation rate of &#x2265;&#x2009;75%. Leaders' awareness, commitment and readiness is essential to implement effective strategies reducing work-related stress.
