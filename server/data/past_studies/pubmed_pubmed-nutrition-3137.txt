Study Title: Engaging Interprofessional Health Students in a Prescription Produce Plan.

Study Summary:
Nursing students participated in an interprofessional student-led prescription produce program (PPP) serving low-income older adults attending a community-based wellness and care coordination program. Students engaged in an online training module covering nutrition education and health promotion, integral components of a PPP. Ninety-five percent of students self-rated themselves as somewhat confident/very confident to participate in the PPP after completing an online learning module. Further investigation is needed on integrating students from diverse health professions to address the multifaceted factors related to nutrition and other social determinants of health affecting the management of chronic diseases.
