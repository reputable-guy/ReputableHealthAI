Study Title: Effect of Continuous Infusion Therapy With Low-dose Terlipressin Combined With Norepinephrine on Hemodynamics, Inflammatory Markers, and Prognosis in Patients With Severe Septic Shock.

Study Summary:
The present study investigated the impact of continuous infusion therapy with low-dose terlipressin (TP) combined with norepinephrine on hemodynamics, inflammatory markers, and prognosis in patients with severe septic shock. Seventy-four patients with severe septic shock were randomly assigned to either a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37) or an observation group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37). Patients in the control group received norepinephrine alone, while those in the observation group received a continuous infusion of low-dose TP in addition to norepinephrine. To assess the effect of treatment, a set of clinical parameters was evaluated in both groups before and after treatment. These parameters included hemodynamic indicators (heart rate [HR], mean arterial pressure [MAP], central venous pressure [CVP], cardiac index [CI], and systemic vascular resistance index [SVRI]), levels of serum inflammatory markers (interleukin-8 [IL-8], tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; [TNF-&#x3b1;], and hypersensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]), renal function indicators (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], serum creatinine [SCr], and cystatin C [Cys-C]), serum procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate, as well as lactate clearance rate (LCR). Additionally, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, 28-day mortality rate, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) incidence rate, and adverse reaction incidence were also determined. Compared to baseline values, MAP, CVP, CI, SVRI, and LCR increased in both groups after treatment, while HR, levels of IL-8, TNF-&#x3b1;, hs-CRP, BUN, SCr, PCT, and lactate all decreased. Additionally, APACHE II scores also decreased. Furthermore, the observation group exhibited higher MAP, CVP, CI, SVRI, and LCR, along with lower HR, levels of IL-8, TNF-&#x3b1;, hs-CRP, BUN, SCr, PCT, and lactate than the control group after treatment. The observation group also had lower APACHE II score, 28-day mortality rate, MODS incidence rate, and adverse reaction incidence than the control group after treatment (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). Continuous infusion therapy with low-dose TP combined with norepinephrine was effective in treating patients with severe septic shock, improving hemodynamic parameters, reducing the levels of inflammatory markers, promoting renal function recovery, and reducing the mortality rate.
