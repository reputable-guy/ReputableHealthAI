Study Title: The feasibility and preliminary effects of a pilot randomized controlled trial: Videoconferencing acceptance and commitment therapy in distressed family caregivers of people with dementia.

Study Summary:
This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined preliminary effects of an 8-week videoconferencing acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) program supplemented with psychoeducation materials on distressed family caregivers of persons living with dementia (PLWD) compared to the control group provided with psychoeducation materials only. Nineteen family caregivers of PLWD in the USA were randomly assigned to the ACT group or the control group. Data was collected at pretest, posttest, and 1-month follow-up (F/U). Compared to the control group, the ACT group showed a significantly larger reduction in grief at posttest, with a medium effect size. Small effects of ACT were found in anxiety, psychological quality of life, and engagement in meaningful activities at posttest and grief, engagement in meaningful activities, and psychological flexibility at F/U compared to the control group. These promising findings warrant a full-scale RCT with adequate power to measure the efficacy of videoconferencing ACT for caregivers of PLWD.
