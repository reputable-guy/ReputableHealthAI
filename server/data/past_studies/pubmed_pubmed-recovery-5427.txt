Study Title: The significance of different intervertebral spaces in combined spinal epidural anesthesia in cesarean section.

Study Summary:
The number of cesarean sections performed is increasing every year, and obstetric anesthesia is of great interest to physicians and research scholars because of its specificity, high risk, and high complication rate. To investigate the effects of combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) with different intervertebral spaces during cesarean section on anesthesia effect, anesthesia onset time, anesthesia recovery time, maternal adverse reactions, and neonates. Ninety-two women who underwent cesarean section in our hospital from September 2022 to February 2023 were selected as the study subjects and randomly divided them into two groups (group A and group B), 46 women in each group. Group A underwent CSEA via an L2-3 gap and group B underwent CSEA via an L3-4 gap puncture. The anesthesia effect, anesthesia onset time, sensory recovery time, adverse effects, and neonatal Apgar score were compared between the two groups. When CSEA was performed from L2-3, the anesthesia efficiency was higher, but the difference was not statistically significant. When anesthesia was performed by puncture from L2-3, the onset of anesthesia and recovery time was shorter, and the incidence of intraoperative maternal nausea and vomiting, hypotension, respiratory depression, and other adverse reactions was low with a statistically significant difference. However, the Apgar scores of the neonates in the two groups have no difference. When CSEA is induced via L2-3 interspace, anesthesia has a rapid onset of action, shorter recovery time, and few maternal adverse effects, without affecting the final anesthetic outcome.
