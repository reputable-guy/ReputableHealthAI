Study Title: Antenatal mobile-delivered mindfulness-based intervention to reduce perinatal depression risk and improve obstetric and neonatal outcomes: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
One in five mothers will experience perinatal depression (PND) during pregnancy and within their first year following childbirth. Current evidence suggests the short-term efficacy of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) for perinatal women, but the extent to which this positive impact remains the early postpartum period is unclear. This study investigated the short- and maintenance efficacy of a mobile-delivered four-immeasurable MBI on PND, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Seventy-five adult pregnant women suffering from heightened distress were randomized to receive a mobile-delivered four-immeasurable MBI (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38) or a web-based perinatal education program (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;37). PND was measured by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at baseline, post-intervention, 37th-week gestation, and 4-6&#xa0;weeks postpartum. Outcomes also included obstetric and neonatal outcomes, trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and positive affect. Participants reported an average age of 30.6 (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.1) years with a mean gestational age of 18.8 (SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.6) weeks. In intention-to-treat analyses, women in the mindfulness group showed a significantly greater reduction in depression from baseline to post-intervention (adjusted mean change difference [&#x3b2;]&#xa0;=&#xa0;-3.9; 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;[-6.05, -1.81]; d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.6), and the reduction sustained until 4-6&#xa0;weeks postpartum (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-6.3; 95%CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;[-8.43, -4.12]; d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.0), compared with control. They had a significantly reduced risk of emergent cesarean section (relative risk&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.5) and gave birth to infants with higher Apgar scores (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.6;p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.03; d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.7). Depression reduction before giving birth significantly mediated the intervention effect on lowering the emergency cesarean risk. With a reasonably low dropout rate (13.2&#xa0;%), the mobile-delivered MBI can be an acceptable and effective intervention for reducing depression throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Our study also suggests the potential benefits of early prevention for mitigating emergent cesarean section risk and enhancing neonatal health.
