Study Title: Feasibility of co-transplantation of umbilical cord blood and third-party mesenchymal stromal cells after (non)myeloablative conditioning in patients with hematological malignancies.

Study Summary:
Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of stem cells for patients lacking a 9/10 or 10/10 HLA identical donor. However, after UCB transplantation, time to engraftment and immune recovery are prolonged, increasing the risk of fatal complications. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can support hematopoietic engraftment and have immunosuppressive effects. The primary objective of this phase I/II multicenter study was to determine the feasibility and safety of UCB transplantation with co-infusion of third party MSC, as assessed by treatment related mortality (TRM) at day 100. Secondary objectives were engraftment, immune recovery, occurrence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), infections, disease free survival, relapse incidence and overall survival. Eleven patients were grafted according to this protocol. Allogeneic transplantation after co-infusion appears feasible with 18 % TRM at day 100. Engraftment data show a median time of 16 days to neutrophil and 27 days to platelet recovery, which is shorter than what is usually reported after UCB transplantation. Only 1 episode of acute GVHD was reported. In conclusion, MSC and UCB co-transplantation is feasible and might help overcome some of the drawbacks of UCB transplantation.
