Study Title: Improving adolescents' dietary behavior through teacher-delivered cancer prevention education: a school-based cluster randomized intervention trial in urban Rajasthan.

Study Summary:
Dietary practices are one of the most common modifiable risk factors for cancers. Foods rich in dietary fibers are considered protective, meanwhile fast & junk foods are risk for common cancers. Adolescence period is marked by habit formation and is thus suited for delivering behavioral intervention. Schools offer an optimal setting for planning and executing these interventions to a large number of adolescents. To assess the effectiveness of a teacher-delivered cancer-prevention education in changing dietary behaviors of school going adolescents. A cluster randomized trial was conducted in government secondary and senior secondary schools with schools as clusters. A minimum required sample of 1032 students was estimated from 16 schools with 1:1 allocation in intervention and non-intervention groups. Dietary behaviors were recorded as dichotomous variable. The determinants were recorded as per theory of planned behavior framework using Likert-scale. Two teachers from each intervention school were trained to deliver cancer prevention education with focus on role of dietary behavior. Pre-post training assessment of teachers' knowledge towards common cancers was done using a self-administered questionnaire. Gender adjusted difference-in-difference analysis was done to assess intervention effect on both healthy and unhealthy behaviors. In selected schools all students from classes 8 to 10 were approached and a total of 1224 students were enrolled, of whom 1096 completed the study. The study recorded significant improvement in scores of students from intervention group compared to non-intervention group for their attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention towards consuming healthy and avoiding unhealthy foods. The intervention was effective in significantly improving the proportion of students limiting fried/fast/packed food & sugar sweetened beverages (OR:1.51, 95%CI:1.08,2.12,p:0.017), and consuming fruits & vegetables daily (OR:1.55, 95%CI:1.08,2.22, p:0.017) while adjusting effect of gender. Classroom-based cancer prevention education delivered through teachers during regular working hours is effective in improving dietary behaviors and its determinants among adolescent students. Thus, we recommend integrating a section focusing on the role of diet in cancer prevention and other lifestyle diseases in the existing school curriculum. The trial was registered under Clinical Trial Registry-India with registration number CTRI/2018/12/016586, dated-10/12/2018.
