Study Title: Outcomes of Zone II Flexor Tendon Repair Under General Versus Wide Awake Local Anesthesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Wide awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) is gaining popularity with flexor tendon repair. We hypothesized that results of zone II flexor tendon repair performed under WALANT would be superior to those performed under general anesthesia (GA). A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare results of repair of zone II flexor tendon lacerations under WALANT versus GA. Following sample size estimation, 86 digits were included and randomized into two groups. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using a six-stranded core stitch and running epitenon suture. All patients followed the same early active rehabilitation protocol. The primary outcome was recovery calculated using the Strickland and Glogovac criteria. Secondary outcomes included rupture rate, complication rate, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score. All outcomes were reported at the 6-month visit for all patients. Of the 86 digits, three were lost to follow-up. Analysis was performed on 43 digits in the WALANT group and 40 in the GA group. Demographic characteristics including age and sex were comparable in both groups. Rupture of the repair occurred in two digits in each of the WALANT and GA groups. An excellent or good outcome was achieved in 49% and 56% of the digits in the WALANT and GA groups, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. DASH scores averaged 12.9 and 8.4 for the WALANT and GA groups, respectively. WALANT may not be superior to GA in regards function, rates of rupture, and patient-reported outcomes in repair of zone II flexor tendon lacerations. Surgeons can be confident in choosing either technique if rigorous patient selection, sound surgical technique, and proper hand therapy are employed. Therapeutic I.
