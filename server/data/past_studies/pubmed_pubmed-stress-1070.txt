Study Title: "Family Connections", a program for relatives of people with borderline personality disorder: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Family members of people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) often experience high levels of psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or burden. Family Connections (FC) is a pioneer program designed for relatives of people with BPD, and it is the most empirically supported treatment thus far. The aim of this study was to carry out a randomized clinical trial to confirm the differential efficacy of FC versus an active treatment as usual (TAU) in relatives of people with BPD in a Spanish population sample. The sample consisted of 121 family members (82 family units) and a total of 82 patients who participated in a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT). The primary outcome was burden of illness. Secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, stress, family empowerment, and quality of life. This is the first study to evaluate relatives and patients in an RCT design comparing two active treatment conditions of similar durations. Although no statistically significant differences were found between conditions. However, the adjusted posttest means for FC were systematically better than for TAU, and the effect sizes were larger in burden, stress, depression, family functioning, and quality of life in the FC intervention. Patients of caregivers who received the FC condition showed statistically significant improvements in stress, depression, and anxiety. Results indicated that FC helped both patients and relatives pointing to the importance of involving families of patients with severe psychological disorders.
