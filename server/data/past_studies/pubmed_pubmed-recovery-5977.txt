Study Title: Short-Term Dorsal Genital Nerve Stimulation Increases Subjective Arousal in Women With and Without Spinal Cord Injury: A Preliminary Investigation.

Study Summary:
Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects an estimated 40% of women. Unfortunately, FSD is understudied, leading to limited treatment options for FSD. Neuromodulation has shown some success in alleviating FSD symptoms. We developed a pilot study to investigate the short-term effect of electrical stimulation of the dorsal genital nerve and tibial nerve on sexual arousal in healthy women, women with FSD, and women with spinal cord injury (SCI) and FSD. This study comprises a randomized crossover design in three groups: women with SCI, women with non-neurogenic FSD, and women without FSD or SCI. The primary outcome measure was change in vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) from baseline. Secondary outcome measures were changes in subjective arousal, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure from baseline. Participants attended one or two study sessions where they received either transcutaneous dorsal genital nerve stimulation (DGNS) or tibial nerve stimulation (TNS). At each session, a vaginal photoplethysmography sensor was used to measure VPA. Participants also rated their level of subjective arousal and were asked to report any pelvic sensations. We found that subjective arousal increased significantly from before to after stimulation in DGNS study sessions across all women. TNS had no effect on subjective arousal. There were significant differences in VPA between baseline and stimulation, baseline and recovery, and stimulation and recovery periods among participants, but there were no trends across groups or stimulation type. Two participants with complete SCIs experienced genital sensations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure sexual arousal in response to short-term neuromodulation in women. This study indicates that short-term DGNS but not TNS can increase subjective arousal, but the effect of stimulation on genital arousal is inconclusive. This study provides further support for DGNS as a treatment for FSD.
