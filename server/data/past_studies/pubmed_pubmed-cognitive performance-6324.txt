Study Title: Cognitive, Sleep, and Autonomic Responses to Induction of a Ketogenic Diet in Military Personnel: A Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
This pilot study examined the effect of a 2-wk ketogenic diet (KD) compared with a carbohydrate (CHO) diet in military personnel on cognitive performance, mood, sleep, and heart rate variability (HRV).A randomized-controlled, cross-over trial was conducted with eight male military personnel (age, 36 &#xb1; 7 yr; body mass, 83.7 &#xb1; 9.2 kg; BMI, 26.0 &#xb1; 2.3 kg &#xb7; m). Subjects ingested their habitual diet for 7 d (baseline), then an iso-energetic KD (&#x223c;25 g CHO/d) or CHO diet (&#x223c;285 g CHO/d) for 14 d (adaptation), separated by a 12-d washout. HRV, fasting capillary blood D-&#x3b2;HB, and glucose concentration, mood, and sleep were measured daily. Cognitive performance was measured on the 7day of baseline and the 7and 14days of adaptation. Data were analyzed using a series of linear mixed models.Mean weekly D-&#x3b2;HB was higher (95% CI, +0.34 to +2.38 mmol &#xb7; L) and glucose was lower (-0.45 to -0.21 mmol &#xb7; L) in the KD compared with the CHO diet. Cognitive performance (Psychomotor Vigilance Task, 2-choice reaction time, and running memory continuous performance test) and mean weekly fatigue, vigor, and sleep (sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep onset latency) were similar between diets. A diet &#xd7; week interaction for HRV approached significance, with exploratory analyses suggesting HRV was lower compared with baseline during week-2 adapt (-27 to +4 ms) in the KD.A 2-wk KD induction in military personnel does not appear to affect cognitive performance, mood, or sleep, but may lower HRV, indicating increased physiological stress.
