Study Title: Enhancements to a Telewellness Program for People With Physical Disabilities: Mindfulness, Exercise, and Nutrition To Optimize Resilience (MENTOR 2.0).

Study Summary:
This study evaluated the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (NCHPAD) Mindfulness, Exercise, and Nutrition To Optimize Resilience (MENTOR) program for people with physical disabilities. This retrospective evaluation of MENTOR 2.0, an 8-week online group health promotion program, was based on improvements from its first implementation (MENTOR 1.0). Baseline and postassessments included the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), NCHPAD Wellness Assessment (NWA), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale. Estimates and corresponding 95% CIs from linear mixed models were provided to compare baseline and postassessment scores and effect sizes using Cohen d. Among 116 participants (mean age, 53 y; 63% female), postassessment scores increased significantly in the overall NWA and in all 15 NWA domains (effect size, 0.30-0.69). The overall NWA score was 7.59 (95% CI, 5.63-9.56) units higher at postassessment compared with baseline. Scores for GLTEQ health contribution increased significantly among participants with low baseline scores (31.37 [95% CI, 12.97-49.77]) (effect size, 0.50). Mindfulness and resilience scores both showed improvement (0.16 [95% CI, 0.01-0.31]; effect size, 0.15) and (0.72 [95% CI, -0.25 to 1.68]; effect size 0.09), respectively, but only the change in mindfulness was significant. MENTOR 2.0 advanced the evaluation of this online telewellness program for people with physical disabilities by demonstrating consistent results with MENTOR 1.0. We reported improvements in GLTEQ, especially among those with lower baseline scores; in multiple areas of wellness, including physical, mental, and emotional/spiritual health; and in mindfulness and resilience, although the improvements in these 2 constructs were small.
