Study Title: [Influence of Postoperative Diet Type and Regimen on Hospital Comfort&#x2029;and Rehabilitation of Lung Cancer Patients].

Study Summary:
A reasonable and standardized dietary plan and procedure can help patients recovering quickly from lung cancer surgery. The aim of this study is to optimize the diet plan and procedure mainly based on medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet and explore its clinical advantages for postoperative lung cancer patients. From October 2023 to December 2023, a total of 156 patients were collected, who underwent lung cancer surgery in Lung Cancer Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The patients were randomized into MCT group (76 cases) and routine diet (RD) group (80 cases). Clinical symptoms, biochemical index, postoperative hospitalization time and cost, dietary satisfaction and hospitalization comfort between the two groups were analyzed. The mean anus exhausting time in MCT group [24.00 (9.75, 36.97) h] was significantly shorter than that in RD group [28.50 (24.00, 48.00) h] (P<0.001). And the incidence of dizziness (18.42%), nausea and vomiting (6.58%) in MCT group were remarkably lower than those in RD group (51.25%, 31.25%) (P<0.001). Hospitalization comfort score in MCT group [(16.74&#xb1;1.70)] was significantly higher than that in RD group [(14.83&#xb1;2.34)] (P=0.016). Meanwhile, the average hospitalization cost in MCT group [(39,701.82&#xb1;8105.47)&#xa5;] showed an obvious decrease compared with RD group [(44,511.79&#xb1;9593.19)&#xa5;] (P=0.007). Optimizing the dietary plan and procedure mainly based on MCT diet for postoperative lung cancer patients can help the recovery of gastrointestinal function and improve hospitalization comfort, which promoted overall postoperative rehabilitation of patients with lung cancer surgery.
