Study Title: A Phase I Study To Determine the Absolute Bioavailability and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion of Capivasertib in Healthy Male Participants.

Study Summary:
An open-label, single-center, phase I study was conducted to determine the absolute bioavailability and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of capivasertib-a potent, selective AKT serine/threonine kinase inhibitor-in healthy males. In part 1, six participants received a single oral dose of capivasertib (400 mg; tablets) followed by a [C]-radiolabeled intravenous microdose of capivasertib (100g). After a 14-day washout, five of the participants proceeded to part 2 and received a single oral dose of [C]capivasertib (400 mg; solution). In part 1, median time of maximum observed concentration for capivasertib was 1.7 hours, geometric mean terminal elimination half-life was 12.9 hours, and absolute bioavailability was estimated at 28.6% (90% confidence interval, 23.9 to 34.2). In part 2, a high proportion of the administered radioactivity was recovered over the 168-hour sampling period [mean recovery: 95.1% (feces, 50.4%; urine, 44.7%)]. Unchanged capivasertib in urine accounted for 7.4% of the total dose and 21.1% of the systemically available drug. Geometric mean renal clearance was 8.3 L/h, suggesting active tubular secretion. Twelve metabolites were identified in plasma. M11 (AZ14102143)-the glucuronide conjugate of capivasertib, inactive as an AKT serine/threonine kinase inhibitor-was the most abundant, accounting for a mean 78.4% of the plasma drug-related area under the curve. Of 22 metabolites identified in excreta, M11 was the most abundant (mean 28.2% of administered dose), indicating direct glucuronidation as one of the major routes of metabolism. No new safety concerns were identified. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study provides characterization of the pharmacokinetics of capivasertib-a potent, selective AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) inhibitor-including absolute bioavailability, mass balance, and metabolic fate in humans; the findings are being used to inform further clinical development. Absolute bioavailability was estimated at 28.6%, and mean recovery of the administered dose in excreta over 168 hours was 95.1%. M11 (AZ14102143)-the glucuronide conjugate, inactive as an AKT inhibitor-was the most abundant identified metabolite in plasma and excreta.
