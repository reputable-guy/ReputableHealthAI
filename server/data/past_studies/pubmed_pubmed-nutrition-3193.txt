Study Title: Project DINE: Addressing Disparities in Nutrition and Maternal Mortality and Morbidity through Nutrition and Father Engagement.

Study Summary:
This study assessed the outcomes of an intervention (Project DINE) that added nutrition and breastfeeding education to Healthy Start programs in Georgia for a sample of Black expecting parents. Using a community-based participatory approach and a 2 &#xd7; 2 randomized cluster factorial design, three of six Healthy Start sites were intervention sites. Participants completed the Adult Food and Physical Activity Behavior Questionnaire and a breastfeeding education survey pre- and post-intervention. Paired t-tests determined that there was an improvement in overall self-reported diet quality among the expecting couples (n=61; p = .025). Breastfeeding survey data showed that the percentage of correct answers increased from 78% to 84% (n=89; p=.0009) for all participants. Qualitative data were also collected through open-ended responses on the breastfeeding post-test (n=66) and focus groups with fathers (n=10). This project demonstrates the need for nutrition and breastfeeding education for both expecting parents during pregnancy to improve maternal health.
