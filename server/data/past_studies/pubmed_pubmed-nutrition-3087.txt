Study Title: Hungry for nutrition information: Undergraduate students' engagement with nutrition social media nutrition content.

Study Summary:
Social media is a fast-changing, normalized way through which youth access health and nutrition information. Yet, social media content that lacks expertise or altruistic motives can negatively impact this vulnerable population through mis- or disinformation.The aims of this study were to 1) assess how adolescents and young adults engage with nutrition information across social media platforms and account types, and 2) describe their preferences for nutrition social media content.We conducted an exploratory mixed methods study with 57 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory public health nutrition course. First, we calculated descriptive statistics on close-ended survey data on social media use and sociodemographic variables. Then, we performed thematic analysis on open-ended survey data regarding social media use, preferences, and experiences.The median age of participants was 20 years old; 70% of participants identified as female and 11% identified as male. We found that TikTok and Instagram were highly preferred by participants for weight loss, wellness, diet promotion, and sports and fitness topics. In general, participants reported wanting personalized content that conveys positive nutrition messages that are supported by credible expertise.These findings suggest that the nutrition community can engage adolescents and young adults by presenting information as image- and video-based content on social media. Social media content related to weight loss, wellness, diet promotion, and sports and fitness topics should establish credibility using visible markers and embrace body positive messaging for maximum uptake.
