Study Title: Household animal ownership is associated with infant animal source food consumption in Bangladesh.

Study Summary:
Context-specific research is needed on the relationship between household animal production and nutrition outcomes to inform programmes intervening in small-scale animal production. We examined associations between household animal/fishpond ownership and animal source food (ASF) consumption among 6- to 12-month-old infants enroled in the control arm of a cluster-randomised controlled trial in rural Bangladesh. We measured ASF consumption using a 7-day food frequency questionnaire at 6, 9&#xa0;and 12 months&#xa0;and assessed household animal/fishpond ownership at 12 months. We developed negative binomial regression models with random intercepts for infant and cluster, controlling for infant age and sex, maternal age, socioeconomic status&#xa0;and season. Models were stratified by a dichotomised maternal decision-making score. Compared with infants in households without each animal type, those with&#xa0;4-10 and &#x2265;11 poultry consumed eggs 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1, 1.6) and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.0) times more, respectively; 2-3 and &#x2265;4 dairy-producing animals consumed dairy 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.7) and 2.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.1) times more, respectively; and &#x2265;12 meat-producing animals consumed meat 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.8) times more. It was unclear whether there was an association between fishpond ownership and fish consumption. Our results did not suggest that maternal decision-making power was a modifier in the relationship between animal/fishpond ownership and ASF consumption. In this South Asian context, strategies intervening in household animal production may increase infant consumption of eggs, dairy&#xa0;and meat, but not necessarily fish. Research is needed on the role of market access and other dimensions of women's empowerment.
