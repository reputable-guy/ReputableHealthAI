Study Title: Long-term effects of flexible visitation in the intensive care unit on family members' mental health: 12-month results from a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of flexible intensive care unit (ICU) visitation on the 1-year prevalence of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms among family members of critically ill patients. This is a long-term outcome analysis of a cluster-crossover randomized clinical trial that evaluated a flexible visitation model in the ICU (12&#xa0;h/day) compared to a restrictive visitation model (median 1.5&#xa0;h/day) in 36 Brazilian ICUs. In this analysis, family members were assessed 12&#xa0;months after patient discharge from the ICU for the following outcomes: post-traumatic stress symptoms measured by the Impact Event Scale-6 and anxiety and depression symptoms measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A total of 519 family members were analyzed (288 in the flexible visitation group and 231 in the restrictive visitation group). Three-hundred sixty-nine (71.1%) were women, and the mean age was 46.6&#xa0;years. Compared to family members in the restrictive visitation group, family members in the flexible visitation group had a significantly lower prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (21% vs. 30.5%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.98; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). The prevalence of anxiety (28.9% vs. 33.2%; aPR 0.93; 95% CI 0.72-1.21; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59) and depression symptoms (19.2% vs. 25%; aPR, 0.78; 95% CI 0.60-1.02; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07) did not differ significantly between the groups. Flexible ICU visitation, compared to the restrictive visitation, was associated with a significant reduction in the 1-year prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms in family members.
