Study Title: The effect of lavender and rosemary aromatherapy application on cognitive functions, anxiety, and sleep quality in the elderly with diabetes.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to determine the effects of aromatherapy use on cognitive function, anxiety, and sleep quality in the elderly with diabetes. The study was conducted with 63 participants aged 65 and over. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: lavender, rosemary and control groups. The intervention continued for four weeks. Data was collected using the Blessed Orientation Concentration Test, State-Trait Anxiety Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale. Data were analyzed using One-Way ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U/Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon and Friedman tests. In both intervention groups, the 4th week scores of cognitive functions, anxiety, and sleep quality after aromatherapy were significant compared to the baseline scores. In the control group, state anxiety scores were significantly higher in the 2nd and 4th weeks compared to the initial scores. Inhaling lavender and rosemary has been observed to improve cognitive function and sleep quality and reduce anxiety levels. The effects of the essential oils used in the research were evaluated over four weeks. It is thought that studying for a longer period and with more samples would be beneficial. There is a need for studies examining its effects, especially in the elderly with diabetes.
