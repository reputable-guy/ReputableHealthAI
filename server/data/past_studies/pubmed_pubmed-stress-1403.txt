Study Title: Efficacy of ozonated autohemotherapy for improvement of myocardial injury following traumatic brain injury.

Study Summary:
Traumatic brain injury is a kind of injury caused by external violence on the head. Its danger is not limited to life rescue in the early stage of the disease. Moreover, the subsequent inflammatory reaction and the change in its oxidative stress level will cause secondary myocardial injury. The purpose of this study is to explore the myocardial protective effect of ozone autohemotherapy (OA) in the progression of acute traumatic brain injury (TBI). Forty patients with acute TBI were recruited and divided into The treatment group (Group OA, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) and the Control group (Group C, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19). Patients in Group OA received OA before surgery and on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days, while patients in Group C underwent autologous blood transfusion. Venous blood was collected from all patients before (T0) and after 7&#xa0;days (T1) days of surgery for measurement of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). At T0 and T1, transthoracic cardiac ultrasound was performed to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and venous blood was sampled to determine the contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were calculated, and other clinical indexes were recorded. (1) The levels of cTnT at T1 were significantly higher as compared with that at T0 in both groups (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Compared with Group C, a remarkable decline in the content of NT-proBNP was found in Group OA at T1 (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021). (2) The LVEF (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and serum SOD (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015) at T1 were significantly increased in Group OA as compared with those in Group C. (3) The length of Intensive Care Unit and hospitalization time for patients in Group OA was distinctly shorter than that for patients in Group C (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015, respectively). Perioperative OA treatment can alleviate the secondary myocardial injury during the disease course of TBI, which might be associated with its myocardial protective effect against oxidative stress. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Changzhou NO.2 People's Hospital. The protocol was registered prospectively with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029612) on February 02, 2020.
