Study Title: Web-Based Therapist-Guided Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Body Dysmorphic Disorder: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and stand-alone mindfulness meditation interventions are gaining empirical support for a wide variety of mental health conditions. In this study, we test the efficacy of web-based therapist-guided mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-M) for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a psychiatric disorder characterized by preoccupations with perceived defects in appearance. This study aims to determine whether CBT-M for BDD delivered on the web is feasible and acceptable and whether mindfulness meditation adds to CBT treatment effects for BDD. In this 8-week, 2-arm, parallel pilot randomized controlled trial, n=28 adults (aged between 18 and 55 years) were randomly allocated to an experimental group (web-based therapist-guided CBT-M) or a control group (web-based therapist-guided CBT). Study retention, accrual, and intervention adherence were assessed, along with self-report measures for BDD, depression, anxiety, and pain intensity taken at baseline and postintervention. This study was feasible to implement and deemed acceptable by participants. After 8 weeks, significant improvements were found on all outcome measures for both treatment groups, and large between-group effect sizes favoring CBT-M were found for BDD symptom severity (d=-0.96), depression (d=-1.06), pain severity (d=-1.12), and pain interference (d=-1.28). However, linear mixed models demonstrated no significant differences between the groups over 8 weeks. The results suggest that mindfulness meditation may add to beneficial web-based CBT treatment effects for BDD. An adequately powered randomized control trial of web-based CBT-M is warranted.
