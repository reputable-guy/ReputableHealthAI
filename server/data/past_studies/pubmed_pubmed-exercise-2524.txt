Study Title: The effect of different tensions/directions of I-shaped taping in combination with corrective exercise on postural kyphosis in adolescents.

Study Summary:
Choosing appropriate complementary methods, such as exercise, along with taping methods may be effective in treating patients with kyphosis. The present study aimed to examine the effect of different tape tensions/directions combined with corrective exercises on the degree of postural kyphosis in adolescents. In this randomized controlled trial, 54 adolescents with postural kyphosis were assigned into three groups: No taping (control), I-shaped taping technique with 10% stretching force (Kinesiotape I), and I-shaped taping using facilitation technique with 40% stretching force (Kinesiotape II). Both groups in Kinesiotaping also received a V-shaped tape (10% stretching force). All participants received a similar comprehensive corrective exercise. Patients received the allocated interventions for 6 weeks and visited every two weeks at the clinic. Measurements were done using a flexible ruler, kyphometer, and photogrammetry. Between-group analyses revealed no significant differences between the study groups following the interventions (p> 0.05). However, the within-group analyses according to flexible ruler, Kyphometer, and Photogrammetry measurements indicated that exercise alone (control) [p= 0.011, p= 0.056, and p= 0.005, respectively], Kinesiotape I - exercise [p= 0.001, p= 0.002, p= 0.013, and respectively], as well as Kinesiotape II - exercise [p< 0.001, p< 0.001, and p< 0.001, respectively] significantly decreased the postural kyphosis degree except exercise alone using Kyphometer measurement. No adverse events were observed during the study. The findings of photogrammetry, flexible rulers, and photogrammetry similarly indicated that the corrective exercises with or without tape tension/directions significantly decreased the postural kyphosis degree in adolescents.
