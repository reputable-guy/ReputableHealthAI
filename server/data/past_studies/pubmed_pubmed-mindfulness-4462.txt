Study Title: Remembering to Resume: A Randomized Trial Comparing Combined Interruption Management Training and Simulation-Based Education to Simulation-Based Education Alone.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to determine if purposeful presimulation interruption management training impacts cognitive load and successful completion of simulation objectives more than the experience alone. Practicing nurses are frequently interrupted, increasing the risk for error and task time. Novices are particularly vulnerable to interruption consequences. A between-subjects design and block randomization of prelicensure baccalaureate nursing students ( n = 146) was used to compare group differences in cognitive load, use of interruption management strategies, and completion of simulation required elements. Potential relationships between outcomes and age, mindfulness, and experience were explored. An analysis of covariance demonstrated significantly lower perceived mental demand for those receiving training. Older learners and those receiving training implemented more interruption management strategies. Combining simulation-based education (SBE) with purposeful training enhances interruption management more than SBE alone. Frequent interruption training and SBE are recommended to enhance risk awareness.
