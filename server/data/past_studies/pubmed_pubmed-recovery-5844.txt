Study Title: A Randomized Clinical Trial of Direct Anterior Versus Mini-Posterior Total Hip Arthroplasty: Small, Early Functional Differences Did Not Lead to Meaningful Clinical Differences at 7.5 Years.

Study Summary:
Our previously reported randomized clinical trial of direct anterior approach (DAA) versus mini-posterior approach (MPA) total hip arthroplasty showed slightly faster initial recovery for patients who had a DAA and no differences in complications or clinical or radiographic outcomes beyond 8 weeks. The aims of the current study were to determine if early advantages of DAA led to meaningful clinical differences beyond 5 years and to identify differences in midterm complications. Of the 101 original patients, 93 were eligible for follow-up at a mean of 7.5 years (range, 2.1 to 10). Clinical outcomes were compared with Harris Hip, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (HOOS) scores and subscores, complications, reoperations, and revisions. Harris Hip scores were similar (95.3 &#xb1; 6.0 versus 93.5 &#xb1; 10.3 for DAA and MPA, respectively, P&#xa0;= .79). The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental scores were similar (46.2 &#xb1; 9.3 versus 46.2 &#xb1; 10.6, P&#xa0;= .79, and 52.3 &#xb1; 7.1 versus 55.2 &#xb1; 4.5, P&#xa0;= .07 in the DAA and MPA groups, respectively). The HOOS scores were similar (97.4 &#xb1; 7.9 versus 96.3 &#xb1; 6.7 for DAA and MPA, respectively, P&#xa0;= .07). The HOOS quality of life subscores were 96.9 &#xb1; 10.8 versus 92.3 &#xb1; 16.0 for DAA and MPA, respectively (P&#xa0;= .046). No clinical outcome met the minimally clinically important difference. There were 4 surgical complications in the DAA group (1 femoral loosening requiring revision, 1 dislocation treated closed, and 2 wound dehiscences requiring debridement), and 6 surgical complications in the MPA group (3 dislocations, 2 treated closed, and 1 revised to dual mobility; 2 intraoperative fractures treated with a cable; and 1 wound dehiscence treated nonoperatively). At a mean of 7.5 years, this randomized clinical trial demonstrated no clinically meaningful differences in outcomes, complications, reoperations, or revisions between DAA and MPA total hip arthroplasty.
