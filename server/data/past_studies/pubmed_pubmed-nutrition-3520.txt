Study Title: Effects of Nutritional Support Combined with Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation on Muscle Strength and Thickness: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Healthy Young Adult Males.

Study Summary:
In the management of post-injury patients with activity limitations, methods to prevent musculoskeletal disorders and hasten recovery are important. This randomized controlled, single-blinded study was a preliminary investigation of the combined effect of nutritional support with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on muscle strength and thickness. Healthy young adult males (median age, 21 years) were enrolled; each of their hands was randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: Placebo, Nutrition, NMES, and Nutrition + NMES. All participants received whey protein or placebo (3x/week for 6 weeks) and NMES training (3x/week for 6 weeks) on the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle of either the left or right hand. ADM muscle strength and thickness were analyzed at baseline and at week 7. We analyzed 38 hands (9 Placebo, 10 Nutrition, 9 NMES, 10 Nutrition + NMES). There was significantly greater muscle strengthening in the Nutrition + NMES group compared to the Placebo group or the NMES group, but no significant difference in gain of muscle thickness. The combined intervention may be effective in improving muscle strength. Future clinical trials targeting various muscles after sports-related injuries are warranted.
