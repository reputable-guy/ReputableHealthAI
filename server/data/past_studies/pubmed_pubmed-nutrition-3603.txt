Study Title: Feasibility and impact of ketogenic dietary interventions in polycystic kidney disease: KETO-ADPKD-a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Ketogenic dietary interventions (KDIs) are beneficial in animal models of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). KETO-ADPKD, an exploratory, randomized, controlled trial, is intended to provide clinical translation of these findings (NCT04680780). Sixty-six patients were randomized to a KDI arm (ketogenic diet [KD] or water fasting [WF]) or the control group. Both interventions induce significant ketogenesis on the basis of blood and breath acetone measurements. Ninety-five percent (KD) and 85% (WF) report the diet as feasible. KD leads to significant reductions in body fat and liver volume. Additionally, KD is associated with reduced kidney volume (not reaching statistical significance). Interestingly, the KD group exhibits improved kidney function at the end of treatment, while the control and WF groups show a progressive decline, as is typical in ADPKD. Safety-relevant events are largely mild, expected (initial flu-like symptoms associated with KD), and transient. Safety assessment is complemented by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lipid profile analyses.
