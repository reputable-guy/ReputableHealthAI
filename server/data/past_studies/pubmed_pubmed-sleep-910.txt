Study Title: The John N. Insall Award: Does Melatonin Improve Subjective Sleep Quality After Total Knee Arthroplasty? A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbance is a common problem following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The objective of this study was to determine if exogenous melatonin improves sleep quality following primary TKA. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. A total of 172 patients undergoing unilateral TKA for primary knee osteoarthritis were randomized to receive either 5 mg melatonin (n&#xa0;= 86) or 125 mg vitamin C placebo (n&#xa0;= 86) nightly for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 6 weeks and 90 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included 6-week and 90-day patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), morphine milligram equivalents prescribed, medication compliance, adverse events, and 90-day readmissions. Mean PSQI scores worsened at 6 weeks before returning to the preoperative baseline at 90 days in both groups. There were no differences in PSQI scores between melatonin and placebo groups at 6 weeks (10.2 &#xb1; 4.2 versus 10.5 &#xb1; 4.4, P&#xa0;= .66) or 90 days (8.1 &#xb1; 4.1 versus 7.5 &#xb1; 4.0, P&#xa0;= .43). Melatonin did not improve the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, Lower Extremity Activity Scale, Visual Analog Scale for pain, or Veterans Rand 12 Physical Component Score or Mental Component Score at 6 weeks or 90 days. Poor sleep quality was associated with worse PROMs at 6 weeks and 90 days on univariate and multivariable analyses, but melatonin did not modify these associations. There were no differences in morphine milligram equivalents prescribed, medication compliances, adverse events, or 90-day readmissions between both groups. Exogenous melatonin did not improve subjective sleep quality or PROMs at 6 weeks or 90 days following TKA. Poor sleep quality was associated with worse patient-reported function and pain. Our results do not support the routine use of melatonin after TKA.
