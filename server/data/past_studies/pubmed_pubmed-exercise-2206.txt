Study Title: Effects of high intensity interval training on serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor in individuals with PTSD.

Study Summary:
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein important for synaptic plasticity and formation of memory. It is suggested to play an important role in the development of psychiatric disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Individuals with PTSD usually show decreased BDNF levels in serum. Physical exercise has shown to be effective in increasing serum BDNF levels. As the most beneficial form of exercise to raise serum BDNF levels in individuals with PTSD is yet to be determined, we compared two training protocols and their effects on BDNF release. We expected that a training with higher intensity increases BDNF serum levels more than a low intensity training (LIT). 40 participants (80% female) diagnosed with PTSD were randomized to either high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or a low intensity training group (LIT). They underwent a 12-day training period. We measured serum BDNF levels pre- and post-exercise on first and last intervention day. BDNF was controlled for platelet counts. In the HIIT group there was a significant increase in serum BDNF post-exercise on both days measured, respectively when controlled for platelets. The increase was transient. Both groups did not show an increase in serum BDNF over the course of the 12-day training period. A single session of HIIT raised serum BDNF levels in individuals with PTSD transiently. Neither HIIT nor LIT raised serum BDNF levels over the course of 12 days.
