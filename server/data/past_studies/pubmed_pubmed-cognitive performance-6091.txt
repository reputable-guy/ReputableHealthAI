Study Title: Risk factors associated with cognitive performance and cognitive impairment in older adults with type 1 diabetes: Data from the Wireless Innovation for Seniors with Diabetes Mellitus (WISDM) study.

Study Summary:
Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are considered at increased risk for cognitive impairment and accelerated brain aging. However, longitudinal data on cognitive impairment and dementia in this population are scarce. To identify risk factors associated with cognitive performance and cognitive impairment in a longitudinal sample of older adults with T1D. We analyzed data collected as part of the Wireless Innovation for Seniors with Diabetes Mellitus (WISDM) Study, in which 22 endocrinology practices participated. Randomized participants with T1D &#x2265;60&#xa0;years of age who completed at least one cognitive assessment were included in this study (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;203). Cognitive impairment was classified using published recommendations. Older age, male sex, non-private health insurance, worse daily functioning, diagnosis of neuropathy, and longer duration of diabetes were associated with worse cognitive performance, but not cognitive impairment. 49&#xa0;% and 39&#xa0;% of the sample met criteria for cognitive impairment at baseline and 52&#xa0;weeks respectively. Of the participants that had data at both time points, 10&#xa0;% were normal at baseline and impaired at 52&#xa0;weeks and 22&#xa0;% of participants (44&#xa0;% of those classified with cognitive impairment at baseline) reverted to normal over 52&#xa0;weeks. This study indicated that several demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with worse cognitive performance in older adults with T1D, but there were no associations between these characteristics and cognitive impairment defined by NIH Toolbox cognitive impairment criteria. Caution is warranted when assessing cognition in older adults with T1D, as a large percentage of those identified as having cognitive impairment at baseline reverted to normal after 52&#xa0;weeks. There is need for future studies on the interrelationship of cognition and aging to better understand the effects of T1D on cognitive health, to improve clinical monitoring and help mitigate the risk of dementia in this population.
