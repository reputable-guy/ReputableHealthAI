Study Title: The Effects of a Functional Food Breakfast on Gluco-Regulation, Cognitive Performance, Mood, and Satiety in Adults.

Study Summary:
A whole diet which combines multiple functional foods benefits metabolic risk factors and cognition, but evidence supporting meal to meal benefits, which individuals may find easier to implement, is limited. This study developed a functional food breakfast (FB), using polyphenol-rich ingredients selected for their gluco-regulating and cognitive-enhancing properties, and compared it to a control breakfast (CB). For study 1, total polyphenols were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and sugar release by in vitro digestion, in frozen and fresh samples. In study 2, healthy adults (= 16) consumed an FB, CB and ready-to-eat breakfast cereal (RTEC) in a randomised crossover design. Glucose (GR) and insulin response (IR), satiety, mood and memory were measured over 180 min. The FB was a rich source of polyphenols (230 mg) compared to the CB (147 mg) (< 0.05), and using frozen muffins did not compromise the polyphenol content or sugar release. Peak GR was highest after the RTEC (< 0.05), and the insulin area under the curve (AUC) was lowest in the FB at 60, 120, 180 min and peak (< 0.05). There were no effects on GR AUC, mood, satiety or memory. Reductions in GR peak and IR following consumption of the FB support the inclusion of functional ingredients at breakfast.
