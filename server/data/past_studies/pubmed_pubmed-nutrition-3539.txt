Study Title: Targeting persistent fatigue with tailored versus generic self-management strategies in adolescents and young adults with a fatigue syndrome or rheumatic condition: A randomized crossover trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the use of two self-management intervention strategies for persistent fatigue in adolescents and young adults with a fatigue syndrome or rheumatic condition. A randomized crossover trial administering tailored lifestyle advice and generic dietary advice, each 12&#x2009;weeks, with a four-week washout period between. Sixty participants (aged 12-29) were included. Tailoring was achieved through the PROfeel method. Dietary guidelines were conceptualized by the Netherlands Nutrition Centre. Questionnaires were used pre-post-interventions to measure primary outcome 'fatigue severity' (Checklist Individual Strength-8) and secondary outcomes 'self-efficacy' (Self-Efficacy Scale-28) and 'quality of life' (QoL) (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0). Feasibility and adherence were self-rated on a scale of 1 to 10 (low to high). Linear mixed modelling was used to assess change over time, compare strategy effectiveness and study the impact of intervention order. Fatigue severity, self-efficacy and QoL regarding 'physical' and 'emotional' functioning improved significantly over time (all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.015). The average improvement of the two QoL subscales was clinically relevant, as was the fatigue improvement in 20 out of 46 participants who completed the trial and 5 dropouts. The interventions were equally effective, and intervention order did not impact the improvement level (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.242-.984). The self-management strategies received similar feasibility (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.45, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.91) and adherence (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.67, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.67) ratings. As small to clinically relevant improvements were observed, self-management strategies might be particularly useful to bridge waiting time for guided treatments such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.
