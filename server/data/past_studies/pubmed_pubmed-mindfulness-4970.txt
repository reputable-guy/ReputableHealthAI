Study Title: Resilience, Insight, Self-Compassion, and Empowerment (RISE): A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Psychoeducational Group Program for Nurses.

Study Summary:
Nurses tend to be vulnerable to burnout and compassion fatigue due to constant workplace stressors. There is a need to provide advocacy, education, programming, and resources in the areas of positive coping and self-care to reduce burnout symptoms and promote well-being. RISE is an 8-week psychoeducational group intervention for nurses with four themes: resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment. This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of RISE on mental well-being. The sample included 75 registered nurses who work in a hospital-based setting. Outcomes included resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, stress mind-set, perceived stress, and burnout. Independent-samplestests were conducted to compare outcomes between intervention and wait-list control groups at baseline and 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month follow-up. Supplemental analyses included paired-samplestests and linear mixed models to compare the outcomes of the intervention group participants at baseline to 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Participants in the intervention group showed improved levels of insight (i.e., engagement in self-reflection), perceived stress, and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion) when compared with the control group and improved levels of resilience, self-compassion, stress mind-set, and perceived stress when compared with their baseline. This study informs how RISE affects nurse well-being and may be an effective intervention for reducing burnout and stress. This type of whole-person intervention can support nurses to improve their well-being and ability to cope amid the complex interplay of factors at the individual, unit, and organizational levels.
