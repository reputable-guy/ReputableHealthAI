Study Title: Feasibility and Possible Effects of Mindful Walking and Moderate Walking in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study With a Nested Qualitative Study Part.

Study Summary:
Breast cancer (BC) survivors often suffer from disease- and therapy-related long-term side-effects. The study aim was to explore the feasibility, adherence, and individual experiences as well as possible effects of 2 different walking interventions in BC patients. This randomized controlled, pragmatic pilot trial included a qualitative study component. BC patients were randomized to either mindful walking (MFW) with mindfulness exercises and walking or moderate walking (MW) alone in weekly group sessions over 8&#x2009;weeks. After 8 and 16&#x2009;weeks, satisfaction, and self-perceived effectiveness as well as different health-related outcomes including health-related (WHOQOL-BREF) and disease-specific quality of life (FACT-G), perceived stress (PSQ) and cancer-related fatigue (CFS-D) were assessed. ANCOVA was used to evaluate differences in study outcomes. Qualitative data included 4 focus group interviews including 20 patients and were analyzed using a directed qualitative content analysis approach. Altogether, 51 women (mean age 55.8&#x2009;years (SD 10.9)) were randomized (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24 MFW; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27 MW). Both groups would recommend the course to other BC patients (MFW 88.9%; MW 95.2%) and showed possible improvements from baseline to week 8, without statistically significant difference between groups: WHOQOL-BREF (MFW: adjusted mean 65.4 (95% confidence interval (CI), 57.1-73.7); MW: 61.6 (53.6-69.6)); FACT-G (MFW: 76.0 (71.5-80.5); MW: 73.0 (68.5-77.4)); PSQ (MFW: 45.3 (40.5-50.1); MW: 45.4 (40.8-50.0)); CFS-D (MFW: 24.3 (20.8-27.8); MW: 25.5 (22.1-28.8)). Improvements lasted until the 16-weeks follow-up. The qualitative analysis suggested that MFW primarily promoted mindfulness, self-care, and acceptability in BC patients, whereas MW activated and empowered the patients as a result of the physical exercise. Both study interventions were positively evaluated by patients and showed possible pre-post effects in disease-specific health-related outcomes without differences between groups. The qualitative analysis results indicate that different resources and coping strategies were addressed by the 2 study interventions.
