Study Title: Employee Group Coaching Program for University and Hospital Employees During COVID-19: A Feasibility Study.

Study Summary:
Workplace wellbeing programs can be beneficial but range widely in approach. A group coaching model offers numerous benefits. To evaluate feasibility of group coaching for employees during COVID-19. Employees (n = 29) at a university and university hospital underwent a 12-week group coaching program. Measurements of feasibility -- including enrollment, attendance at sessions goal attainment and satisfaction -- and exploratory outcomes including perceived physical and mental health and stress were administered at beginning, middle, and end of the program, plus 2 follow-ups. Twenty-six of the 29 program enrollees (96% women; 65% university employees) opted to complete surveys at 1 or more time points, and 9 individuals completed surveys at all 5 time points. Median attendance was 9 sessions. Participants opted to focus on movement, nutrition and mind/body goals and all participants reported making progress toward their goal during the program. Exploratory wellness outcomes showed meaningful improvements in perceived physical and mental health and reduced stress during the program, with return to near baseline 12&#xa0;weeks after program completion. Perceptions of workplace wellness culture varied by employer. Despite pandemic-related disruptions to life, work, and health, online group coaching is feasible and acceptable to participants. The program should be replicated to evaluate whether the improvements in exploratory wellness outcomes observed during the program are statistically significant. The apparent return to baseline levels by 24&#xa0;weeks suggests that post-program maintenance support may be helpful.
