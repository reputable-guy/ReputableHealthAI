Study Title: Effects of a behavioral intervention on physical activity, diet, and health-related quality of life in postpartum women with elevated weight: results of the HIPP randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Approaches to improve physical activity (PA), diet, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during postpartum in diverse women with elevated weight are needed. Health In Pregnancy and Postpartum (HIPP) was a randomized controlled trial that followed African American and white women with overweight or obesity from pregnancy through 12&#xa0;months postpartum. Participants were randomized to a behavioral intervention grounded in social cognitive theory (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;112) or standard care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;107). From enrollment (&#x2264;&#x2009;18&#xa0;weeks gestation) through 6&#xa0;months postpartum, the intervention group received two in-depth counseling sessions (one each during pregnancy and postpartum), counseling calls, behavioral podcasts, and access to a private Facebook group, while the standard care group received monthly mailings and podcasts focused on healthy pregnancy and infant development. PA (SenseWear armband), diet (ASA24), and HRQOL (SF-12) measurements were obtained from blinded assessors at baseline and 6- and 12-months postpartum. Linear or quantile regression models, depending on conformity to normality assumptions, were used to test differences between behavioral intervention and standard groups in PA outcomes (minutes/day of total PA, light PA, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA), and total steps/day), dietary outcomes (diet quality and six measures of dietary intake), and HRQOL at 6- and 12-months postpartum, controlling for baseline values, race, parity, weight status, education, maternal age, gestational age, and caloric intake (for most diet models). There were no statistically significant differences by group for any PA, diet, or HRQOL outcomes at 6 or 12&#xa0;months postpartum. Irrespective of group assignment, all PA outcomes improved from pregnancy to postpartum, as did kcals and the mental component of HRQOL. Furthermore, while not statistically significant, virtually all PA outcomes, except MVPA at 12&#xa0;months, and several dietary outcomes, including diet quality, had patterns favoring the intervention group but with small effect sizes. Postpartum PA, diet, and HRQOL did not differ significantly between women in the behavioral intervention group and those in the standard care group. Given the increased responsibilities and stress that women face during the postpartum period, this appears to be a challenging time to make lifestyle changes. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 10/09/2014. Identifier: NCT02260518.
