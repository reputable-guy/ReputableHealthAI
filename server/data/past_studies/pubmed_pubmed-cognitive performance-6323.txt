Study Title: Portable HEPA Filter Air Cleaner Use during Pregnancy and Children's Cognitive Performance at Four Years of Age: The UGAAR Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Developmental exposure to air pollution is associated with diminished cognitive abilities in observational studies, but no randomized controlled trial has examined the effect of reducing air pollution on cognition in children. We sought to quantify the impact of reducing exposure to particulate matter (PM) during pregnancy on children's cognitive performance at 4 y of age. In this single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, we randomly assigned 540 nonsmoking pregnant women (268 intervention and 272 control) to receive 1-2 portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaners or no air cleaners. The air cleaners were used from a median of 11 wk gestation until the end of pregnancy. The primary outcome was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) when children were a median of 48 months old. We imputed missing outcome data using multiple imputation with chained equations, and our primary analysis was by intention to treat. After excluding known miscarriages, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and medical conditions that impeded cognitive testing and imputation, 475 (233 control and 242 intervention) children were included in our analyses. In an unadjusted analysis, the mean FSIQ of children who were randomly assigned to the intervention group was 2.5 points [95% confidence interval (CI):, 5.4 points] higher than that of children in the control group. After adjustment to account for an imbalance in preterm birth between groups, the effect estimate increased to 2.8 points (95% CI:, 5.7). Reducing PM air pollution during pregnancy may improve cognitive performance in childhood. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10302.
