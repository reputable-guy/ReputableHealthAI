Study Title: Continuous cuff pressure control on middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection of the esophagus effect of airway injury.

Study Summary:
Assessment of the effect of continuous cuff pressure control on airway injury in middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). A total of 104 eligible middle-aged and elderly patients requiring esophageal ESD from July 2022-September 2023 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the group undergoing general anesthesia tracheal intubation with continuous control of cuff pressure after intubation (Group A, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51) and the group undergoing general anesthesia tracheal intubation with continuous monitoring without control of cuff pressure (Group B, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;53). After endotracheal intubation in Group A, under the guidance of an automatic cuff pressure controller, the air was used to inflate the tracheal cuff until the cuff pressure was 25-30cmHO. The cuff pressure after intubation was recorded, and then the cuff pressure parameters were directly adjusted in the range of 25-30cmHO until tracheal extubation after the operation. After endotracheal intubation, patients in Group B inflated the tracheal cuff with clinical experience, then monitored and recorded the cuff pressure with a handheld cuff manometer and instructed the cuff not to be loosened after being connected to the handheld cuff manometer-continuous monitoring until the tracheal extubation, but without any cuff pressure regulation. The patients of the two groups performed esophageal ESD. The left recumbent position was taken before the operation, and the cuff's pressure was recorded. Then, insert the gastrointestinal endoscope to find the lesion site and perform appropriate COinflation to display the diseased esophageal wall for surgical operation fully. After determining the location, the cuff pressure of the two groups was recorded when the cuff pressure was stable. After the operation, the upper gastrointestinal endoscope was removed and the cuff pressure of the two groups was recorded. Postoperative airway injury assessment was performed in both groups, and the incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, cough, and blood in sputum was recorded. The incidence of postoperative airway mucosal injury was also observed and recorded in both groups: typical, episodic congestion spots and patchy local congestion. The incidence of normal airway mucosa in Group A was higher than that in Group B (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In comparison, the incidence of occasional hyperemia and local plaque congestion in Group A was lower than in Group B (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Continuous cuff pressure control during operation can reduce airway injury in patients with esophageal ESD and accelerate their early recovery after the operation.
