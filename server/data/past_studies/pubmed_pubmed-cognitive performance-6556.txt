Study Title: Enhanced physical and cognitive performance in active duty Airmen: evidence from a randomized multimodal physical fitness and nutritional intervention.

Study Summary:
Achieving military mission objectives requires high levels of performance from Airmen who operate under extreme physical and cognitive demands. Thus, there is a critical need to establish scientific interventions to enhance physical fitness and cognitive performance-promoting the resilience of Airmen and aiding in mission success. We therefore conducted a comprehensive, 12-week randomized controlled trial in active-duty Air Force Airmen (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;148) to compare the efficacy of a multimodal intervention comprised of high-intensity interval aerobic fitness and strength training paired with a novel nutritional supplement [comprised of &#x3b2;-hydroxy &#x3b2;-methylbutyrate (HMB), lutein, phospholipids, DHA and selected micronutrients including B12 and folic acid] to high-intensity interval aerobic fitness and strength training paired with a standard of care placebo beverage. The exercise intervention alone improved several dimensions of physical fitness [strength and endurance (+&#xa0;8.3%), power (+&#xa0;0.85%), mobility and stability (+&#x2009;22%), heart rate (-&#x2009;1.1%) and lean muscle mass (+&#x2009;1.4%)] and cognitive function [(episodic memory (+&#x2009;9.5%), processing efficiency (+&#x2009;7.5%), executive function reaction time (-&#x2009;4.8%) and fluid intelligence accuracy (+&#x2009;19.5%)]. Relative to exercise training alone, the multimodal fitness and nutritional intervention further improved working memory (+&#x2009;9.0%), fluid intelligence reaction time (-&#x2009;7.7%), processing efficiency (+&#x2009;1.8%), heart rate (-&#x2009;2.4%) and lean muscle mass (+&#x2009;1.5%). These findings establish the efficacy of a multimodal intervention that incorporates aerobic fitness and strength training with a novel nutritional supplement to enhance military performance objectives and to provide optimal exercise training and nutritional support for the modern warfighter.
