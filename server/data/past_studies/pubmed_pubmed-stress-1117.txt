Study Title: Facilitating and limiting factors in the implementation of Revie &#x2295; among registered nurses: A multimethod study.

Study Summary:
People with advanced cancer face long-term physical, psychological, and existential challenges. Revie &#x2295; is a life review intervention based on building the strengths and resources of these patients. A randomized clinical trial evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention on self-esteem, well-being, personal development, life satisfaction and perceived interaction with registered nurses. In addition, the research team analysed the process of implementation with registered nurses, which is the subject of the present study. The aim of our study was to describe the facilitating or limiting factors in the implementation of Revie &#x2295; with registered nurses in oncology units. This study used a multimethod cross-sectional research design and was conducted in the context of a randomized controlled trial. The selected sample included 57 registered nurses. Organizational readiness for change, satisfaction, and compassion fatigue were measured for the quantitative component, and two focus groups were conducted for the qualitative component. Organizational readiness for change reveals favourable results conducive to the implementation of Revie &#x2295;. The professional quality of life measures highlighted high compassion satisfaction and a low risk of burnout and exposure to secondary traumatic stress. Participants with additional postgraduate training felt more strongly that the intervention was evidence-based, considered clinical experience, and respected patient preferences. The analysis of the qualitative data allowed for the extraction of 7 themes and 21 subthemes. This study highlighted facilitating and limiting factors in the implementation process of Revie &#x2295;, good professional quality of life of registered nurses, and supportive preparation for change.
