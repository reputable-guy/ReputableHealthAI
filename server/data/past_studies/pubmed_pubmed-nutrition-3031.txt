Study Title: Use of digital food records in clinical settings: lessons in translation from a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Digital food records offer efficiencies in collecting and assessing dietary information remotely; however, research into factors impacting their translation into clinical settings is limited. The study examined factors that may impact the integration of digital food records into clinical dietetic practice by assessing (1) the source and rate of data errors received, (2) the impact of dietitian-adjusted data on dietary variables and (3) the acceptance of use in a complex chronic condition cohort. Adults from specialist clinics enroled in a randomised controlled feasibility trial participated. Participants recorded their dietary intake using a mobile food diary application (Research Food diary, Xyris Software Pty Ltd.); it was analysed via electronic nutrition analysis software (FoodWorks, Xyris Software Pty Ltd.). Records were verified and corrected by a dietitian. Dietary variables assessed before (participant-unadjusted data) and after (dietitian-adjusted data) were compared by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Bland-Altman and Passing-Bablok analysis. Surveys and Interviews assessed participants'; acceptance of the mobile application's usability. Errors appeared in 93% of records. Dietitian-adjusted median data were higher for most variables compared to participant-unadjusted median data (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05, median changes between 0.0% and 64.7%) of 59 participant records (median age 51 years, interquartile range 38-58). There was poor agreement between participant-unadjusted and dietitian-adjusted data for some dietary variables. Sixty-four percent surveyed (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;32/50) found the app easy to use, whereas 29 interviews provided insights into facilitators and challenges of use. Significant barriers to integrating digital food records into clinical settings exist requiring dietitian adjustment to correct errors which has major implications for estimates of diet quality and intake.
