Study Title: Effect of Alpinia galanga on Mental Alertness and Sustained Attention With or Without Caffeine: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Although Alpinia galanga has been reported to improve cognitive performance in animals, it has not been thoroughly studied for its potential psychostimulant effect in humans. A randomized, double-dummy, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study was conducted to determine the effect of A galanga on mental alertness and sustained attention in comparison with caffeine and placebo in participants with a habitual caffeine intake. Fifty-nine participants (18-40&#xa0;years and body mass index of &#x2265;18.5 and <25.00&#xa0;kg/m) with moderate caffeine consumption were enrolled. The participants had a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score &#x2264;7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score &#x2264;14 and a Jin Fan's Attention Network Test alertness score of 50 &#xb1; 20 ms. The interventional product (placebo, A galanga proprietary extract [E-AG-01], caffeine, and a combination of E-AG-01 with caffeine) was administered to the participants, followed by sequential administration of the remaining interventions on the consecutive study visits; the effects on mental alertness, sustained attention, and sleep architecture, along with safety and tolerability, were analyzed by validated methods. In the E-AG-01 group, the alertness score was increased by 11.65 &#xb1; 23.94, 12.50 &#xb1; 19.73, and 12.62 &#xb1; 0.68 ms from baseline at 1, 3 (p = 0.042), and 5&#xa0;hours, respectively, indicating its efficacy to enhance mental alertness and the increase in alertness score as compared to placebo. In the composite group (E-AG-01 with caffeine), mean response time was significantly reduced, by 15.55 ms (p = 0.026) at 3&#xa0;hours. A galanga (E-AG-01) induces a beneficial effect in mental alertness and the combination of A galanga with caffeine impedes the caffeine crash and improves sustained attention at 3&#xa0;hours. Thus, these stimulant effects might yield a new usage for A galanga as a key ingredient in energy drinks or similar products.
