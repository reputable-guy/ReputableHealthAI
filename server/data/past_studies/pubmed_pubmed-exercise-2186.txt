Study Title: The long-term effects of different telerehabilitation programs on respiratory, exercise, and activity-related parameters in COVID-19 survivors: a randomized controlled trial in T&#xfc;rkiye.

Study Summary:
The long-term outcomes of different telerehabilitation gains for discharged COVID-19 patients are largely uncertain, and this point needs to be explored. This study aimed to research the effectiveness of telerehabilitation and compare the long-term results of videoconferencing-guided synchronous telerehabilitation and mobile application-guided asynchronous telerehabilitation programs, as well as determine the correlation between clinical and hemodynamic parameters. Exercise programs including aerobic exercises, strengthening exercises, and pulmonary exercises were given to COVID-19 patients discharged from the Kartal Dr. L&uuml;tfi Kirdar City Hospital in Istanbul, T&uuml;rkiye between August 2021 and January 2022, by videoconferencing or mobile application telerehabilitation. All patients underwent programs three times per week for 8 weeks. Lower extremity strength and functional status were assessed using a 30-second sit-to-stand test (30 s STS); physical activity level was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ); pulse oximetry was used to determine oxygen saturation and heart rate; and dyspnea and fatigue were assessed using a modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale. Baseline, post-treatment, and long-term data were analyzed. A total of 27 patients completed the study. Significant improvement was seen in all parameters in long-term results with telerehabilitation programs (p<0.05). Especially in the between-group effect at rest (p=0.031) and post-exertion oxygen saturation (p=0.004), there were significant differences in favor of videoconferencing. Oxygen saturation was negatively correlated with dyspnea and fatigue (p<0.05). Post-exercise, dyspnea showed a moderate positive correlation with fatigue (r=0.582, p=0.001) and heart rate (r=0.412, p=0.033), while it exhibited a moderate negative correlation with 30 s STS (r=-0.424, p=0.027) and IPAQ (r=-0.401, p=0.038). Both methods generally provide positive gains in clinical and hemodynamic parameters, but the videoconferencing results were slightly better. Saturation at rest and dyspnea after exertion can provide a brief prediction about the cardiopulmonary system. Our findings are important for individuals who have access problems to the clinic and city center, and can be used for follow-up and treatment approaches.
