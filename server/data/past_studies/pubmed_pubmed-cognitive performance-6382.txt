Study Title: Assessment of Glycemic Response to Model Breakfasts Varying in Glycemic Index (GI) in 5-7-Year-Old School Children.

Study Summary:
Reduced Glycemic Index (GI) of breakfast has been linked to improved cognitive performance in both children and adult populations across the morning. However, few studies have profiled the post-prandial glycemic response (PPGR) in younger children. The aim of this study was to assess PPGR to breakfast interventions differing in GI in healthy children aged 5-7 years. Eleven subjects completed an open-label, randomized, cross-over trial, receiving three equicaloric test beverages (260 kcal) consisting of 125 mL semi-skimmed milk and 50 g sugar (either glucose, sucrose, or isomaltulose). On a fourth occasion, the sucrose beverage was delivered as intermittent supply. PPGR was measured over 180 min using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). The incremental area under the curve (3h-iAUC) was highest for the glucose beverage, followed by intermittent sucrose (-21%,= 0.288), sucrose (-27%,= 0.139), and isomaltulose (-48%,= 0.018). The isomaltulose beverage induced the smallest Cmax (7.8 mmol/L vs. >9.2 mmol/L for others) and the longest duration with moderate glucose level, between baseline value and 7.8 mmol/L (150 vs. <115 min for others). These results confirm that substituting mid-high GI sugars (e.g., sucrose and glucose) with low GI sugars (e.g., isomaltulose) during breakfast are a viable strategy for sustained energy release and glycemic response during the morning even in younger children.
