Study Title: A WIC-Based Behavior Change Intervention for Postpartum Women With Overweight and Obesity: A Pilot Feasibility Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
. Postpartum weight retention is a risk factor for obesity and is particularly important among Hispanic women who have an increased rate of obesity. Given its broad reach, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program provides an ideal setting to implement community-based interventions for low-income postpartum women.. To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a multicomponent intervention delivered by staff within the WIC program designed to promote behavior changes in urban, postpartum women with overweight/obesity.. This was a 12-week pilot trial randomizing participants to a health behavior change (Intervention) or control (Observation) group. The Intervention included monthly visits with trained WIC staff providing patient-centered behavior change counseling, with multiple touchpoints between visits promoting self-monitoring and offering health behavior change support.. Participants (n = 41), who were mainly Hispanic (n = 37, 90%) and Spanish-speaking (n = 33, 81%), were randomized to the Intervention (n = 19) or Observation (n = 22) group. In the Intervention group, 79% (n = 15) of eligible participants were retained for the study duration. All Intervention participants endorsed that they would participate again. Regarding physical activity, participant readiness to change and self-efficacy improved for Intervention participants. About one-quarter of women in the Intervention group (27%, n = 4) had a 5% weight loss compared with one woman (5%) in the Observation group; this difference was not statistically significant (p = .10).. This pilot demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a low-intensity behavior change intervention within the WIC setting for postpartum women with overweight/obesity. Findings support the role of WIC in addressing postpartum obesity.
