Study Title: The effect of a 2 week ketogenic diet, versus a carbohydrate-based diet, on cognitive performance, mood and subjective sleepiness during 36&#x2009;h of extended wakefulness in military personnel: An exploratory study.

Study Summary:
Extended wakefulness, or sleep deprivation, impairs cognitive performance and brain glucose metabolism. A ketogenic diet (KD) provides an alternative fuel source, ketone bodies, that could elicit a metabolic benefit during sleep deprivation. A randomised, cross-over trial was conducted with seven male military personnel. Participants ingested an iso-energetic ketogenic diet or carbohydrate-based diet for 14&#x2009;days, immediately followed by 36&#x2009;h of extended wakefulness and separated by a 12 day washout. Cognitive performance, mood, subjective sleepiness, capillary blood glucose, and D-&#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were measured every 2&#x2009;h during extended wakefulness. Linear mixed models were used to analyse data. D-&#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate was higher (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and glucose was lower (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) on the KD compared with the carbohydrate-based diet. The KD improved psychomotor vigilance task performance (number of lapses, mean reciprocal response time, mean fastest 10% response time (RT), and mean slowest 10% RT; all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), running memory continuous performance test performance (RT and number of correct responses per minute; both p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), and vigour, fatigue, and sleepiness (all, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001) compared with the carbohydrate-based diet. In conclusion, a KD demonstrated beneficial effects on cognitive performance, mood, and sleepiness during 36&#x2009;h of extended wakefulness compared with a carbohydrate-based diet.
