Study Title: Comparison of dry needling with exercise and exercise alone on spasticity, range of motion, and function of post-stroke chronic spastic patients.

Study Summary:
Stroke is a common cause of disability and death in adults, with spasticity being a common post-stroke complication that can significantly affect patients' quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the impact of exercise therapy alone versus exercise therapy combined with dry needling on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic spasticity after stroke. Forty patients were randomly assigned to either a control or intervention group. The control group received a standard exercise program consisting of two sessions per week for six weeks. The intervention group received the same exercise program in addition to dry needling of the hip and leg muscles. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale, Timed Up & Go Test, and goniometer in four separate examination sessions. The findings of this study suggest that the addition of dry needling to exercise therapy led to faster and longer-lasting improvements in clinical outcomes. The intervention group showed significant improvements in spasticity, range of motion, and function in the second through fourth examination sessions, while the control group's improvements decreased over time. Between-group comparisons revealed significantly greater improvements in the intervention group than the control group. The findings suggest that combining dry needling with exercise therapy may be beneficial in managing post-stroke spasticity. Dry needling may lead to faster and more significant improvements in clinical outcomes, ultimately improving function and quality of life for patients with chronic spasticity after stroke.
