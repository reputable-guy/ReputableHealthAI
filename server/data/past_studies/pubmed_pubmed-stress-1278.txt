Study Title: Incorporating the Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine into Physician Assistant/Associate Education: A Benefit for Patients, Physician Assistants/Associate Education, and Physician Assistants/Associates.

Study Summary:
The value of using lifestyle medicine (LM) to prevent disease is well established, yet medical education about LM is inconsistent, for both physicians and physician assistants/associates (PAs). As medical providers, PAs are uniquely positioned, with careers in a variety of disciplines from primary care to intensive care, as well as an ability to move across disciplines throughout their career lifespan. Therefore, the addition of LM principles in PA education can affect patients across the lifespan and in a wide variety of clinical settings. In addition, with burnout prevalent among PA students, the addition of LM to PA education may be able to give these future clinicians the tools they need to manage stress and improve overall wellness. The purpose of this study was to share with PA educators the valuable lessons learned when introducing LM into PA curriculum in hopes of broader adoption. The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) provides modules for teaching LM to medical providers which was adopted into the Northeastern University PA Program's didactic curriculum in the summer of 2023. An online survey was administered to first-year PA students in July 2023 to evaluate the PA students' perspectives on the value of adding a LM curriculum as part of their education to care for patients and the content provided through ACLM and to determine their perceived value in using the information for themselves as part of preventing future provider burnout. Most respondents (91%) indicated that they were either "likely" or "very likely" to use the information learned in the LM modules as part of their future patient care, and 86.4% indicated that they would use the information as part of their own self-care. Most PA student respondents (88.6%) thought that the components of LM complemented the existing PA curriculum in primary care and (86.4%) indicated that they will use the information as part of their own self-care. However, given the intense volume of information provided to PA students for their general primary care education, it was suggested to pare down the volume of materials to streamline the curriculum. Overall, these PA students believe that LM should comprise a portion of their PA medical education curricula for their patients and for themselves.
