Study Title: An online self-study mindfulness-based stress reduction course for people suffering from mental fatigue after an acquired brain injury.

Study Summary:
The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program has shown promising results for people suffering from mental fatigue after an acquired brain injury. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of a MBSR program performed as an online self-study course for this group of people. Sixty participants who had suffered an acquired brain injury with lasting mental fatigue were randomized to an online MBSR course or to a waitlist control group. They answered self-report questionnaires before start and after the course. Sixteen completed the MBSR program. With the repeated ANOVA no significant difference between groups was found, although there was a significant change in time (the repetition factor). The post-hoc paired t-test indicated a significant reduction and a large-to-median effect size in mental fatigue (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.896), depression (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.569) and anxiety (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.598) for the MBSR group. No significant changes were found for the control group. An online self-study MBSR program for people suffering from mental fatigue after an acquired brain injury can be a feasible option for those suffering from less severe mental fatigue and emotional symptoms, while others may require a program adapted to their needs.
