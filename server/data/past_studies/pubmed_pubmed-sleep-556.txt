Study Title: Improved physical functioning, sleep, work productivity and overall health-related quality of life with bimekizumab in patients with axial spondyloarthritis: results from two phase 3 studies.

Study Summary:
To assess the impact of bimekizumab on physical functioning, sleep, work productivity and overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with non-radiographic (nr-) and radiographic (r-) axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in the phase 3 studies BE MOBILE 1 and 2. Patients were randomised to subcutaneous bimekizumab 160&#x2009;mg or placebo every 4 weeks; from Week 16, all patients received bimekizumab 160&#x2009;mg every 4 weeks. We report the following outcomes to Week 52: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale Revised (MOS-Sleep-R) Index II, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: axSpA (WPAI:axSpA), Short Form-36 Physical and Mental Component Summary (SF-36 PCS/MCS) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL). At Week 16, bimekizumab-randomised patients demonstrated significantly greater improvement from baseline versus placebo in BASFI, SF-36 PCS and ASQoL (p<0.001), and numerically greater improvements in MOS-Sleep-R Index II and WPAI:axSpA scores. Higher proportions of bimekizumab-randomised versus placebo-randomised patients at Week 16 achieved increasingly stringent thresholds for improvements in BASFI (0 to &#x2264;4), and thresholds for meaningful improvements in SF-36 PCS (&#x2265;5-point increase from baseline) and ASQoL (&#x2265;4-point decrease from baseline). Responses were sustained or further improved to Week 52, where 60%-70% of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved BASFI &#x2264;4&#x2009;and meaningful improvements in SF-36 PCS and ASQoL, regardless of whether originally randomised to bimekizumab or placebo. Bimekizumab treatment led to early improvements in physical function, sleep, work productivity and overall HRQoL at Week 16 in patients across the full axSpA disease spectrum. Improvements were sustained to Week 52. NCT03928704; NCT03928743.
