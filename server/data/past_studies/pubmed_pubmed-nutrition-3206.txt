Study Title: Effect of acute meal and long-term intake of a Mediterranean Diet providing different amounts of carbohydrates on physical performance and biomarkers in non-professional strength athletes.

Study Summary:
The study aims to evaluate the effect of an acute meal and long-term intake of Mediterranean Diet (MD) on different parameters such as strength, physical performance, body composition and blood markers in a group of non-professional athletes who practice a strength activity. Thirteen volunteers completed two 8-week dietary interventions in a randomised, cross-over design. Also an acute study was performed. Subjects received a MD High in carbohydrates, characterised by at least five portions of pasta/week and an average 55-60% of daily energy derived from carbohydrates, versus an MD reduced in carbohydrates, with less than two portions of pasta/week and an average of 40-45% of daily energy provided by carbohydrates. Mainly, data did not show significant differences for the parameters analysed, except for Elbow Flexor maximum voluntary contraction (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.039). Results enlighten that increasing total carbohydrates intake, as typically in the MD, does not negatively affect physical performance, body composition and strength.
