Study Title: Mindfulness group intervention improved self-compassion and resilience of children from single-parent families in Tibetan areas.

Study Summary:
The current study aimed to examine the effects of a mindfulness group intervention on self-compassion, psychological resilience, and mental health of children from single-parent families in Tibetan areas. A total of 64 children from single-parent families in Tibetan areas were randomly allocated to a control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32) and an intervention group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32). Participants in the control group received conventional education, while participants in the intervention group received 6-week mindfulness intervention in addition to the conventional education. Both groups completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-compassion Scale (SCS), Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescent (RSCA), and the Mental Health Test (MHT) before and after the intervention. After the intervention, the levels of mindfulness and self-compassion in the intervention group were significantly improved in relative to the control group. The positive cognition in the RSCA was significantly increased in the intervention group, whereas no significant change was observed in the control group. There was a trend towards lower self-blame in the MHT, but no significant impact of the intervention on the overall level of mental health was found. Results suggest that a 6-week mindfulness training effectively improve self-compassion and resilience of single-parent children. Thus, mindfulness training as a cost-effective approach can be arranged in the curriculum, which helps students develop high level of self-compassion and resilience. In addition, there may be a need to improve emotional control in order to improve mental health.
