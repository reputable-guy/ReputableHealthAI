Study Title: Patient Education Improves Pain and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Established Spinal Osteoporosis in Primary Care-A Pilot Study of Short- and Long-Term Effects.

Study Summary:
Fragility fractures, in particular vertebral fractures, are associated with high morbidity, including chronic pain and reduced health-related quality of life. We aimed to investigate the short- and long-term effects of patient education, including interdisciplinary themes, with or without physical training or mindfulness/medical yoga for patients with established spinal osteoporosis in primary care. Osteoporotic persons aged sixty years or older with one or more vertebral fractures were randomized to theory only, theory and physical exercise, or theory and mindfulness/medical yoga and were scheduled to once a week for ten weeks. Participants were followed up by clinical tests and questionnaires. Twenty-one participants completed the interventions and the one-year follow-up. Adherence to interventions was 90%. Pooled data from all participants showed significant improvements after intervention on pain during the last week and worst pain, and reduced painkiller use (any painkillers at baseline 70% [opioids 25%] vs. post-intervention 52% [opioids 14%]). Significant improvements were seen regarding RAND-36 social function, Qualeffo-41 social function, balance, tandem walking backwards, and theoretical knowledge. These changes were maintained at the 1-year follow-up. Patient group education combined with supervised training seems to have positive effects on pain, and physical function in persons with established spinal osteoporosis. The improved quality of life was maintained at the 1-year follow-up.
