Study Title: A mobile healthy lifestyle intervention to promote mental health in adolescence: a mixed-methods evaluation.

Study Summary:
A healthy lifestyle may improve mental health. It is yet not known whether and how a mobile intervention can be of help in achieving this in adolescents. This study investigated the effectiveness and perceived underlying mechanisms of the mobile health (mHealth) intervention #LIFEGOALS to promote healthy lifestyles and mental health. #LIFEGOALS is an evidence-based app with activity tracker, including self-regulation techniques, gamification elements, a support chatbot, and health narrative videos. A quasi-randomized controlled trial (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;279) with 12-week intervention period and process evaluation interviews (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents (12-15y) from the general population were allocated at school-level to the intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;184) or to a no-intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;95). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological well-being, mood, self-perception, peer support, resilience, depressed feelings, sleep quality and breakfast frequency were assessed via a web-based survey; physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep routine via Axivity accelerometers. Multilevel generalized linear models were fitted to investigate intervention effects and moderation by pandemic-related measures. Interviews were coded using thematic analysis. Non-usage attrition was high: 18% of the participants in the intervention group never used the app. An additional 30% stopped usage by the second week. Beneficial intervention effects were found for physical activity (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.36, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04), sedentary behavior (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.44, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01), sleep quality (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.11, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01), and mood (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.30, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02). However, effects on activity-related behavior were only present for adolescents having normal sports access, and effects on mood only for adolescents with full in-school education. HRQoL (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.72, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), mood (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.03, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01), and peer support (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;13.69, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) worsened in adolescents with pandemic-induced remote-education. Interviewees reported that the reward system, self-regulation guidance, and increased health awareness had contributed to their behavior change. They also pointed to the importance of social factors, quality of technology and autonomy for mHealth effectiveness. #LIFEGOALS showed mixed results on health behaviors and mental health. The findings highlight the role of contextual factors for mHealth promotion in adolescence, and provide suggestions to optimize support by a chatbot and narrative episodes.
