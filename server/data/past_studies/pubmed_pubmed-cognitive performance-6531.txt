Study Title: Neurobehavioural functions during variable and stable short sleep schedules.

Study Summary:
We investigated whether variable sleep schedules might mitigate the neurobehavioural deficits induced by multiple nights of sleep restriction. In this 4-night experiment, 78 young adults (age: 18-28&#xa0;years) were randomly assigned to four groups: 8888, 8666, 8846 and 8486, where each digit corresponded to time-in-bed in hours for each study night. After one baseline night of 8-hr time-in-bed, time-in-bed remained unchanged for the 8888 group, while the other groups had short sleep schedules (total time-in-bed =&#xa0;18&#xa0;hr) that differed in the number of time-in-bed changes. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy at home. Daytime neurobehavioural functions were assessed in the laboratory at single time points, after the baseline night, and again after 3&#x2005;nights of the sleep manipulation period. For sustained attention, the 8888 group responded faster in the Psychomotor Vigilance Task after the manipulation period (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.01), while responses became slower for the less variable sleep schedules (8666 and 8846; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.01), but not the most variable sleep schedule (8486; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.14). Processing speed also improved in the 8888 group and the variable 8846 and 8486 groups (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.01), but not in the stable 8666 group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.09). Furthermore, subjective sleepiness was preserved in the 8888 and, importantly, 8486 groups (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;.05), but was elevated in the 8666 and 8846 groups (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05). These findings suggest that when sleep opportunities are limited across multiple nights, a variable sleep schedule that allows for prophylactic and/or recovery sleep on some nights may mitigate some daytime neurobehavioural deficits as compared with a schedule with no opportunity for recovery.
