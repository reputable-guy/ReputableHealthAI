Study Title: Hypercapnia impaired cognitive and memory functions in obese patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.

Study Summary:
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleep disorder involving repeated nocturnal desaturation and sleep fragmentation. OSA can result in decreased daytime alertness and neurocognitive dysfunction. Hypercapnia status is also related to neurocognitive dysfunction in patients with pulmonary diseases. We evaluated the effects of hypercapnia on cognitive performance and memory function in a prospective case-controlled study. We enrolled thirty-nine obese patients with OSA and collected their arterial blood samples. All the participants provided arterial blood samples, and completed two questionnaires (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and six cognitive tasks (the psychomotor vigilance task [PVT], the Stroop task, the Eriksen flanker task, processing speed [DSST], and verbal and visual memory [LM&FM]), which were used to evaluate daytime sleepiness, cognitive function, and memory function within one week of a polysomnographic study. When compared to the OSA without diurnal hypoventilation, the patients with stable hypercapnia (OHS) had increased reaction times in the PVT, Stroop task, and flanker task. Hypercapnic obese patients with OSA also had comparatively significantly lower scores in the processing speed and logical memory tests. OHS had increased reaction times in the attention and cognitive function assessments, and deficits in the logical memory, when compared to those with OSA without diurnal hypoventilation.
