Study Title: Role of Nutraceuticals and Physical Activity in Parkinson's Disease Risk and Lifestyle Management.

Study Summary:
Parkinson's disease is a complicated, gradually progressive neurological illness characterized by locomotor and non-motor symptomatology that impedes daily activities. Despite significant advances in symptomatic therapies with various extents of negative effects, there are currently no disease-modifying medicinal alternatives. Symptoms worsen, creating an additional strain that reduces living quality and creates the perception that prescription drugs are no longer productive. Adopting healthy lifestyle habits can help patients feel more empowered, promote wellness, relieve symptoms, and potentially slow neurodegeneration. Nutrition, intellectual stimulation, physical exercise, and stress reduction are all examples of lifestyle habits that improve cognitive health and life satisfaction. We discuss how changes in lifestyle, nutrition, yoga, exercise, and acupuncture can help with managing the disease's symptoms. We searched Google Scholar for various research papers and review articles from publishers, such as Bentham Science, Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, Springer Nature, and others for gathering the data for the study. Pesticide exposure, environmental hazards, dietary choices, stress, and anxiety all have an indirect or immediate influence on the commencement of Parkinson's disease. Naturopathic remedies, such as nutraceuticals, yoga, exercise, and acupuncture, have been shown to help with Parkinson's disease management. Various preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the various factors mentioned are beneficial in the management of the disease, but more research is needed to validate the extent to which such factors are beneficial.
