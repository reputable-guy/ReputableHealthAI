Study Title: Effect of combined physical-cognitive training on the functional and cognitive capacity of older people with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The increase in population aging highlights the growing prevalence of mild cognitive impairment, prompting the adoption of interventions that combine physical exercise and cognitive training to improve health and cognitive performance in older adults. The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of a combined program on physical and cognitive health in older people with cognitive impairment. A 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial involving 95 participants (aged 72.12&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.25&#xa0;years), 47 individuals participated in a control group (CG) that only underwent cognitive stimulation, while 48 individuals were in an experimental group (EG) that participated in a combined program. Balance was measured using the Tinetti scale, upper body strength was assessed with the arm curl test, lower body strength was evaluated with the 30-s chair stand test, flexibility was tested using the back scratch test and chair sit-and-reach test, physical function was measured with the Timed Up and Go test, cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination, cognitive impairment was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, verbal fluency was tested with the Isaac test, and executive functions were assessed using the Trail Making Test. The results of the study show significant improvements in both physical and cognitive aspects, such as balance, gait, upper and lower body strength, flexibility, physical function, cognitive function, cognitive impairment, verbal fluency, and executive functions in the group that carried out the intervention compared to the control group. A combined program for older individuals with mild cognitive impairment leads to enhancements in physical and cognitive health. These improvements underscore the importance of integrating physical exercise with cognitive training as an effective strategy for enhancing overall health and quality of life in older adults.
