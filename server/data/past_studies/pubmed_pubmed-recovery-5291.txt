Study Title: The growth and diversity of the evidence base for the clubhouse model.

Study Summary:
The Clubhouse Model is a long-standing form of psychosocial rehabilitation that has been in existence for over 75 years. Today, over 350 Clubhouse programs in 33 countries affiliate with Clubhouse International and operate as nonclinical community-based recovery centers for adults and young adults living with mental illness. Clubhouses provide a strengths-based approach to recovery and offer participants, referred to as members, a variety of supports and services including assistance with obtaining and maintaining community-based employment, education, housing, social integration, outreach and advocacy, wellness and health promotion activities, and linkages to medical and psychiatric services. There is evidence and support for the Clubhouse Model in improving quality of life and social functioning, reducing hospitalization(s) and/or psychiatric symptoms, and promoting employment. This special issue has nine articles that highlight ongoing research collaborations from across the globe that examine the impact of the Clubhouse Model on a variety of novel outcomes. While more research is needed, the articles in this special issue reflect the growth and diversity of the evidence base for the Clubhouse Model.
