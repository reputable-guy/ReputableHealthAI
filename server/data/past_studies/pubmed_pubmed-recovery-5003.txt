Study Title: Inhibitory effect of low-dose esketamine on cough induced by sufentanil during the induction of anesthesia and postoperative impact on mental health status: a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Intravenous administration of sufentanil during anesthesia induction induces cough (SIC), sometimes triggers a severe reaction. We wanted to investigate the inhibitory effect of low-dose esketamine on cough induced by sufentanil during the induction of general anesthesia, as well as its postoperative impact on mental status (MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A). A total of 256 adult patients were randomly allocated to receive either esketamine (Group EK) or normal saline (Group C). One minute before the administration of sufentanil, Group EK and Group C were injected with esketamine (0.05&#xa0;mg/kg, diluted with normal saline to 3&#xa0;ml) and normal saline (3&#xa0;ml), respectively. The primary outcomes were the incidence (the basis of the presence or absence of cough) and severity (the frequency of cough episodes) of cough within 2&#xa0;min after sufentanil injection.The secondary outcomes included hemodynamic variables (MAP, HR, and SPi), mental status (MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A) and postoperative events (time to awareness, duration of orientation recovery and degree of satisfaction with anesthesia). A total of 236 adult patients were randomized into two groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;236): Group EK (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;118) and Group C (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;118). The incidence of cough in Group EK (21.2%) was significantly lower than that in Group C (40.7%) (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The incidence rates for each grade were as follows: 9.3% and 16.9% for Grade 2, and 0% and 4.2% for Grade 3, respectively.The differences had statistical senses.The MAP and HR at T4 (during tracheal intubation) and T5 (1&#xa0;min post-intubation) were significantly lower in Group EK (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There were no significant differences in MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A, time to awareness, duration of orientation recovery or satisfaction with anesthesia. Pretreatment with low-dose esketamine can reduce the incidence and severity of cough induced by sufentanil and maintain hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction without increasing mental status (MMSE score, RSS, and VAS-A).
