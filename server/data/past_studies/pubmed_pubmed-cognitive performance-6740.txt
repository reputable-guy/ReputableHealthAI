Study Title: A single bout of hard RPE-based cycling exercise increases salivary alpha-amylase.

Study Summary:
Exercise exerts beneficial effects on cognition, in part by stimulating an arousal response that includes the release of catecholamines. Sympathetic nervous system arousal and activation of the noradrenergic system in particular may enhance cognitive performance. Measurement of salivary alpha-amylase, a non-invasive biomarker of central noradrenergic activity, is a promising avenue for characterizing the arousal-mediated effects of exercise on cognition. However, the effectiveness of high-intensity acute exercise, and the time course of sAA concentrations following exercise, has not been clearly described. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 20&#x202f;min of perceived exertion-based high-intensity cycling exercise on salivary alpha-amylase levels in healthy young adults. We utilized a repeated-measures design to examine the sAA response to cycling exercise, rest, and an emotional picture viewing task. Thirty-two participants between the ages of 18-30 viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Before and after the task, participants completed either 20&#x202f;min of seated rest or cycling exercise at an intensity corresponding to 15 ("hard") on Borg's Ratings of Perceived Exertion scale. Salivary alpha-amylase was assessed at time points immediately before and after rest, exercise, and the picture viewing task. Exercise elicited a robust increase in salivary alpha-amylase approximately six times higher than that induced by emotional picture viewing. Importantly, the observed exercise-induced increase in salivary alpha-amylase returned to a level comparable to baseline after ten minutes. These findings have meaningful implications for future work characterizing the relationship between exercise and arousal-mediated effects on cognitive performance.
