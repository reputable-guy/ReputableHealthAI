Study Title: Changes in cognitive appraisal in a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with migraine.

Study Summary:
This study is a secondary analysis evaluating changes in cognitive fusion and pain catastrophizing over 8&#x2009;weeks of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for migraine (MBCT-M) intervention versus waitlist/treatment as usual. Migraine is a common disabling neurological condition. MBCT-M combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness-based approaches and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine-related disability. A total of 60 adults with migraine completed a 30-day run-in before randomization into a parallel design of either eight weekly individual MBCT-M sessions (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) or waitlist/treatment as usual (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29): participants were followed for 1&#x2009;month after. Participants completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ) at Months 0, 1, 2, and 4. The PCS scores decreased more in the MBCT-M group (mean [SD] at baseline&#x2009;=&#x2009;22.5&#x2009;[9.6]; at Month 4&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.1&#x2009;[8.8]) than in the waitlist/treatment as usual group (mean [SD] at baseline&#x2009;=&#x2009;24.9&#x2009;[9.0]; at Month 4&#x2009;=&#x2009;22.5&#x2009;[10.4]) from Month 0 to 4 (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-7.24, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.39 to -3.09). The CFQ (mean [SD] baseline&#x2009;=&#x2009;27.6&#x2009;[8.0]; at Month 4&#x2009;=&#x2009;25.0&#x2009;[8.0]) did not change significantly from Month 0 to 4 (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.482, 95% CI -4.5 to 2.1). Parallel mediation analyses indicated that decreases in the PCS and CFQ together (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-6.1, SE&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.5, 95% CI -11.6 to -1.8), and the PCS alone (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.8, SE&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.04, 95% CI -9.1 to -1.1), mediated changes in headache disability in the MBCT-M treatment completer group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19). In this study, pain catastrophizing showed strong promise as a potential mechanism of MBCT-M. Future research should continue to explore cognitive appraisal changes in mindfulness-based interventions.
