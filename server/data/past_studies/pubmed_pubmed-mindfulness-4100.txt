Study Title: Athletes with meditation experience counteract the detrimental effect of mental fatigue on endurance performance and neurocognitive functions.

Study Summary:
The current study examined whether meditation experience is associated with changes in endurance performance and inhibitory control-relevant neurocognitive functions caused by mental fatigue. Twenty-four athletes with meditation experience (AME) and twenty-five athletes without meditation experience (AWME) underwent a 30-min incongruent Stroop test in mental fatigue condition (MF) and a 30-min congruent Stroop test in control condition (CON) in a randomised-counterbalanced order. Inhibitory control-relevant neurocognitive functions were assessed using Flanker task and event-related potentials, followed by an endurance task using the Bruce treadmill protocol. Visual analogue scale was used to evaluate perceived mental fatigue (VAS-MF) before (T1), after Stroop test (T2) and after Flanker task (T3), and VAS for motivation (VAS-M) was used to evaluate motivation in Flanker task and endurance task. Results indicated that, compared to the CON, AWME in the MF exhibited overall lower accuracy, smaller incongruent N2 amplitude of the Flanker task (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05), and shorter time to exhaustion (TTE) of the endurance task (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), whereas AME did not exhibited difference in these outcomes between the conditions. Along with athletes in the MF reported lower VAS-M in endurance task. These findings suggest the benefits of meditation experience in mitigating the negative effects of mental fatigue.
