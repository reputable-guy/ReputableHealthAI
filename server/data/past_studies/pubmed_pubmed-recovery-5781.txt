Study Title: PS23 increases ghrelin levels and modulates microbiota composition: aanalysis of a randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Muscle damage can occur due to excessive, high-intensity, or inappropriate exercise. It is crucial for athletes and sports enthusiasts to have access to ways that expedite their recovery and alleviate discomfort. Our previous clinical trial demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and muscle damage-ameliorating properties ofPS23 (PS23), prompting us to further explore the role of this probiotic in muscle damage recovery. Thisanalysis of a randomized controlled study investigated potential mediators between the intake of PS23 and the prevention of strength loss after muscle damage. We recruited 105 students from a sports university who had participated in the previously published clinical trial. These participants were randomly allocated to three groups, receiving capsuled live PS23 (L-PS23), heat-treated PS23 (HT-PS23), or a placebo over a period of six weeks. Baseline and endpoint measurements were taken for the levels of circulating ghrelin and other blood markers, stress, mood, quality of life, and the fecal microbiota. A significant increase in ghrelin levels was recorded in the L-PS23 group compared to the other groups. Additionally, both L-PS23 and HT-PS23 interventions led to positive shifts in the gut microbiota composition, particularly in elevated,, andpopulations. The abundance of these bacteria was positively correlated with exercise performance and inversely correlated with inflammatory markers. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with PS23 may enhance exercise performance and influence muscle damage by increasing ghrelin levels and modulating the gut microbiota composition. Further clarification of the possible mechanisms and clinical implications is required.
