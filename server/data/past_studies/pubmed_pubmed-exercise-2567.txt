Study Title: Home-based exercise prehabilitation to improve disease-free survival and return to intended oncologic treatment after cancer surgery in older adults with frailty: a secondary analysis of a randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Improving survivorship for patients with cancer and frailty is a priority. We aimed to estimate whether exercise prehabilitation improves disease-free survival and return to intended oncologic treatment for older adults with frailty undergoing cancer surgery. We conducted a secondary analysis of the oncologic outcomes of a randomized trial of patients&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;60&#xa0;yr of age with frailty undergoing elective cancer surgery. Participants were randomized either to a supported, home-based exercise program plus nutritional guidance or to usual care. Outcomes for this analysis were one-year disease-free survival and return to intended oncologic treatment. We estimated complier average causal effects to account for intervention adherence. We randomized 204 participants (102 per arm); 182 were included in our modified intention-to-treat population and, of these participants, 171/182 (94%) had complete one-year follow up. In the prehabilitation group, 18/94 (11%) died or experienced cancer recurrence, compared with 19/88 (11%) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 2.34; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.49). Return to intended oncologic treatment occurred in 24/94 (29%) patients the prehabilitation group vs 20/88 (23%) in the usual care group (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.84 to 2.77; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.16). Complier average causal effects directionally diverged for disease-free survival (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.20 to 4.08; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90) and increased the point estimate for return to treatment (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 0.52 to 7.97; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.30), but in both cases the CIs included 1. Randomization to home-based exercise prehabilitation did not lead to significantly better disease-free survival or earlier return to intended oncologic treatment in older adults with frailty undergoing cancer surgery. Our results could inform future trials powered for more plausible effect sizes, especially for the return to intended oncologic treatment outcome.
