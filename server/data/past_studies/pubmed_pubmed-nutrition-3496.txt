Study Title: Acute Beetroot Juice Supplementation Has No Effect on Upper- and Lower-Body Maximal Isokinetic Strength and Muscular Endurance in International-Level Male Gymnasts.

Study Summary:
Nitrate (NO3-) has properties that can improve muscle function, leading to improvements in metabolic cost of exercise as well as enhance force production. Gymnastics is a whole-body sport, involving events that demand a high level of strength and fatigue resistance. However, the effect of NO3- supplementation on both upper- and lower-body function in gymnasts is unknown. This study examined the effect of acute beetroot juice (BRJ) supplementation on isokinetic strength and endurance of the upper- and lower-body in highly trained international-level male gymnasts. In a double-blind, randomized crossover design, 10 international-level male gymnasts completed two acute supplementation periods, consuming either 2 &#xd7; 70&#xa0;ml NO3--rich (&#x223c;12.8&#xa0;mmol/L of NO3-) or NO3--depleted (PLA) BRJ. Maximal strength of the upper-leg and upper-arm at 60&#xb0;/s, 120&#xb0;/s, 180&#xb0;/s, and 300&#xb0;/s, and muscular endurance (50 repeated isokinetic contractions at 180&#xb0;/s) were assessed. Plasma NO3- (BRJ: 663 &#xb1; 164&#xa0;&#x3bc;M, PLA: 89 &#xb1; 48&#xa0;&#x3bc;M) and nitrite (NO2-) concentrations (BRJ: 410 &#xb1; 137&#xa0;nmol/L, PLA: 125 &#xb1; 36&#xa0;nmol/L) were elevated following BRJ compared to PLA (both p < .001). Maximal strength of knee and elbow extensors and flexors did not differ between supplements (p > .05 for all velocities). Similarly, fatigue index of knee and elbow extension and flexion was not different between supplements (all p > .05). Acute BRJ supplementation, containing &#x223c;12.8&#xa0;mmol/L of NO3-, increased plasma NO3- and NO2- concentrations, but did not enhance isokinetic strength or fatigue resistance of either upper or lower extremities in international-level male gymnasts.
