Study Title: Effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention for older adults to improve emotional well-being and cognitive function in a Chinese population: A randomized waitlist-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of a modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (mMBSR) program on mental well-being and cognitive function of older adults. Two hundred and fourty-six participants were randomly assigned to mMBSR (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;120) group or waitlist control group which received mMBSR at 2-month (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;123). Data collected at baseline, 2 and 4&#xa0;months after recruitment. mental well-being: Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS). Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), international shopping list test, self-compassion scale, peace of mind scale, geriatric depression scale (GDS), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). In modified-intention-to-treat analysis, paired t-test for within group comparison, and ANCOVA to compare group differences at 2-months with adjustment of baseline values. Most participants were female (83.7%), living with others (67.0%), and married (50.7%). No significant difference of baseline characteristics except sleep quality. At 2&#xa0;months, intervention group reported better mental well-being (0.9, 95%CI: 0.1-1.8, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025) and less depressive symptoms (-1.0; 95%CI: -1.7 to&#xa0;-0.3, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004). Within group at 2&#xa0;months, intervention group had improvement in: mental well-being (SWEMWBS: 22.5-23.4, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011), cognitive function (MOCA: 24.6-25.8, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; VFT: 38.7-42.1, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), depressive symptoms (GDS: 4.1-3.1, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), and sleep quality (PSQI: 8.3-6.7, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). All these changes, except mental well-being, were sustained at 4&#xa0;months. Attrition rate was 14% and mindfulness intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable in older adults. Major limitation of the study was the absence of an active control group to control for non-specific effect.
