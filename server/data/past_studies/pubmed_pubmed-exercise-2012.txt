Study Title: Effects of the active break intervention on nonspecific low back pain among young people: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Every end-range position maintained for a prolonged time causes a static load on the spine and may lead to musculoskeletal discomfort. Prolonged flexed sitting is a strong predictor of low back pain (LBP). The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Active Break program, implemented among young people, in reducing perceived low back pain and discomfort, as well as associated disability level resulting from prolonged sitting. A randomized controlled trial was conducted among young people with non-specific LBP. Participants were randomized into groups: an experimental group participating in the tested Active Break intervention (AB-group, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25), and a control group (C-group, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) with self-administered care recommendations. The program took 12 weeks. The outcomes were average pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), disability (Oswestry Disability Index, ODI), perceived low back discomfort (LBD) during prolonged sitting (Borg scale), and global perceived improvement (Global Perceived Effect, GPE). VAS, ODI, and LBD scores after the 12-week intervention were significantly lower than those at baseline in the AB-group. In the C-group, differences were not statistically significant. Post-intervention inter-group VAS, LBD, and GPE differences were significant. The 12-week study of the Active Break intervention for young people with non-specific low back pain demonstrated significant improvement. Our research offers valuable evidence-based practices for managing and preventing low back pain, benefiting individuals, educators, healthcare professionals, personal trainers, and family physicians. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT05810519], registration date: 31/03/2023.
