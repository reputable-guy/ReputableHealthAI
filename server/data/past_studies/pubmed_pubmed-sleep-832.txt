Study Title: Sleep Quality in Individuals with and without Persistent Postpartum Hypertension.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to compare sleep quality at 1 year postpartum following a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) among individuals with persistent postpartum hypertension (HTN) compared with those with normal blood pressures (BPs). We combined data from the Heart Health 4 New Moms pilot randomized trial (&#x2009;=&#x2009;118) and the Pathways prospective cohort study (&#x2009;=&#x2009;36). Individuals with a singleton pregnancy complicated by gestational HTN or preeclampsia underwent a research study visit at a mean 48.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.5 weeks postpartum with standardized BP measurement and assessment of subjective sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Persistent postpartum HTN was defined as Stage 1 HTN or greater (mean systolic BP&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;130&#x2009;mm Hg or mean diastolic BP&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;80&#x2009;mm Hg over three measurements at rest) or requiring antihypertensive medication. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of 154 individuals with an HDP included in the analysis, 84 (55%) were normotensive at 1 year postpartum and 70 (45%) had persistent postpartum HTN. Individuals with persistent postpartum HTN were more likely to be older, self-identify as Black race, have higher prepregnancy and 1-year postpartum body mass index (BMI), be multiparous, and deliver at an earlier gestational age. The mean global PSQI score was 8.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.7, with 81% reporting poor sleep (PSQI&#x2009;>&#x2009;5), and scores were higher among individuals who were persistently hypertensive (9.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.5) compared with those who were normotensive at 1 year postpartum (7.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.6),&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01. Findings were unchanged in a multivariable model adjusting for age, self-reported race, prepregnancy BMI, and parity. Following an HDP, individuals reported poor sleep quality at 1 year postpartum. Individuals with persistent postpartum HTN reported lower sleep quality, suggesting that sleep behavior may be a target for intervention to improve maternal cardiovascular health following an HDP. &#xb7; After an HDP, poor sleep quality was common at 1 year postpartum.. &#xb7; Those with persistent postpartum HTN reported worse sleep quality at 1 year postpartum.. &#xb7; Sleep behavior may be a target for intervention to improve maternal cardiovascular health..
