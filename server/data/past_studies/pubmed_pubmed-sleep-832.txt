Study Title: DAHOS Study: Efficacy of dapagliflozin in treating heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome - A 3-month, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The recent discovery of new therapeutic approaches to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, as well as improved treatment of co-morbidities has provided much needed help to HFrEF. In addition, dapagliflozin, one of the SGLT-2 inhibitors, serves as a promising candidate in treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) of HFrEF patients due to its likely mechanism of countering the pathophysiology of OSA of HFrEF. This 3-month multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial enrolled participants with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 15. Participants were randomized into two groups: the treatment group received optimized heart failure treatment and standard-dose dapagliflozin, while the control group only received optimized heart failure treatment. The primary endpoint was the difference in AHI before and after treatment between the two groups. Secondary endpoints included oxygen desaturation index (ODI), minimum oxygen saturation, longest apnea duration, inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6), quality of life score, and LVEF. A total of 107 patients were included in the final analysis. AHI, LVEF and other baseline data were similar for the dapagliflozin and control groups. After 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, the dapagliflozin group showed significant improvements in sleep parameters including AHI, HI, longest pause time, ODI, time spent with SpO&#x2009;<&#x2009;90%, and average SpO. Meanwhile, the control group showed no significant changes in sleep parameters, but did demonstrate significant improvements in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, LVEF, and NT-proBNP levels at 12 weeks. In the experimental group, BMI was significantly reduced, and there were improvements in ESS score, MLHFQ score, and EQ-5D-3L score, as well as significant reductions in CRP and IL-6 levels, while the CRP and IL-6 levels were not improved in the control group. The decrease in LVEF was more significant in the experimental group compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in the magnitude of the decreases between the two groups. Dapagliflozin may be an effective treatment for heart failure complicated with OSA, and could be considered as a potential new treatment for OSA.
