Study Title: Colorectal cancer screening: results from the World Trade Center Health Registry cohort.

Study Summary:
Little is known about colorectal cancer screening in 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC)-exposed populations. We utilized survey data from the WTC Health Registry (WTCHR) to examine associations between enrollees' characteristics and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We studied 22,061 enrollees aged 50-75 who completed the WTCHR follow-up survey in 2015-2016. Those with a history of CRC were excluded. Screening was defined as a self-reported, routine colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy during the 12-month period prior to the survey. Multivariable log binomial regression identified factors associated with screening in the 12&#xa0;months preceding the survey. We also&#xa0;stratified by age group. Of 22,061 enrollees, 23% were screened, with largely similar rates across age groups. Higher screening percentages were seen in selected groups including non-Hispanic Black enrollees (26.4%), males (24.3%), those married/living with a partner (24.1%), those with a higher household income (&#x2265;&#x2009;$150&#xa0;k, 25.4%), those who received services from the WTC Health Program (25.6%), and those with greater perceived social support (24.4%). On multivariable analyses, non-Hispanic Black enrollees [adjusted relative risk (aRR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.42] were significantly more likely to report screening, even after stratifying by age group. Hispanic enrollees, those with a higher household income, those with increased perceived social support, and those with diagnosed medical conditions under 70&#xa0;years old were also associated with screening. We found that non-Hispanic Black compared with non-Hispanic White enrollees were more likely to obtain screening for CRC. Continued efforts to promote health and wellness of WTC-exposed population is essential.
