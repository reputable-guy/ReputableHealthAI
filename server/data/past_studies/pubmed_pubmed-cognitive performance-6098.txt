Study Title: Effects of esketamine on postoperative negative emotions and early cognitive disorders in patients undergoing non-cardiac thoracic surgery: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate whether a single dosage of esketamine injection in the anesthesia period could improve postoperative negative emotions and early cognitive function in patients undergoing non-cardiac thoracic surgery. A prospective single center double blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. Perioperative period; operating room, post anesthesia care unit and hospital ward. 129 adult patients that underwent elective non-cardiac thoracic surgery under general anesthesia. During the operation, pharmacologic prevention of postoperative negative emotion and early cognitive disorder with 0.2&#xa0;mg/kg (Low esketamine group) and 0.5&#xa0;mg/kg esketamine (High esketamine group) vs. placebo. Emotion and early cognitive performance were assessed on the day before surgery (POD-1), postoperative day 1 (POD1) and day 3 (POD3) using HADS-A, HADS-D, Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and serum biomarkers (S100&#x3b2;, BDNF, IL-6, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine). The high esketamine group showed significantly lower HADS-A and HADS-D scores than control group on POD1 and POD3. No significant differences were observed between the low esketamine group and the control group. The esketamine-treated groups showed lower pain VAS scores than the control group at 2&#xa0;h and on the first day after operation. There were no significant differences among the three groups in CAM and MMSE scores. However, the high esketamine group had lower S100&#x3b2; and IL-6 levels, and higher BDNF levels postoperatively, while serum acetylcholine and norepinephrine were not significantly different. A single intraoperative injection of 0.5&#xa0;mg/kg esketamine can alleviate postoperative anxiety, depression, and pain to some extent. Although cognitive function behavioral evaluation did not show obvious benefits, it can also reduce the production of pro-inflammatory and brain injury-related factors while promoting the generation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
