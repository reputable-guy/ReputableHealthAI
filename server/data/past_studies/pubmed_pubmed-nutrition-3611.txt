Study Title: A Systematic Approach to Evidence-Based Design for Measurable Health and Wellness Outcomes: Curating and Translating Evidence to Practice.

Study Summary:
Evaluating evidence from peer-review literature for use in evidence-based design is often challenging for the design disciplines, requiring access to the peer-reviewed literature, expertise in evaluating methods and findings, and translating the results into actionable design and operational recommendations. The purpose of this methods paper is to elucidate the process for systematic evaluation of research to translate evidence into practical application to improve design for occupant health and wellness. Researchers have found strong connections in environmental design influence on health and wellness that have proven to be substantiative in the effort to improve health and well-being. Design has the capacity to encourage healthy choices and decisions within the built environment. Translation of evidence into applied design solutions may improve public health. A protocol is presented that culminates in the translation of evidence into design recommendations focused on improving occupant health. The protocol includes preparation for the literature search and review, search strategy, study selection, data analysis, and development of the literature review. After evaluation of the evidence is completed, there were several positive findings in the example that stakeholders could utilize to improve the health of building occupants with programs and design to support nutrition, physical activity, and circadian entrainment. There are a variety of software tools and processes to utilize in the curation of evidence to improve the built environment with relevant design recommendations and operational considerations affecting the personal, social, and economic health of our society.
