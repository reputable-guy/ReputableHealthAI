Study Title: Effects of a diverse prebiotic fibre blend on inflammation, the gut microbiota and affective symptoms in metabolic syndrome: a pilot open-label randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Emerging evidence suggests that low-grade systemic inflammation plays a key role in altering brain activity, behaviour and affect. Modulation of the gut microbiota using prebiotic fibre offers a potential therapeutic tool to regulate inflammation, mediated via the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). However, the impact of prebiotic consumption on affective symptoms and the possible contribution from inflammation, gut symptoms and the gut microbiome are currently underexamined. In this 12-week study, the effects of a diverse prebiotic blend on inflammation, gut microbiota profiles and affective symptoms in a population with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were examined. Sixty males and females with MetS meeting the criteria for MetS were randomised into a treatment group (40), receiving 10 g per day of a diverse prebiotic blend and healthy eating advice, and a control group (20), receiving healthy eating advice only. Our results showed a significant reduction in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the treatment (-0&#xb7;58 [-9&#xb7;96 to-2&#xb7;63]) compared with control (0&#xb7;37 [-3&#xb7;64 to-3&#xb7;32]), alongside significant improvements in self-reported affective scores in the treatment compared with the control group. While there were no differences in relative abundance between groups at week 12, there was a significant increase from baseline to week 12 in fecalandin the treatment group, both of which are recognised as SCFA producers. Multivariate regression analyses further revealed an association between gastrointestinal symptoms and hs-CRP with affective scores. Together, this study provides preliminary support for a diverse prebiotic blend for mood, stress and anxiety.
