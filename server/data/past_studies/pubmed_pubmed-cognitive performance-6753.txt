Study Title: Homocysteine Status Modifies the Treatment Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Cognition in a Randomized Clinical Trial in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease: The OmegAD Study.

Study Summary:
Trials of supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (&#x3c9;3-FAs) in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) have produced inconsistent effects on cognitive decline. There is evidence of an interaction between B vitamin status and &#x3c9;3-FAs in relation to brain atrophy and cognitive decline. We investigated whether baseline levels of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), a marker of B vitamin status, modify the effects of &#x3c9;3-FAs supplementation on cognitive performance in moderate AD. This post hoc analysis of the OmegAD trial included 171 community-based patients with AD (MMSE&#x2265;15): 88 patients received daily doses of 1.7&#x200a;g docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6&#x200a;g eicosapentaenoic acid for 6 months. Treatment outcome on cognition was analyzed according to baseline levels of tHcy using a general linear model and ANCOVA. We found significant interactions between &#x3c9;3-FA supplementation and tHcy on cognition and clinical stage assessed by MMSE (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.040), global CDR (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.059), and CDRsob (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.023), but not on ADAS-cog (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.649). In patients with tHcy levels <11.7&#x3bc;mol/L, &#x3c9;3-FA supplementation improved cognitive performance as measured by MMSE (+7.1%, 95% CI: 0.59 to 13.7%, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.033) and clinical status as measured by CDRsob (-22.3%, 95% CI: -5.8 to -38.7%, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.009) compared with placebo. The effect of &#x3c9;3-FA supplementation on MMSE and CDR appears to be influenced by baseline tHcy, suggesting that adequate B vitamin status is required to obtain beneficial effects of &#x3c9;3-FA on cognition.
