Study Title: Trauma exposure across the lifespan among individuals engaged in treatment with medication for opioid use disorder: differences by gender, PTSD status, and chronic pain.

Study Summary:
There is&#xa0;little study of lifetime trauma exposure among individuals engaged in medication treatment&#xa0;for opioid use disorder (MOUD).&#xa0;A multisite study provided the opportunity to examine the prevalence of lifetime trauma and differences by gender, PTSD status, and chronic pain. A cross-sectional study examined baseline data from participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;303) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a mind-body intervention as an adjunct to MOUD. All participants were stabilized on MOUD. Measures included the Trauma Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5). Analyses involved descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, and linear and logistic regression. Participants were self-identified as women (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;157), men (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;144), and non-binary (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2). Fifty-seven percent (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;172) self-reported chronic pain, and 41% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;124) scored above the screening cut-off for PTSD. Women reported significantly more intimate partner violence (85%) vs 73%) and adult sexual assault (57% vs 13%), while men reported more physical assault (81% vs 61%) and witnessing trauma (66% vs 48%). Men and women experienced substantial childhood physical abuse, witnessed intimate partner violence as children, and reported an equivalent exposure to accidents as adults. The number of traumatic events predicted PTSD symptom severity and PTSD diagnostic status. Participants with chronic pain, compared to those without chronic pain, had significantly more traumatic events in childhood (85% vs 75%). The study found a high prevalence of lifetime trauma among people in MOUD. Results highlight the need for comprehensive assessment and mental health services to address trauma among those in MOUD treatment. NCT04082637.
