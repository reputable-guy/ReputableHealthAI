Study Title: Efficacy and safety of yangxinshi versus trimetazidine on exercise tolerance in patients with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention: Multicenter, double-blind clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Optimizing medication to improve exercise tolerance in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is limited. Yangxinshi tablets, an herbal-based oral medicine, relieve symptoms of angina might be that they can improve energy metabolism of the ischemic myocardium. We conducted a randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Yangxinshi vs. trimetazidine in improving exercise tolerance in patients with CHD after PCI. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, non-inferiority study enrolled patients aged 18-75 years with CHD who underwent their first PCI within 2 months of diagnosis. Patients were randomized to Yangxinshi plus trimetazidine-placebo or trimetazidine plus Yangxinshi-placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in metabolic equivalents (METs) assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) between 0 and 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were comprehensive variables of the CPET, health status and adverse events. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT03809273). Between August 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022, a total of 681 patients were randomized to Yangxinshi (n = 341) or trimetazidine (n = 340). After 24 weeks, the exercise tolerance of patients increased by 0.77&#xb1;1.25 METs in the Yangxinshi group and 0.76&#xb1;1.00 METs in the trimetazidine group (difference, 0.01; 95 % confidence interval [CI], -0.17 to 0.19), meeting the predefined non-inferiority threshold. Better outcomes were observed in the Yangxinshi group compared with the trimetazidine group for patient-reported depression (PHQ-9; -1.88&#xb1;3.32 vs. -0.93&#xb1;3.68; p < 0.001) and anxiety (GAD-7; -1.70&#xb1;3.26 vs. -0.39&#xb1;3.29; p < 0.001). Adverse events were similar in both groups. In patients with CHD after PCI, Yangxinshi was non-inferior to trimetazidine in improving exercise tolerance during the 24-week treatment period. Notably, patients in the Yangxinshi group showed a better mental health profile compared with trimetazidine recipients.
