Study Title: The impact of integrated health Qigong and dance exercise on cardiovascular function in middle-aged and elderly women.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of health Qigong on vascular elasticity, blood lipid levels, and cardiac function in middle-aged and elderly women. By comparing various indicators preintervention and postintervention, the research provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of health Qigong in enhancing cardiovascular health within this demographic. A total of 40 middle-aged and elderly women were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The experimental group, consisting of 20 women, practiced health Qigong combined with Tibetan dance for 12 weeks, 3 times per week, with each session lasting 60 minutes. The control group, also consisting of 20 women, continued their regular routines without any exercise intervention. Cardiovascular function metrics were subsequently compared between the 2 groups. (1) Pulse wave velocity: in the experimental group, significant improvements were observed, particularly in the right ankle (P =.02 for left ankle, P =.00 for right ankle). The control group showed no significant differences (P =.08 for both ankles); (2) blood lipid levels: the experimental group demonstrated significant reductions in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels (P =.00 for both), while the control group showed no significant changes (P =.59 for total cholesterol, P =.71 for triglycerides). There were significant differences in high-density lipoprotein levels between the experimental and control groups (P =.00 and .01, respectively); (3) cardiac function: significant improvements were noted in cardiac output (Teich) and stroke volume (Teich) in the experimental group (P =.00 for both), while the control group showed no significant differences (P =.71 for cardiac output, P =.06 for stroke volume). Health Qigong, integrated with dance exercise effectively enhances pulse wave velocity, blood lipid levels, and cardiac function in middle-aged and elderly women. These findings suggest that incorporating such exercises may contribute to the prevention or delay of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in this population.
