Study Title: Effect of multidisciplinary team-style continuity of care and nutritional nursing on lung cancer: randomized study.

Study Summary:
The clinical efficacy of systemic chemotherapy is limited due to the nonspecific delivery of anticancer drugs and is associated with serious systemic adverse effects. Therefore, integrated treatment and comprehensive care are particularly important for postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer.This study aimed to ascertain the application effect of multidisciplinary team (MDT)-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional nursing in postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer. Nutritional indices, immune function, adverse emotions, self-efficacy, self-care ability, quality of life and toxic reactions during chemotherapy were recorded in postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer receiving routine care (control group) and MDT-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional care (intervention group).After care, the intervention group performed higher BMI, PA, TP and ALB, CD3, CD4and CD4/CD8, lower levels of CD8, lower self-rating anxiety scale, self-rating depression scale and QLQ-C30 symptom domain scores and higher general self-efficacy scale, exercise of self-care agency scale and QLQ-C30 functional domain scores versus the control group (all&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05).MDT-style continuity of care combined with whole-process nutritional care can improve the nutritional status of postoperative chemotherapy patients with lung cancer, and in turn enhance their quality of life.
