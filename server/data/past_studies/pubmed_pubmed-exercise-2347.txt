Study Title: The Physiological and Performance Effects of Actovegin during Maximal Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Evidence regarding the performance-related effects of Actovegin is limited, despite legislated restrictions being in place for this supplement within sport settings. Our study examined the effects of Actovegin on physiological responses and performance during maximal cardiopulmonary exercise in collegiate athletes. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design was adopted. Moderately trained collegiate athletes from various sports were randomly allocated to placebo (= 8) or Actovegin (= 8) groups. All athletes consumed three capsules across each day for seven days of loading. Athletes underwent two separate cardiopulmonary exercise tests one week apart. Separate 2 &#xd7; 2 mixed ANOVAs and effect sizes (&#x3b7;p2) were used to assess for between- and within-group differences. A significant time * group effect (= 0.036, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.278) was observed in systolic blood pressure. Significant main effects were only observed for time in several variables, with increases in peak oxygen uptake (VO) (< 0.001, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.893), peak minute ventilation (= 0.004, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.456), ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide (= 0.002, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.517), oxygen pulse (= 0.006, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.434), VOat first ventilatory threshold (= 0.002, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.520), velocity at second ventilatory threshold (< 0.001, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.997), VOat second ventilatory threshold (< 0.001, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.628), and peak velocity (= 0.010, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.386), and a decrease in respiratory exchange ratio (< 0.001, &#x3b7;p2 = 0.695). Our findings suggest that although physiological and performance alterations were evident with Actovegin supplementation during cardiopulmonary exercise, no further benefits beyond those obtained with a placebo were attained.
