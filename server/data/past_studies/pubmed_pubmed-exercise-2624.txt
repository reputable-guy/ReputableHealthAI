Study Title: Effect of lower limb resistance exercise with abdominal draw-in on stroke survivors: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
Evidence-based guidelines are needed to inform rehabilitation practice including the effect of non-paralytic lower limb resistance exercise with abdominal drawing-in technique (ADIM) on recovery of trunk control, balance and daily living after stroke survivors. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of trunk control strengthening performed in non-paralytic lower limb resistance exercise with ADIM on trunk control, balance, daily living in stroke survivors. The 24 participants with stroke were randomly divided into three groups: lower limb resistance exercise group (LRAG; n&#x200a;=&#x200a;8), lower limb exercise group (LAG; n&#x200a;=&#x200a;8), and control group (CG; n&#x200a;=&#x200a;8). The training sessions were conducted three times a week for four weeks. Outcome measures included the Korean version Trunk Impairment Scale (K-TIS), Postural Assessment Scale of Stroke (PASS), Modified Functional Reach Test (mFRT), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Foot print and Modified Barthel's Index (MBI). The results showed that the LRAG had a significant effect on the K-TIS, PASS, mFRT, Foot print and MBI than the LAG and CG (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05). The BBS results showed a significant difference the CG (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05). This study showed that repeated non-paralytic lower limb resistance exercises with ADIM can be used clinically as a training method for general physiotherapy in patients with reduced postural control, balance and daily living.
