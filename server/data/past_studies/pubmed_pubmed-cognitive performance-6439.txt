Study Title: Money talks: The influence of extrinsic motivators on social cognition in early episode psychosis.

Study Summary:
Amotivation is a central feature of psychosis that can lead to underperformance on a variety of tasks, including neurocognitive testing; however, there is some evidence that neurocognitive impairments resulting from low effort can be ameliorated with the use of monetary reinforcement. While cross-sectional data has also shown that amotivation is associated with social cognitive performance, limited research has examined the directionality of this relationship, and whether monetary reinforcement can similarly reduce these impairments. In the present study, 35 patients with early psychosis and 35 community controls were randomized to either a reward condition in which they received monetary reinforcement for every correct response on a theory of mind (ToM) task, or a non-reward condition in which no feedback was provided. A significant group by condition interaction emerged after adjusting for premorbid intelligence and global neurocognition, F(1, 63)&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.76, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.007. Post-hoc analyses revealed that performance on the ToM task was similar across conditions for controls, whereas early psychosis patients in the reward condition had clinically and statistically significant differences in ToM performance compared to patients in the non-reward condition. These results suggest that social cognitive task performance may underrepresent actual ability in the early stages of psychosis. Future research is needed to discriminate the relative effects of monetary reinforcement, corrective feedback, and/or a combination of these factors to better understand performance differences between conditions, which appeared to be unique to early psychosis patients.
