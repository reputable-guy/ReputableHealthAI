Study Title: Open Trial of a Brief Imagery-Based Stabilization Psychotherapy for Adults with Acute Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

Study Summary:
Early intervention after trauma is needed for reduction in clinical distress and prevention of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study describes findings from an open pilot trial of a brief stabilization psychotherapy based on imagery techniques for adults with acute PTSD (i.e., within 3 months of onset). Four sessions of 60-minute individual psychotherapy were conducted on 18 participants with PTSD within 3 months after accidents, 15 of whom completed the treatment. The clinician-administered PTSD scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales, and self-questionnaires were administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Eight (53.3%) of the 15 patients at post-treatment and 8 of the 9 patients at 6-month follow-up did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Reliable change of PTSD symptoms after treatment was observed in 6 of 15 (45.0%) patients at post-treatment and in 4 of 9 (45.0%) patients after 6 months. There was a significant decrease in PTSD, depression, anxiety, and impaired quality of life scores after treatment, and these gains were maintained after 6 months. No cases of exacerbated PTSD symptoms were observed among completers and non-completers. Our findings suggest that brief stabilization sessions are safe treatment options for acute PTSD (KCT0001918).
