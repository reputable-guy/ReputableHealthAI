Study Title: The Effect of Foot Reflexology on Stress, Fatigue, and Low Back Pain in Intensive Care Unit Nurses: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study, which uses a randomized controlled design, aimed to determine the effect of foot reflexology on stress, fatigue, and low back pain (LBP) in intensive care unit (ICU) nurses. The study was conducted with intensive care unit nurses at two hospitals in a city between September 2022 and April 2023. The study sample consisted of 42 nurses, 21 of whom had low back pain for at least 3 months and 21 of whom were controls. In the study, foot reflexology was applied to the intervention group for 20 minutes (10 minutes on each foot) once a week for 4 weeks. There was no intervention applied to the control group. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Based on the change in the mean scores of the scale in the intervention and control groups over time, a statistically significant decrease was found between the pre-test (before foot reflexology) and post-test mean scores of the LBP-VAS (from 6.33 to 2.24, respectively) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (from 4.81 to 3.60, respectively) in the intervention group. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the perceived stress scale pre-test and post-test scores, it was found that there was a decrease in favor of the intervention group. Foot reflexology appears to offer promise as an effective method for ICU nurses to reduce lower back pain and fatigue.
