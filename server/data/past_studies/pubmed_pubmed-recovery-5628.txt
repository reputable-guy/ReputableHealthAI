Study Title: Effect of esketamine on haemodynamic fluctuations in patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery: A prospective, double-blind randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
We explored whether esketamine anesthesia during hysteroscopic surgery can reduce intraoperative hemodynamic fluctuations and improve patient benefit. A total of 170 patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery were enrolled, and 151 patients were finally included in the analysis, among which 19 used vasoactive drugs during surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to either the esketamine anesthesia group (E group) or the sufentanil anesthesia group (S group). The primary outcomes were blood pressure and heart rate during the surgery. Secondary outcomes included resistance to laryngeal mask insertion, demand for propofol and remifentanil, nausea and vomiting, Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS), dizziness and pain intensity after resuscitation, vasoactive medication treatment, hospitalization time and expenses. E group had a more stable heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure than the S group (p < 0.001). Patients in E group had a higher demand for propofol (p < 0.001) but better RASS scores (p < 0.001) after resuscitation. The incidence of intraoperative vasoactive medication use was higher in the S group (18.4% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.029). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of resistance to laryngeal mask insertion, remifentanil demand, time required for resuscitation, postoperative pain, dizziness, nausea or vomiting. Compared with sufentanil, esketamine-induced anesthesia during hysteroscopic surgery can reduce intraoperative hemodynamic fluctuations and the incidence of intraoperative vasoactive medication. Although esketamine-induced anesthesia may increase the demand for propofol during surgery, it does not affect the anesthesia recovery time and the quality of patient recovery is better.
