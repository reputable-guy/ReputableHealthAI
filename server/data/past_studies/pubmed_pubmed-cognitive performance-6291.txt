Study Title: Cognitive effects of guarana supplementation with maximal intensity cycling.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of guarana supplementation on cognitive performance before and after a bout of maximal intensity cycling and to compare this to an equivalent caffeine dose. Twenty-five participants completed the randomised double-blind crossover trial by performing cognitive tests with one of three supplements, on three different days: guarana (125 mg/kg), caffeine (5 mg/kg) or placebo (65 mg/kg protein powder). After 30 min of rest, participants performed simple (SRT) and choice reaction time (CRT) tests, an immediate word recall test and Bond-Lader mood scale. This was followed by a cyclingOtest, and cognitive tests were then immediately repeated. Guarana supplementation decreased CRT before exercise (407 (sd 45) ms) in comparison with placebo (421 (sd 46) ms,= 0&#xb7;030) but not caffeine (417 (sd 42) ms). SRT after exercise decreased following guarana supplementation (306 (sd 28) ms) in comparison with placebo (323 (sd 32) ms,= 0&#xb7;003) but not caffeine (315 (sd 32) ms). Intra-individual variability on CRT significantly improved from before (111&#xb7;4 (sd 60&#xb7;5) ms) to after exercise (81&#xb7;85 (sd 43&#xb7;1) ms) following guarana supplementation, and no differences were observed for caffeine and placebo (> 0&#xb7;05). Alertness scores significantly improved following guarana supplementation (63&#xb7;3 (sd 13&#xb7;8)) in comparison with placebo (57&#xb7;4 (sd 13&#xb7;4),= 0&#xb7;014) but not caffeine (61&#xb7;2 (sd 12&#xb7;8)). There were no changes toO, immediate word recall or any other Bond-Lader mood scales. Guarana supplementation appears to impact several parameters of cognition. These results support the use of guarana supplementation to possibly maintain speed of attention immediately following a maximal intensity exercise test (O).
