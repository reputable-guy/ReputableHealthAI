Study Title: Effects of Naikan-Mindfulness Therapy on Psychiatric Rehabilitation for Chronic Schizophrenia.

Study Summary:
To explore the effect of Naikan mindfulness therapy on psychiatric rehabilitation for chronic schizophrenia. 100 chronic schizophrenic patients in a third-class psychiatric hospital from July 2020 to August 2021 were selected as the research object. The following criteria were adopted: a clinician clearly diagnosed chronic schizophrenia, the patient was between 18 and 65 years old, and the patient agreed to participate in the study and signed an informed consent form.The random mathematical table method divided them into the control group (50 cases treated with Naikan therapy) and the experimental group (50 cases treated with Naikan mindfulness therapy). The LSIA(Life Satisfaction Index in Schizophrenia) score, SSFPI (Social Satisfaction and Functioning in Patients with Schizophrenia)score and satisfaction of psychiatric rehabilitation nursing were compared between the two groups. In terms of LSIA score, there was no significant difference in baseline score between the two groups (P > .05). At 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention, the scores of the two groups increased, but the scores of the experimental group at 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention were higher than those of the control group, the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). In terms of SSFPI score, there was no significant difference in baseline score between the two groups (P < .05); At 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention, the scores of the two groups increased, but the scores of the experimental group at 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention were higher than those of the control group, the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). In terms of satisfaction with psychiatric rehabilitation nursing, there was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group 6 weeks after intervention (P > .05); 12 weeks after the intervention, the satisfaction scores of the two groups increased significantly, and the scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < .05). Naikan mindfulness therapy led to significant improvements in LSIA scores, SSFPI scores, and satisfaction with psychiatric rehabilitation nursing at both 6 and 12 weeks. The life satisfaction, social function, and the satisfaction of psychiatric rehabilitation nursing of the chronic schizophrenics can be improved by the combination of Naikan mindfulness therapy. This study found that by using Naikan therapy, we can improve life satisfaction, social functioning, and satisfaction with psychiatric rehabilitation care in patients with chronic schizophrenia. This has important practical implications for patient treatment and care, including improving quality of life, enhancing social integration, improving rehabilitation outcomes, and reducing the burden on medical staff. This research provides a useful method for comprehensive care of patients with schizophrenia and is expected to have a positive impact on improving patients' lives and recovery in the future.
