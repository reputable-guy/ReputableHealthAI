Study Title: The effect of exercise and educational programs for breast cancer patients on the development of breast cancer-related lymphoedema: secondary endpoint from a randomized controlled trial in the Setouchi Breast Project-10.

Study Summary:
Although the association between higher physical activity and preventive effect on breast-cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) has been reported, it is unclear what intervention is optimal. We aimed to investigate the effect of exercise and educational programs on BCRL development. This study was a secondary endpoint analysis from a prospective randomized controlled trial. We enrolled patients with stage 0-III breast cancer from March 2016 to March 2020 and randomly assigned them to the control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;111), education (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;115), or exercise (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;104) group. As secondary endpoint, we assessed the incidence of and preventive effect on BCRL at 12&#xa0;months post-intervention. There were no significant differences in the incidence of BCRL at 12&#xa0;months post-intervention between the exercise and control groups (9.8% and 10.8%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.83) and the education and control groups (11.6% and 10.8%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.00). There were no significant differences in time to BCRL onset from the day of surgery between the exercise and control groups (event rate at 12&#xa0;months: 20.7% and 17.2%, log-rank, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54) and the education and control groups (18.8% and 17.2%, log-rank, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.57). The multivariable analyses indicated that axillary dissection and obesity significantly increased the risk of BCRL [hazard ratio (HR): 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-3.67 and HR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.07-2.63, respectively]. The intervention did not decrease the risk of BCRL, and axillary dissection and obesity were the risk factors of BCRL. UMIN000020595 at UMIN Clinical Trial Registry.
