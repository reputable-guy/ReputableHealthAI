Study Title: Relevance of sleep for wellness: New trends in using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Study Summary:
Sleep and well-being have been intricately linked, and sleep hygiene is paramount for developing mental well-being and resilience. Although widespread, sleep disorders require elaborate polysomnography laboratory and patient-stay with sleep in unfamiliar environments. Current technologies have allowed various devices to diagnose sleep disorders at home. However, these devices are in various validation stages, with many already receiving approvals from competent authorities. This has captured vast patient-related physiologic data for advanced analytics using artificial intelligence through machine and deep learning applications. This is expected to be integrated with patients' Electronic Health Records and provide individualized prescriptive therapy for sleep disorders in the future.
