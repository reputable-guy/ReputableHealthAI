Study Title: Esketamine combined with a mindfulness-based intervention for individuals with alcohol problems.

Study Summary:
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health issue, posing harmful consequences for individuals and society. Recent advances in addiction research have highlighted the therapeutic potential of ketamine-assisted therapy for AUD. However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unknown. This double-blind, pilot study aimed to investigate esketamine combined with mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) to examine whether esketamine enhances engagement in MBI for individuals with alcohol misuse problems and whether enhanced engagement has any impact on alcohol-related outcomes. In all, 28 individuals with alcohol problems were randomly assigned to receive sublingual esketamine hydrochloride (AWKN002: 115.1&#x2009;mg) or vitamin C (placebo) in an oral thin film and took part in 2&#x2009;weeks of daily MBI. Participants were assessed on various self-report measures, including mindfulness, engagement in MBI (physical and psychological), alcohol cravings and consumption. Esketamine enhanced psychological engagement with a daily MBI, compared to placebo, and led to transient decreases in alcohol cravings. Esketamine also resulted in significantly greater mystical experiences and dissociative states compared to placebo. The findings suggest that esketamine may improve treatment outcomes when combined with mindfulness-based therapies through its ability to increase engagement with meditative practice.
