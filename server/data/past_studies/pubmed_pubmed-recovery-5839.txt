Study Title: Probiotic Compounds Enhanced Recovery after Surgery for Patients with Distal Gastric Cancer: A Prospective, Controlled Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) for radical distal gastrectomy needs to be improved urgently. We investigated the effects of probiotic compounds (including Lactobacillus plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp.lactis) on enhance recovery after gastrectomy. The patients in this prospective study were divided into probiotic group (PG group, n = 36) and placebo group (CG group, n = 38), taking corresponding capsule according to the protocol during the perioperative period. We compared the trends in perioperative hematologic findings and the postoperative outcomes. Patients' feces were collected for bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing. Patients were followed up at 1 month postoperatively. After the application of probiotics, the patients' postoperative inflammatory response level was reduced, and the trend of postoperative NLR decrease was significantly faster in the patients of the PG group than in the CG group (P = 0.047, partial &#x3b7;= 0.054). The trend of postoperative increase in serum albumin concentration in the patients of the PG group was significantly better than that in the CG group (P = 0.016, partial &#x3b7;= 0.078). In addition, patients in the PG group met discharge criteria earlier postoperatively and had fewer medical expenses. The quality of life of PG group was improved postoperatively. Postoperative inflammation-related markers, including the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, were increasing in untreated patients. In addition, the postoperative microbial diversity and abundance in the PG group remained stable. Probiotic compounds can reduce the inflammatory response after gastrectomy and enhance the recovery of the DGC patients by maintaining the stability of the gut microbiota.
