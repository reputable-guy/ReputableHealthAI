Study Title: Impact of digital meditation on work stress and health outcomes among adults with overweight: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness meditation may improve well-being at work; however, effects on food cravings and metabolic health are not well known. We tested effects of digital meditation, alone or in combination with a healthy eating program, on perceived stress, cravings, and adiposity. We randomized 161 participants with overweight and moderate stress to digital meditation ('MED,' n = 38), digital meditation + healthy eating ('MED+HE,' n = 40), active control ('HE,' n = 41), or waitlist control ('WL,' n = 42) for 8 weeks. Participants (n = 145; M(SD) BMI: 30.8 (5.4) kg/m2) completed baseline and 8-week measures of stress (Perceived Stress Scale), cravings (Food Acceptance and Awareness Questionnaire) and adiposity (sagittal diameter and BMI). ANCOVAs revealed that those randomized to MED or MED+HE (vs. HE or WL) showed decreases in perceived stress (F = 15.19, p < .001, &#x3b7;2 = .10) and sagittal diameter (F = 4.59, p = .03, &#x3b7;2 = .04), with no differences in cravings or BMI. Those high in binge eating who received MED or MED+HE showed decreases in sagittal diameter (p = .03). Those with greater adherence to MED or MED+HE had greater reductions in stress, cravings, and adiposity (ps < .05). A brief digital mindfulness-based program is a low-cost method for reducing perceptions of stress and improving abdominal fat distribution patterns among adults with overweight and moderate stress. Future work should seek to clarify mechanisms by which such interventions contribute to improvements in health.
