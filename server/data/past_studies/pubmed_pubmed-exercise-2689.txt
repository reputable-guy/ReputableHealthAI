Study Title: The Effects of Different Myofascial Release Techniques on Pain, Range of Motion, and Muscle Strength in Athletes With Iliotibial Band Tightness: A Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
We designed this study to investigate the effects of 2 myofascial release techniques, Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) and Foam Roller (FR), on pain, joint range of motion, and muscle strength in athletes suffering from iliotibial band (ITB) tightness. A total of 39 male soccer players were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial, aged between 18 and 23&#xa0;years who were divided into 3 groups: Only Exercise, IASTM, and FR. All participants performed daily strengthening and stretching exercises, while 1 group added IASTM, and the other added FR to the exercise program. We evaluated ITB tightness with the Ober test and an inclinometer, pressure pain threshold, using an algometer, and we evaluated muscle strength with the Cybex Norm Isokinetic device. We found that all 3 groups exhibited an increase in the Ober inclination angle after the interventions (P = .001), but the increase was greater for participants in the IASTM and FR groups, compared with exercise alone. Additionally, both the IASTM and FR groups displayed an increased pressure pain threshold (P = .001), whereas there was no change in the control group. Moreover, while all 3 groups experienced an increase in hip muscle strength (P = .001), the IASTM and FR groups exhibited a greater increase compared with exercise alone (P = .001). Based on these findings, exercise improves pain, range of motion, and muscle strength in athletes with ITB tightness, and IASTM, and FR techniques enhanced exercise effects but did not differ from one another. While our study demonstrated that both IASTM and FR techniques significantly enhance the benefits of exercise for athletes with ITB tightness, further research could delve into the long-term effects of these interventions.
