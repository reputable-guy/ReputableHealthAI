Study Title: Mass balance and pharmacokinetic characterization of&#xa0;zavegepant in healthy male subjects.

Study Summary:
Zavegepant, a high-affinity, selective, small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, is approved as a nasal spray for acute treatment of migraine in adults. This phase I, open-label, single-center, single-period, nonrandomized study in six healthy male subjects assessed mass balance recovery after a single 15-min intravenous (IV) infusion dose of carbon-14 ([C])-zavegepant. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected over 192&#x2009;h for analysis of zavegepant in plasma and urine; total radioactivity (TR) in plasma, whole blood, urine, and feces; and zavegepant metabolite profiling and structural identification in plasma, urine, and feces. An average of 96.6% of radioactivity administered was recovered in excreta. Most TR (mean 84.9%) was recovered in the feces, indicating that biliary/fecal elimination was the main route. Volume of distribution of zavegepant based on the terminal phase (129&#x2009;L) was higher than total body water (42&#x2009;L), indicating substantial distribution into tissue. Total plasma clearance of zavegepant (220&#x2009;mL/min) is identical to whole blood clearance given the blood/plasma partition ratio of 1, lower than typical hepatic blood flow (1450&#x2009;mL/min). The observed plasma terminal half-life of zavegepant was 6.8&#x2009;h. Exposure to zavegepant accounted for ~90% of circulating plasma TR, suggesting that very low levels of uncharacterized circulating metabolites were present. Metabolite profiling did not identify any metabolites representing &#x2265;10% of radioactivity in plasma, urine, or feces. A single IV infusion of 5&#x2009;mg [C]-zavegepant was well tolerated in healthy male subjects. Disposition findings of IV [C]-zavegepant are applicable to the disposition of the approved zavegepant nasal spray.
