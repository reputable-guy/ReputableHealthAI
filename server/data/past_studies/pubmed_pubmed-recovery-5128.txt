Study Title: Driving a motor vehicle and living with a mental health condition: The personal and professional experiences of consumer lived experience staff.

Study Summary:
Driving a motor vehicle is an important activity for people living with a mental health condition, as it can support engagement in the community as part of recovery. There is little research exploring mental health consumers' experiences with driving and no found research on the role of mental health lived experience staff in assisting consumers with safe driving. It is essential to learn about consumers' experiences of driving to know the supports they find useful in understanding their driver responsibilities and self-regulating their driving through periods of changing health and wellness. This study explored the personal and professional experiences of lived experience consumer staff related to driving a motor vehicle while also living with a mental health condition. The research was guided by the interpretive paradigm and codesign principles. Qualitative data were derived from semi-structured interviews with (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;9) lived experience consumers working in a public mental health service. Data were thematically analysed. Our research team involved consumer and occupational therapy coresearchers. Five main themes were identified: (1) Driving means freedom and independence, (2) A nuanced understanding about the impact of mental health on driving, (3) I/we can manage: A range of strategies, (4) Driving is not something mental health staff tend to discuss, and (5) Do not beat around the bush, just talk about it. Consumers want support and direct conversations about driving and their mental health, medication side effects, and strategies to gain their licence, maintain, or return to driving. Alongside mental health clinicians, consumer lived experience staff could play a vital role in supporting safe driving.
