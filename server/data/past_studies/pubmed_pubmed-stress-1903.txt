Study Title: The effect of trans-theoretical model interventions and motivational interviewing on stress, hope and psychological toughness in mothers of children with cancer.

Study Summary:
The present study aimed to determine the effect of trans-theoretical model (TTM) interventions and motivational interviews on stress, hope, and psychological toughness in mothers of children with cancer. In this interventional study, 70 mothers of children with cancer were randomly divided into control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, the mothers completed the questionnaires. Next, TTM-based intervention was implemented three times, once a week, each session lasting 20&#xa0;min. Trained nurses performed face-to-face motivational interviewing on each mother three times, each session lasting 20&#xa0;min. The parenting stress, hope, and toughness questionnaires were completed a month later for the intervention group. For the control group, questionnaires were completed at the beginning of the study and two months later. Data were analyzed using SPSS-23 software, Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's exact test, and t-test. The average stress score in the intervention group decreased by 30.62 points, while it increased by 4.45 points in the control group. The average score for hope in the intervention group increased by 4.45 points, but it increased by 2.54 points in the control group. Finally, the average toughness score of the intervention group increased by 24.68 points, while it decreased by 3.80 points in the control group. TTM-based intervention and motivational interviewing reduced parental stress and increased hope and perseverance among mothers in the intervention group, which may contribute to improved quality of care for children with cancer. According to this study, nurses and other treatment staff can use these interventions as effective methods to reduce stress and increase the hope and psychological toughness of mothers with children with cancer.
