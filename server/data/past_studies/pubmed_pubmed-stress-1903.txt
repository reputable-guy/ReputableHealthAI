Study Title: Natural History of Myocardial &#x3b1;&#x3b2;Integrin Expression After Acute Myocardial Infarction: Correlation with Changes in Myocardial Blood Flow.

Study Summary:
Angiogenesis is an essential part of the cardiac repair process after myocardial infarction, but its spatiotemporal dynamics remain to be fully deciphered.Ga-NODAGA-Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) is a PET tracer targeting &#x3b1;&#x3b2;integrin expression, which is a marker of angiogenesis.In this prospective single-center trial, we aimed to monitor angiogenesis through myocardial integrin &#x3b1;&#x3b2;expression in 20 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In addition, the correlations between the expression levels of myocardial &#x3b1;&#x3b2;integrin and the subsequent changes inRb PET/CT parameters, including rest and stress myocardial blood flow (MBF), myocardial flow reserve (MFR), and wall motion abnormalities, were assessed. The patients underwentGa-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT and rest and stressRb-PET/CT at 1 wk, 1&#x2009;mo, and 3&#x2009;mo after STEMI. To assessGa-NODAGA-RGD uptake, the summed restRb andGa-NODAGA-RGD images were coregistered, and segmental SUVs were calculated (RGD SUV).At 1 wk after STEMI, 19 participants (95%) presented increasedGa-NODAGA-RGD uptake in the infarcted myocardium. Seventeen participants completed the full imaging series. The values of the RGD SUV in the infarcted myocardium were stable 1&#x2009;mo after STEMI (1 wk vs. 1&#x2009;mo, 1.47&#x2009;g/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 1.37-1.64&#x2009;g/mL] vs. 1.47&#x2009;g/mL [IQR, 1.30-1.66&#x2009;g/mL];= 0.9), followed by a significant partial decrease at 3&#x2009;mo (1.32&#x2009;g/mL [IQR, 1.12-1.71&#x2009;g/mL];= 0.011 vs. 1 wk and 0.018 vs. 1&#x2009;mo). In segment-based analysis, positive correlations were found between RGD SUV at 1 wk and the subsequent changes in stress MBF (Spearman &#x3c1;:= 0.17,= 0.0033) and MFR (Spearman &#x3c1;:= 0.31,< 0.0001) at 1&#x2009;mo. A negative correlation was found between RGD SUV at 1 wk and the subsequent changes in wall motion abnormalities at 3&#x2009;mo (Spearman &#x3c1;:=0.12,= 0.035).The present study found that &#x3b1;&#x3b2;integrin expression is significantly increased in the infarcted myocardium 1 wk after STEMI. This expression remains stable after 1&#x2009;mo and partially decreases after 3&#x2009;mo. Initial &#x3b1;&#x3b2;integrin expression at 1 wk is significantly weakly correlated with subsequent improvements in stress MBF, MFR, and wall motion analysis.
