Study Title: A Combined Extract Derived from Black Sticky Rice and Dill Improves Clinical Symptoms and Ischemic Stroke Biomarkers in Transient Ischemic Attack and Ischemic Stroke Patients.

Study Summary:
Currently, the adjuvant therapy to optimize the restorative process after stroke is required due to the unsatisfied therapeutic efficacy. A combined extract of black sticky rice and dill showed potential in the preclinical state, so we hypothesized that it could provide clinical benefits. A three-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled study was set up to elucidate this issue. Both males and females (18-80 years old) who had experienced transient ischemic attacks or ischemic strokes within the last 5-10 days with an NIHSS score &#x2264; 7 and received standard treatment were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or capsule containing a combined extract of black sticky rice and dill at a dose of 600 or 1200 mg per day. The safety parameters, movement control, and degree of disability were assessed 1, 2, and 6 weeks after the intervention, and serum stroke biomarkers were assessed at the mentioned time points, except at 2 weeks. After week 1, the high-dose (1200 mg/day) treatment group had improved NIHSSS, VCAM1, and MMP-9. Both S100&#x3b2; and VCAM1 also improved at week 6, while the low-dose treatment group (600 mg/day) only exhibited improved VCAM1. Therefore, a high dose of the developed adjuvant supplement improves stroke recovery by improving motor impairment by reducing endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.
