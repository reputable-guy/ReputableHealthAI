Study Title: The effect of increasing duration of family members' presence on sleep status in patients with acute coronary syndrome in cardiac care unit: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of increasing duration of family members' presence on sleep status in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) admitted to the cardiac care unit. Randomized controlled trial. Ninety patients with ACS randomly assigned into two groups. No intervention was performed in control group. In the intervention group, the time of family members presence was changed from 1 h per day to 2 h per day from the second to the fourth day. Then, ST Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire was completed by the patients every day during the study. The patients in the intervention group had statistically significantly better sleep status during the course of intervention compared to the control group. The increasing duration of family members' presence can improve the sleep quality and quantity of ACS patients.
