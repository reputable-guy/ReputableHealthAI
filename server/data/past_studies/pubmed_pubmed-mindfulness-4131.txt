Study Title: Efficacy of a Mind Space Application intervention on psychological outcomes in Thai university students with depression: A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the Mind Space Application on psychological outcomes among Thai-university students with depression. Thai-university students with depression (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;50) were recruited between November 2021 and January 2022. Participants were randomly assigned to either an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention via the Mind Space Application intervention or a waitlist control group. Stress, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Post-intervention, compared to waitlist control group, participants using the Mind Space Application reported large effects in the reduction of stress (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.46, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001) and depression (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.88, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001), small to moderate effects in reduction of anxiety (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.35, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.35), but no significant. Also, mindfulness scores were significantly higher (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.90, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001) compared to the waitlist control group. Thai-university students with depression who used the Mind Space Application showed lower stress and depression and higher mindfulness compared to the waitlist group among. Similar applications may be useful as an alternative or combined with other treatments to improve psychological outcomes in other university student populations.
