Study Title: The Dose-Response in Elite Soccer: Preliminary Insights From Menstrual-Cycle Tracking During the FIFA Women's World Cup 2019.

Study Summary:
This preliminary study examined the influence of estimated menstrual-cycle (MC)&#xa0;phase on responses to soccer matches and training sessions in preparation for and during the FIFA (F&#xe9;d&#xe9;ration internationale de football association) Women's World Cup 2019. Twenty outfield players representing a national team were tracked over a 45-day period. External (10-Hz global positioning system; total and distance covered at high-metabolic power [&#x2265;20&#xa0;W&#xb7;kg-1]) and internal load measures (minutes &#x2265;80% heart-rate maximum, sessional ratings of perceived exertion) were collected during all training and matches, with single-item wellness measures (fatigue, soreness, sleep quality, and sleep duration) collected each morning prior to activity. MC phase was estimated individually via an algorithm, informed from pretournament survey responses and ongoing symptom reporting (FitrWoman). Model comparison statistics were used to determine the impact of estimated MC phase in nonhormonal contraceptive users (n = 16). Sessional rating of perceived exertion responses to total distances &#x2265;5&#xa0;km were higher during the luteal phase (+0.6-1.0&#xa0;au; P &#x2264; .0178) versus menstruation (phase 1), but no other observable dose-response trends were observed. Sleep, fatigue, and soreness ratings were not typically associated with MC phase, with the exception of exacerbated fatigue ratings in luteal versus follicular phase 48 hours postmatch (-0.73&#xa0;au, P = .0275). Preliminary findings suggest that estimated MC phase may contribute to the understanding of the dose-response to soccer training and matches.
