Study Title: Mass spectrometry-detected MGUS is associated with obesity and other novel modifiable risk factors in a high-risk population.

Study Summary:
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant condition of multiple myeloma with few known risk factors. The emergence of mass spectrometry (MS) for the detection of MGUS has provided new opportunities to evaluate its risk factors. In total, 2628 individuals at elevated risk for multiple myeloma were enrolled in a screening study and completed an exposure survey (PROMISE trial). Participant samples were screened by MS, and monoclonal proteins (M-proteins) with concentrations of &#x2265;0.2 g/L were categorized as MS-MGUS. Multivariable logistic models evaluated associations between exposures and MS outcomes. Compared with normal weight (body mass index [BMI] of 18.5 to <25&#xa0;kg/m2), obesity (BMI of &#x2265;30&#xa0;kg/m2) was associated with MS-MGUS, adjusting for age, sex, Black race, education, and income (odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.47; P&#xa0;= .003). High physical activity (&#x2265;73.5 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours per week vs <10.5 MET-hours per week) had a decreased likelihood of MS-MGUS (OR, 0.45, 95%&#xa0;CI, 0.24-0.80; P&#xa0;= .009), whereas heavy smoking and short sleep had increased likelihood of MS-MGUS (>30 pack-years vs never smoker: OR, 2.19; 95%&#xa0;CI, 1.24-3.74; P&#xa0;= .005, and sleep <6 vs &#x2265;6 hours per day: OR, 2.11; 95%&#xa0;CI, 1.26-3.42; P&#xa0;= .003). In the analysis of all MS-detected monoclonal gammopathies, which are inclusive of M-proteins with concentrations of <0.2 g/L, elevated BMI and smoking were associated with all MS-positive cases. Findings suggest MS-detected monoclonal gammopathies are associated with a broader range of modifiable risk factors than what has been previously identified. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03689595.
