Study Title: Integrated Cognitive-Behavioral Social Skills Training and Compensatory Cognitive Training for Negative Symptoms of Psychosis: Effects in a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (SZ) remain unmet treatment needs as they are highly prevalent, associated with poor functional outcomes, and resistant to pharmacologic treatment. The current pilot randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of an integrated Cognitive-Behavioral Social Skills Training and Compensatory Cognitive Training (CBSST-CCT) intervention compared to Goal-focused Supportive Contact (SC) on negative symptoms and cognitive performance. Fifty-five adults with SZ or schizoaffective disorder with moderate-to-severe negative symptoms were randomized to receive 25 twice-weekly, 1-h manualized group sessions (12.5 weeks total duration) of either CBSST-CCT or SC delivered by master's level clinicians in five community settings. Assessments of negative symptom severity (primary outcomes) and neuropsychological performance, functional capacity, social skills performance, and self-reported functional ability/everyday functioning, psychiatric symptom severity, and motivation (secondary outcomes) were administered at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Mixed-effects models using baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment data demonstrated significant CBSST-CCT-associated effects on negative symptom severity, as assessed by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (p = .049, r = 0.22), with improvements in diminished motivation driving this effect (p = .037, r = 0.24). The CBSST-CCT group also demonstrated improved verbal learning compared to SC participants (p = .026, r = 0.36). The effects of CBSST-CCT appeared to be durable at 6-month follow-up. CBSST-CCT improved negative symptom severity and verbal learning in high-negative-symptom individuals relative to SC. CBSST-CCT warrants larger investigations to examine its efficacy in treating negative symptoms, along with other symptoms, cognition, and, ultimately, real-world functional outcomes. Clinical Trial registration number NCT02170051.
