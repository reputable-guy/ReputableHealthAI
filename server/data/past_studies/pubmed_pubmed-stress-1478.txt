Study Title: The effects of remimazolam in combination with estazolam on postoperative hemodynamics and pain intensity in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effects of combining remimazolam with estazolam on hemodynamics and pain levels after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. A total of 184 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into four groups: Study Group 1(Remimazolam), Study Group 2(Estazolam), Study Group 3(Remimazolam&#x2009;+&#x2009;Estazolam), and Control Group. Anesthesia induction included intravenous injection of remimazolam and estazolam in the study groups, while the control group received normal saline. Hemodynamic parameters, stress responses, anxiety levels, and pain intensity were assessed at various time points. The results showed that the combination of remimazolam and estazolam significantly improved hemodynamic parameters compared to the control group. Study Group 3 exhibited the lowest anxiety levels and stress responses among all groups. Furthermore, Study Group 3 had the lowest pain intensity scores at different postoperative time points. The combination of remimazolam and estazolam effectively stabilized hemodynamics, reduced anxiety levels, and alleviated pain intensity after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. These findings suggest that this combination therapy has the potential to improve surgical outcomes and patient comfort.
