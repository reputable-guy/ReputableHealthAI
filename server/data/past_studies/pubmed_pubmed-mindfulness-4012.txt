Study Title: Yoga for Psychophysiological Wellbeing during Menstrual Phases in Eumenorrheic Females.

Study Summary:
Hormonal shifts during the menstrual cycle (MC) cause autonomic imbalances and psycho-physiological distress in eumenorrheic females. This present study reveals that yoga proactively improves the overall psychophysiological health and wellness in eumenorrheic female college students during different phases of MC. Healthy eumenorrheic female college students (M= 20.11&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.39 years, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;82) were randomized to a control and yoga group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41). A well-conceptualized yoga module (CYM) for 5 days/week for 3 months (1&#xa0;h daily in the morning) was practiced by the yoga group volunteers. Intra and intergroup comparisons were performed for the estimation of mindfulness awareness scale (MAAS), menstrual distress questionnaire (MDQ), cardiometabolic risk factors, heart rate variability (HRV), and endurance fitness during the luteal (LP) and follicular (FP) phases. Psychophysiological discomforts before CYM practice were mostly observed during LP compared to FP due to significant changes in mindfulness, pain, concentration, autonomic reactivity, negative affect, double product (DoP), rate pressure product (RPP), and HRV values. CYM practice influenced HRV parameters for an increase in parasympathetic activity and a decrease in sympathetic balance for better cardiac-autonomic functioning, with significant improvement in maximal oxygen consumption (VO) and physical work capacity (PWC). Accordingly, MAAS and MDQ scores also improved significantly after yogic practice. The intra-group and inter-group significant improvements in psychophysiological parameters through CYM practice are relevant in eumenorrheic females to perform effectively throughout their MC period, by improving MC distress and sympathovagal (LF/HF) balance.
