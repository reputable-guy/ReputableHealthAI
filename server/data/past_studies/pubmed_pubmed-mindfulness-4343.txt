Study Title: Effect of a mindfulness training app on a cigarette quit attempt: an investigator-blinded, 58-county randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable cancers. A majority of the 34 million people who currently smoke report wanting to quit. Mindfulness training apps offer a guided telehealth intervention to foster individuals' behavioral meditation practice. We present the main outcomes of a parallel-group randomized controlled trial that tested app-based mindfulness training vs attention control on smoking behavior. We enrolled adult residents from across California who smoked daily and were willing to make a quit attempt (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;213). Participants completed daily sessions in 10-minute segments for 14 consecutive days. Participants then started a quit attempt and reported daily smoking for 28&#x2009;days following the quit date using the timeline follow-back measure. Seven-day point-prevalence abstinence for each week during the 4-week quit period ranged from 21.8% to 27.7% for app-based mindfulness training and 17.9% to 19.6% for controls. The intention-to-treat sample revealed that app-based mindfulness training outperformed controls on the proportion of abstinence days during the quit period (odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.00, 95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.03 to 3.87, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.041). Although the 7-day point prevalence abstinence for week 4 favored app-based mindfulness training, significance was not reached (odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.65, 95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.84 to 3.23, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.148). The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day among smokers was 4.95 for app-based mindfulness training vs 5.69 for controls (odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.81, 95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.71 to 0.92, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002), suggesting harm reduction in continued smokers. A mindfulness training app prescribed for 2 weeks leading up to a quit date showed an advantage over controls for total abstinence days and fewer cigarettes smoked in a diverse sample consisting of urban and rural residents. These findings yield implications for the use of apps to reduce exposure to the carcinogenic properties of cigarette smoke.
