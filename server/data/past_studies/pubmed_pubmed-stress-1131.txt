Study Title: The effectiveness of multimedia mental health self-care program based on cyber space on the mental health of infertile women: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
So far, some training interventions have been carried out to improve the mental health in women with infertility, but designing the need and evidence-based, as well as multimedia mental health self-care interventions based on cyber space has received less attention. Due to the spread of the internet and the role of self-care in improving mental disorders, this study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the multimedia mental health self-care program on mental health and to assess the users' satisfaction. This study is a randomized controlled trial with pretest-posttest follow-up design. The sample was selected using a convenience sampling method (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;90). The random number function was used to assign random numbers. The research instruments include a demographic, psychological Well-being, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, fertility problems and satisfaction with training questionnaire. Six weeks of intervention was conducted following the pre-test and the link of each session's content was sent to the participants, based on the training schedule, through Eitaa Messenger. The post-test and follow-up were conducted 1&#xa0;week and 1&#xa0;month post intervention. The data were analyzed using independent t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. A statistically significant difference was observed between the intervention and control group in the mean score of psychological well-being, perceived stress and infertility stress 1&#xa0;week and 1&#xa0;month post intervention and in the mean score of depression and anxiety 1&#xa0;month post intervention. The intervention group scored higher than the control in psychological well-being but lower in perceived stress, depression, anxiety and infertility stress. The intervention had a positive effect and reduced the score of perceived stress, depression, anxiety and infertility in the intervention group over time. The score reduction continued until the follow-up stage. No significant time-interaction effect was observed on psychological well-being and on the control group. Satisfaction with the program and subscales was desirable. This program could significantly reduce the depression, anxiety, perceived stress and infertility stress and desirable satisfaction with the program was observed among users. This program can be used in designing the experimental and therapeutic interventions to improve mental-health self-care behaviors.
