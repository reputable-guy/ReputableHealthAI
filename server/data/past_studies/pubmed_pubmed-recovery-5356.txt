Study Title: Telehealth-delivered recovery-orientated well-being plan group program for bipolar disorder: a pilot randomised feasibility and acceptability study.

Study Summary:
Psychological interventions may assist in the management of bipolar disorder, but few studies have assessed the use of group therapy programs using telehealth. The present study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a well-being group program for people living with bipolar disorder designed to be delivered via telehealth (Zoom platform) using a randomised controlled pilot design. Participants were randomly assigned to either the 8-week well-being plan treatment condition or the wait-list control condition. They were administered a structured diagnostic instrument to confirm bipolar disorder diagnosis followed by a set of self-report questionnaires relating to mood, quality of life, personal recovery, and stigma. A total of 32 participants (16 treatment; 16 control) were randomised with 12 participants completing the intervention, and 13 the control condition. The program appeared acceptable and feasible (75% retention rate) with a mean attendance being reported of 7.25 sessions attended out of a possible 8 sessions. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction overall with the intervention, with a mean score of 9.18 out of 10. Preliminary evidence suggests that delivery of the group program online is feasible and acceptable for participants living with bipolar disorder. As the program was designed to prevent relapse over time, further research is needed to determine if the program may be helpful in improving symptom outcomes over a longer follow-up period.
