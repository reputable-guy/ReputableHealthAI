Study Title: The sustainability of exercise following colorectal surgery: A qualitative study of participants in the PREPARE-ABC trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to explore perceptions regarding the sustainability of exercise following participation in a pre- and post-colorectal surgery exercise intervention trial (PREPARE-ABC). Qualitative interview study. Data were analysed using framework analysis and independently coded by two researchers. Six United Kingdom National Health Service Trusts. Eighteen interviews (hospital-based exercise&#x2009;=&#x2009;9, home-based exercise&#x2009;=&#x2009;3, standard care&#x2009;=&#x2009;6) were conducted with patients 12-15 months after being randomised in the trial, after their 12 month appointment. Individuals who participated in one of two exercise intervention groups (hospital-supervised or home-supported exercise) or a standard care control group of the PREPARE-ABC trial were invited to interview. The exercise interventions were reported to influence participants' recovery and future sustainability of exercise behaviour change. Several participants continued to engage in exercise over a year after their surgery. Reasons for this included being engaged with exercise prior to diagnosis, psychological benefits of exercise and wanting to be engaged with something to help recovery. Perceptions about the sustainability of active lifestyles were influenced by confidence to engage in structured exercise or physical activity and beliefs about its potential to promote future wellness. Sustainability varies among individuals and early assessment of physical activity engagement could be beneficial. Physical activity interventions immediately following surgery may be important for future engagement.
