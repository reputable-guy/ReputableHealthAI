Study Title: Addressing Mental Health Symptoms Among COVID-19 Healthcare Workers: A Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Psychological stress among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, elevating mental health risks. Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) is an evidence-based intervention with potential to reduce psychological burden on frontline HCWs; however, no studies have examined its use among this population since the pandemic began. We designed a trial to assess the effects of a brief HRV-BF intervention delivered via telemedicine on measures of anxiety, depression and stress, and heart rate variability, compared to an in-person intervention. We hypothesised that the telemedicine intervention would be non-inferior to the in-person intervention. Using a randomized comparison trial design, we tested a 10-day brief heart rate variability biofeedback intervention among frontline HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. They received remote, 30-min guided sessions every other day and were taught methods of heart rate variability biofeedback. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed at baseline, 10&#xa0;days, and 40&#xa0;days with additional measures of anxiety measured before and after each session. HRV scores were collected at baseline, as well as during the course of the 10&#xa0;days. Multilevel modelling was used to examine the change in depression, anxiety, stress and HRV scores across multiple time points and session types (telemedicine vs. in-person). There was no significant differences between telemedicine (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32) and in-person (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15) interventions on the main outcomes. Both session types showed a significant decrease in depression, anxiety and stress scores across the entire intervention, and HRV scores significantly increased across both groups. Anxiety levels also significantly decreased after each session. The non-inferiority of the telemedicine intervention to a comparable in-person intervention affirms its promise for decreasing anxiety, depression and stress among frontline HCWs and may offer a cost-effective and feasible tool to use in crises situations.
