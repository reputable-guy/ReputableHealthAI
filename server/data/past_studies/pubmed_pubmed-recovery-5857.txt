Study Title: [Antibacterial therapy for acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: results of a randomized comparative clinical trial with amoxicillin + clavulanic acid EXPRESS].

Study Summary:
Acute tonsillopharyngitis is one of the most common types of respiratory tract infections. In case of bacterial etiologies of the disease, penicillin antibiotics are prescribed, in particular amoxicillin + clavulanic acid. Dispersible forms of antibiotics have a number of advantages over film-coated tablets and are characterized by better pharmacokinetic parameters that increase the effectiveness and safety of treatment, as well as patient compliance. To compare the effectiveness and safety of Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS in the form of dispersible tablets and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid in film-coated tablets in the treatment of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. A randomized comparative clinical study involved 60 adult patients diagnosed with acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. Group 1 (=30) received the Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS, dispersible tablets, 875+125 mg 2 times a day at the beginning of meals. Group 2 (=30) received Amoxiclav, film-coated tablets, 875+125 mg 2 times a day at the beginning of meals. The duration of the treatment was 10 days. The following procedures were performed to all participants: general clinical and otorhinolaryngological examinations, an express test to detect group A streptococcal antigens in a smear from the posterior pharyngeal wall (streptatest), assessment of symptoms of acute tonsillopharyngitis on the McIsaac scale, severity of sore throat, difficulty swallowing, swelling of the throat, measurement of body temperature, assessment of the clinical global impression of the therapy, adherence to treatment, frequency of the adverse reactions before treatment, 3 days after the beginning of therapy and after the course completion (day 10). Recovery occurred in 96.6% of patients in group 1 according to examination on the 10th day of treatment and in 93.3% of patients in group 2. The rate of fever regression was higher in group 1 - on the 3rd day of treatment, normalization of temperature was observed in 36.6% and 30% of patients in the comparison group. Pain syndrome, symptoms of throat swelling and difficulty swallowing significantly (<0.01) regressed by the 10th day in patients of both treatment groups. The incidence of adverse reactions on the 10th day of treatment in group 1 was 10%, in group 2 - 33.3% (=0.03). Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS has high therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, comparable to the Amoxiclav in film-coated tablets. At the same time, dispersible tablets of Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS demonstrated a significantly higher safety profile compared to the simple tablet form.
