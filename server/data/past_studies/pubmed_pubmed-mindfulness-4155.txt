Study Title: Mindfulness and self-regulation intervention for improved self-neglect and self-regulation in diabetic older adults.

Study Summary:
The current study aimed to assess the impact of combined interventions including mindfulness and self-regulation on self-neglect and self-regulation among Iranian older adults with type 2 diabetes. This was a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial study conducted among 135 older diabetic patients in Shiraz, Iran. Three urban healthcare centers (clusters) were randomly assigned to three study groups. The intervention groups received either a Self-Regulation-based Intervention Program (SRIP) or a Combined Mindfulness and Self-Regulation Intervention Program (CMSRIP), while the control group received routine care and COVID-19 prevention training. These training programs, which consisted of text and video-based content, were conducted over 24 weeks using WhatsApp as a mobile-based communication platform. Outcomes were measured using the Elder Self-Neglect Scale and Short-Form Self-Regulation Questionnaire at baseline, week 4, and week 16 post-intervention, with data analysis conducted using SPSSsoftware. The CMSRIP led to significantly greater improvement in the score of self-regulation (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;73.23, P-Value&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) and a reduction in the score of self-neglect (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;62.97, P-Value&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) at both 4 weeks and 16 weeks after education compared to SRIP. In the control group, there was also a slight improvement. Improvement of self-regulation and reduction of self-neglect in all three groups were less in week 16 than in week 4. Nevertheless, the changes in the intervention groups were significantly better than the control group. This study confirmed a combination of mindfulness-based intervention and self-regulation intervention can effectively improve self-neglect and self-regulation behavior in older patients with type 2 diabetes.Trial registration: This trial (ISRCTN77260130) was retrospectively registered on 28/09/2021.
