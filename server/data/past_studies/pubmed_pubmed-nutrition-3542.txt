Study Title: The Effect of Iron-Fortified Lentils on Blood and Cognitive Status among Adolescent Girls in Bangladesh.

Study Summary:
Iron deficiency is highly prevalent in South Asia, especially among women and children in Bangladesh. Declines in cognitive performance are among the many functional consequences of iron deficiency. We tested the hypothesis that, over the course of a 4-month iron fortification trial, cognitive performance would improve, and that improvement would be related to improvements in iron status. Participants included 359 adolescent girls attending Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) clubs as a subsample of a larger double-blind, cluster-randomized community trial in which participants were assigned to one of three conditions: a condition in which no lentils were supplied (NL, n = 118, but which had the usual intake of lentils), a control (non-fortified) lentil condition (CL, n = 124), and an iron-fortified lentil condition (FL, n = 117). In the FL and CL conditions, approximately 200 g of cooked lentils were served five days per week for a total of 85 feeding days. In addition to biomarkers of iron status, five cognitive tasks were measured at baseline (BL) and endline (EL): simple reaction time task (SRT), go/no-go task (GNG), attentional network task (ANT), the Sternberg memory search Task (SMS), and a cued recognition task (CRT). Cognitive performance at EL was significantly better for those in the FL relative to the CL and NL conditions, with this being true for at least one variable in each task, except for the GNG. In addition, there were consistent improvements in cognitive performance for those participants whose iron status improved. Although there were overall declines in iron status from BL to EL, the declines were smallest for those in the FL condition, and iron status was significantly better for those in FL condition at EL, relative to those in the CL and NL conditions. the provision of iron-fortified lentils provided a protective effect on iron status in the context of declines in iron status and supported higher levels of cognitive performance for adolescent girls at-risk of developing iron deficiency.
