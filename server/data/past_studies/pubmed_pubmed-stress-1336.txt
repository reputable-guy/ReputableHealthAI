Study Title: Identifying and addressing&#xa0;the&#xa0;needs of caregivers of patients with cancer: evidence on interventions and the role of patient advocacy groups.

Study Summary:
As the number of people with cancer increases, so does the number of informal caregivers. These caregivers frequently have multiple unmet needs and experience numerous burdens. Here we explore the crucial roles of these caregivers and categorize their unmet needs into four areas: information, relationship and communication, emotional support, and practical or financial needs. We provide evidence on emerging interventions aimed at supporting caregivers, including patient/caregiver assessments, education, collaborative care, financial assistance, wellness, informational programs, and an integrated caregiver clinic. Finally, we delve into the vital role that patient advocacy groups play in addressing the unmet needs of cancer patients and their caregivers by providing comprehensive support, including education, resources, counseling, guidance, and financial aid.
