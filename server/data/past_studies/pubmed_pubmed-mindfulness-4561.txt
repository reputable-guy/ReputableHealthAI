Study Title: Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of mindfulness training on antenatal blood pressure.

Study Summary:
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are one of the greatest causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Mindfulness training (MT) significantly reduces blood pressure in non-pregnant adults, yet MT has not been tested to reduce blood pressure in the prenatal period. The objectives of this pilot randomized clinical trial were to test the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of MT on rates of HDP among pregnant participants at risk for HDP. Exploratory analyses examined effects of MT on antenatal blood pressure. Participants were randomized to an 8-week phone-delivered MT intervention or usual care. Feasibility was defined by MT completion. Acceptability was defined by participants' satisfaction with the intervention. HDP outcomes were collected by medical chart review. Antenatal blood pressure values were extracted from medical records. Twenty-nine participants were randomized to phone-based MT (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;15) or usual care (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;14). 73% participants completed >5 MT sessions, indicating that MT was feasible. One hundred percent of participants indicated they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the intervention, suggesting the intervention was acceptable. Rates of HDP were lower in the MT vs. usual care condition (9% vs. 29%; OR: 0.25, 95% C.I.: 0.02-2.65) although this did not reach statistical significance. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were significantly lower at follow up among those randomized to MT vs. usual care. Results from this pilot trial suggest that prenatal MT is feasible and acceptable and may be a useful adjunctive preventative treatment for HDP among at-risk pregnant patients. gov identifier is NCT03679117.
