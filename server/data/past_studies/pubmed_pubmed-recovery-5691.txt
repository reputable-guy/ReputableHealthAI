Study Title: Aquatic High-Intensity Interval Deep Water Running Influence on Cardiometabolic Health and Cognitive Psychological Responses in Women.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effects of an 8-wk AHIIT-DWR intervention compared with land-based HIT training (LHIIT) on cardiometabolic health, cognitive, and psychological outcomes in inactive elderly women. Seventy inactive elderly women aged 60 yr or above were randomly assigned into two groups: AHIIT-DWR and LHIIT. The AHIIT-DWR group engaged in DWR sessions comprising 30 min of interval training, consisting of ten 2-min exercise bouts at 80%-90% of their maximal heart rate (HR max ), with 1-min active recovery at 70% HR max between bouts, for two sessions per week, for 8 wk. The LHIIT group performed treadmill running at the same intensity. Both groups showed similar cardiovascular fitness, maximal aerobic capacity (V&#x307;O 2max ), HR max , and RER improvement ( P > 0.05), whereas AHIIT-DWR showed a significant improvement in aerobic capacity minute ventilation (V&#x307;E), metabolic equivalents (METs), and O 2 pulse ( P < 0.05) over the 8-wk intervention. Both AHIIT-DWR and LHIIT significantly decreased triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL postintervention ( P < 0.05). No significant group differences were observed for cognitive function assessed by MMSE and MOCA ( P > 0.05). Both groups showed similar enjoyment levels, self-efficacy scores, and high adherence rates (>90%). Our study suggests that AHIIT-DWR can elicit a similar improvement in cardiorespiratory health, metabolic blood markers, cognitive function assessed by MMSE and MOCA, and psychological responses as LHIIT in inactive elderly women.
