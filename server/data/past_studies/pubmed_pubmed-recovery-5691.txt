Study Title: Early Postoperative Rapid Rehabilitation Yields More Favorable Short-term Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Patellar Realignment Surgery for Recurrent Patellar Dislocation: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Use of a rapid rehabilitation protocol for postoperative recovery after recurrent patellar dislocation (RPD) has gradually gained attention; nonetheless, evidence of its safety and effectiveness is lacking. To compare the short-term postoperative outcomes of early rapid rehabilitation with those of conservative rehabilitation in patients with RPD. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. A total of 50 patients with RPD who underwent tibial tubercle osteotomy combined with medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction were enrolled between January 2018 and February 2019. Postoperatively, the patients were randomly assigned to either the early rapid group (rapid group; n = 25 patients) or the conservative group (control group; n = 25 patients) for rehabilitation training. The rapid group underwent faster progression in weightbearing and range of motion (ROM) training. Knee joint functional scores, ROM, bilateral thigh circumference differences, and imaging data were recorded preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively for comparison. Postoperative complications were recorded over the 24-month follow-up period. The baseline data did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. Postoperatively, compared with the control group, the rapid group had higher Tegner scores at 6 weeks and 3 months; higher Lysholm scores at 3 and 6 months; higher International Knee Documentation Committee scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months; better ROM; and smaller bilateral thigh circumference differences at 24 months (< .05 for all). However, no differences were observed in the Tegner, Lysholm, and International Knee Documentation Committee scores at 24 months postoperatively. At the 6-week and subsequent follow-up visits, the Caton and Insall indices were lower in the control group than in the rapid group (< .01 for all). Moreover, compared with the control group, the rapid group had a lower incidence of patella baja at 24 months (0% vs 17%) and fewer complications during the whole follow-up period (< .01). Early rapid postoperative rehabilitation appears to be safe and effective for patients who undergo tibial tubercle osteotomy combined with medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction to treat RPD. In the short term, this approach was shown to be more advantageous than conservative rehabilitation in improving functional scores, allowing an earlier return to daily activities, although the lack of difference at 24 months implies no long-term benefits. In addition, it potentially helped to prevent the occurrence of complications, including patella baja. ChiCTR1800014648 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).
