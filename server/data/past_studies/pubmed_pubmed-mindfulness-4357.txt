Study Title: Social media usage and students' social anxiety, loneliness and well-being: does digital mindfulness-based&#xa0;intervention effectively work?

Study Summary:
The increasing integration of digital technologies into daily life has spurred a growing body of research in the field of digital psychology. This research has shed light on the potential benefits and drawbacks of digital technologies for mental health and well-being. However, the intricate relationship between technology and psychology remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based mobile apps on university students' anxiety, loneliness, and well-being. Additionally, it sought to explore participants' perceptions of the addictiveness of these apps. The research utilized a multi-phase approach, encompassing a correlational research method, a pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial, and a qualitative case study. Participants were segmented into three subsets: correlations (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;300), treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60), and qualitative (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). Data were gathered from various sources, including the social anxiety scale, well-being scale, social media use integration scale, and an interview checklist. Quantitative data was analyzed using Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and t-tests, while qualitative data underwent thematic analysis. The study uncovered a significant correlation between social media use and the variables under investigation. Moreover, the treatment involving mindfulness-based mobile apps led to a reduction in students' anxiety and an enhancement of their well-being. Notably, participants held various positive perceptions regarding the use of these apps. The findings of this research hold both theoretical and practical significance for the field of digital psychology. They provide insight into the potential of mindfulness-based mobile apps to positively impact university students' mental health and well-being. Additionally, the study underscores the need for further exploration of the intricate dynamics between technology and psychology in an increasingly digital world.
