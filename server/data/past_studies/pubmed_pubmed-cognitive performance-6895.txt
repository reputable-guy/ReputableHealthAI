Study Title: Sex differentials in relationships between functional fitness and cognitive performance in older adults: a canonical correlation analysis.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to explore the sex differentials in correlations between functional fitness (FF) and cognitive impairment (CI) in older adults without dementia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted using 2096 adults more than 65 years of age. The Senior Fitness test and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to measure FF and cognitive performance. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed to evaluate the relationships between FF and MMSE. Our results confirmed the relationships between FF and CI, furthermore FF and MMSE were significantly different between men and women (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). CCA results showed overall FF was positively correlated with overall MMSE in both men (canonical coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.37, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001) and women (first canonical coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.42, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001; second canonical coefficient&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Among men, 30s-arm curl and language were most highly correlated with FF and MMSE, respectively. Whereas among women, 30s-arm curl and eight-foot up-and-go were most highly correlated with FF, and orientation and recall were most highly correlated with MMSE. In conclusion, there was a sex difference in the relationships between FF and MMSE, which facilitated generating insight into cognitive performance improvement from the perspective of FF enhancement by sex. Prospective studies are needed to explore the causality between FF and cognitive performance.
