Study Title: Supporting Mental Health Well-Being in the Most Vulnerable Future Nurses.

Study Summary:
The aim of the study was to explore relationships between perceived faculty support and prevalence of severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress levels among undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students. Emerging research supports nursing students suffering from extreme psychological distress. Educational success and mental health wellness are influenced by external support. A mixed-methods design was used for this descriptive, cross-sectional study. A national convenience sample of 1,163 undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, Perceived Faculty Support Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Emerging themes in the qualitative data were identified. Nearly 54 percent of nursing students suffered from severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety, or stress. Faculty support was critical to nursing student mental health well-being. This multisite study provides a better understanding of the enormity of psychological distress among undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students and emphasizes the immediate need for faculty to provide necessary support to this vulnerable student population.
