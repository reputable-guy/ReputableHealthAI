Study Title: Telehealth Parenting Program and Salivary Epigenetic Biomarkers in Preschool Children With Developmental Delay: NIMHD Social Epigenomics Program.

Study Summary:
Children with developmental delays are at a heightened risk of experiencing mental health challenges, and this risk is exacerbated among racially minoritized children who face disproportionate adversity. Understanding the impact of parenting interventions on biological markers associated with these risks is crucial for mitigating long-term health disparities. To examine the effect of 20 weeks of an internet-based parent-child interaction training (iPCIT) program on biomarkers associated with aging and chronic inflammation among preschoolers with developmental delay at 12-month follow-up. An observational secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial conducted from March 17, 2016, to December 15, 2020, to assess changes in salivary DNA methylation (DNAm)-derived biomarkers following iPCIT intervention. Participants were recruited from 3 Part C early intervention sites in a large southeastern US city. Eligible participants included children recruited within 3 months of their third birthday who had a Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing Problems T score greater than 60 and provided saliva in at least 1 study wave. Data analysis was conducted May 2023 to April 2024. Participants received either iPCIT (a telehealth therapeutic intervention focused on enhancing the parent-child relationship and addressing behavioral challenges in young children) or referrals as usual. DNAm at the 12-month follow-up was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC Bead Chip Assay to derive biomarkers DunedinPACE, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Analyses were intent-to-treat and used path analysis. A total of 71 children (mean [SD] age, 36.27 [0.61] months 51 male [71.8%] and 20 female [28.2%]) were analyzed, of whom 34 received iPCIT and 37 received referrals as usual. The iPCIT group had a slower pace of aging (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.26; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.50; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03) and less DNAm-derived CRP (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.49; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01) relative to the control condition at the 12-month follow-up. These associations remained significant after accounting for baseline DNAm score, child demographics, and symptom severity, and were independent of predicted buccal epithelial cell proportion for both DunedinPACE and CRP. There was no association with DNAm-derived IL-6 (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.14; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.36; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.21). In this study of a parenting intervention, iPCIT, the association of intervention with decreased molecular markers of inflammation and biological aging suggests their potential to modify aspects of the biological embedding of stress. Understanding the systemic biological impact of such interventions offers insights into addressing health disparities and promoting resilience among vulnerable populations.
