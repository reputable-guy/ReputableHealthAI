Study Title: Effect of a Mindfulness and Motivational Interviewing-Oriented Physical-Psychological Integrative Intervention for Community-Dwelling Spinal Cord Injury Survivors: A Mixed-Methods Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a mindfulness and motivational interviewing-oriented physical-psychological integrated intervention in community-dwelling spinal cord injury (SCI) survivors. A mixed-methods randomized controlled trial. Local organizations for handicapped in Hong Kong. Community-dwelling adults with SCI (N=72). Participants in the intervention group (n=36) received video-guided exercise for daily practice and online group psychological (mindfulness and motivational interviewing-oriented) weekly sessions for 8 weeks. Participants in the control group (n=36) received an 8-week online group didactic education on lifestyle discussions and general health suggestions. Primary outcomes included quality of life, physical activity, depression, and chronic pain. Secondary outcomes included exercise self-efficacy and mindfulness. Outcomes were measured at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. Focus-group interviews were conducted postintervention. The recruitment, retention, and adherence rates were 84.7%, 100%, and 98.6%, respectively. The intervention showed significant positive effects on preventing declines in quality of life at 3-month follow-up (Cohen d=0.70, 95% CI=0.22-1.18). Positive trends manifested in physical activity, depression, chronic pain, and exercise self-efficacy. Three qualitative categories were identified: subjective improvements in exercise, physical, and social well-being; perceived changes in mindfulness and mental well-being; and intervention facilitators and barriers. The mindfulness and motivational interviewing-oriented physical-psychological integrated intervention is feasible and acceptable. The significant prolonged effect in maintaining quality of life and positive effects on physical and psychosocial well-being indicate its value to address major health challenges of community-dwelling SCI survivors.
