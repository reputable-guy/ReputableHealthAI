Study Title: The Impact of Education and Implementation Tools on Pre-Service Teachers' Attitudes About Classroom-Based Mindfulness.

Study Summary:
A growing body of research suggests that incorporating classroom-based mindfulness interventions in elementary schools can lead to improvements in student behavior, self-regulation, and measures of mental health and wellness. This quality improvement project explored the impact of an educational intervention on pre-service teachers' perceptions, attitudes, and intentions to implement mindfulness interventions in their classrooms. A brief educational intervention and website resource were provided to multidisciplinary teaching credential students. Participants completed a pre- and post-intervention survey to evaluate their intentions to implement mindfulness practices, as well as their perceptions about the acceptability, reasonableness, and effectiveness of incorporating mindfulness interventions in the classroom. Significant differences in pre- to post-intervention survey scores indicate that exposure to mindfulness concepts, practices, and resources may increase the willingness of pre-service teachers to adopt these practices in their classrooms.
