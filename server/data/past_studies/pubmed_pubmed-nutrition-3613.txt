Study Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Effects of a Web-Based Intervention on Perceived Stress and Diet Quality Among First-Year University Students.

Study Summary:
e-Health interventions can potentially improve health care. My Viva Plan(MVP) is a web-based program that focuses on mindfulness, nutrition, and physical fitness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of this platform on stress indicators and diet quality among first-year university students. Ninety-seven university students were enrolled in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomized into control (&#x2009;=&#x2009;49) and MVP (&#x2009;=&#x2009;48) groups. Perceived stress was measured using the self-report Stress Indicator Questionnaire. Diet quality was assessed by the nutrient-rich foods index, and body composition was assessed by a hand-to-foot, multifrequency, bioelectrical impedance analysis. There were no differences in physical, sleep, behavioral, emotional, and personal habit indicators between groups. Diet quality and body composition were similar between groups, except among women in the MVP group with decreased body fat (-1.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.6&#x2009;kg,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Participant engagement was low: 50% of the MVP group did not access the platform. The MVP web-based intervention was not associated with improvements in stress indicators, diet quality, and body composition, likely due to the characteristics of our cohort of healthy young individuals. Future studies should focus on enhancing motivational approaches to explore the potential of e-health interventions that improve health behavior. Clinical Trial Registration number: NCT03579264A.
