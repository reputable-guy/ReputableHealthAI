Study Title: Acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy for trichotillomania in adults: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Given the limited treatment options for trichotillomania (TTM), or Hair Pulling Disorder, this large randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy for TTM (AEBT-TTM) in reducing TTM severity relative to psychoeducation and supportive therapy (PST). Eighty-five adults (78 women) with TTM received 10 sessions (over 12 weeks) of either AEBT-TTM or PST. Independent evaluators masked to treatment assignment assessed participants at baseline (week 0), midpoint (week 6), and endpoint (week 12). Consistent with a priori hypotheses, 64% of the adults treated with AEBT-TTM were classified as clinical responders at post-treatment relative to 38% treated with PST. Clinical responders were identified by a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. Relative to the PST group, the AEBT-TTM group demonstrated significantly greater pre-to post-treatment reductions on the self-report Massachusetts General Hospital-Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HS) and the evaluator-rated National Institute of Mental Health Trichotillomania Severity Scale (NIMH-TSS). There were no significant post-treatment group differences on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale, or rate of TTM diagnoses. Results suggest AEBT-TTM provides greater treatment benefit than PST. Future research should continue to investigate AEBT-TTM along with mediators and moderators of its efficacy.
