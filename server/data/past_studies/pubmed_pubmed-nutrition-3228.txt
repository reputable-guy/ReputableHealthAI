Study Title: Examining the impact of differing caffeine dosages in conjunction with plyometric training on physiological adaptations in basketball players.

Study Summary:
The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of ingesting different dosages of caffeine (CAF) prior to plyometric jump training (PJT) on sport-related performance and physiological parameters in male basketball players. Twenty-four young athletes were randomly divided into 3 groups and performed 6&#xa0;weeks of PJT while consuming 3&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kgof body mass caffeine (CAF3, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), 6&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kgbody mass caffeine (CAF6, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) or placebo (PL; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) one hour prior to each training session. Before and after the 6-week PJT, the players were evaluated for field-based basketball-specific performance measures (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, Illinois change of direction speed [CODS], and maximal strength) and lab-based physiological (aerobic capacity and anaerobic power) parameters. CAF3, CAF6, and PL groups demonstrated significant improvements in vertical jump (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.07, 1.45, and 1.1, respectively), 20-m sprint (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;- 0.50, - 0.61, and - 0.36), change of direction performance (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;- 1.22, - 1.26, and - 1.09), maximal strength (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.68, 2.29, and 1.17), maximum oxygen uptake (V&#x307;O) (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.09, 1.59, and 0.92), and peak (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.82, 1.85, and 0.82) and average power output (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.39, 1.32, and 1.07) after 6&#xa0;weeks of training. Comparative analysis of individual adaptive responses to training indicated that the CAF6 led to insignificantly greater effects in vertical jump (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.45), maximal strength (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.29), and V&#x307;O(ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.59) with lower residuals in individual changes and lower coefficient of variations (CV) in mean group changes. Regarding sprint and CODS performance, both experimental groups indicated similar changes, residuals in individual changes, and CVs in mean group changes. Overall, consuming 6&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kgbody mass caffeine induces superior adaptations in aerobic fitness, anaerobic power, and sport-specific performance measures, with lower inter-individual variability in the adaptations and more homogenized changes over the training period.
