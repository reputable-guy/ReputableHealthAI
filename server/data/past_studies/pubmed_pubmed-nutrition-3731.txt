Study Title: Analysis of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism by compound-specific isotope analysis in humans.

Study Summary:
Natural variations in theC:C ratio (carbon-13 isotopic abundance [&#x3b4;C]) of the food supply have been used to determine the dietary origin and metabolism of fatty acids, especially in the n-3 PUFA biosynthesis pathway. However, n-6 PUFA metabolism following linoleic acid (LNA) intake remains under investigation. Here, we sought to use natural variations in the &#x3b4;C signature of dietary oils and fatty fish to analyze n-3 and n-6 PUFA metabolism following dietary changes in LNA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)&#xa0;+ DHA in adult humans. Participants with migraine (aged 38.6 &#xb1; 2.3&#xa0;years, 93% female, body mass index of 27.0 &#xb1; 1.1&#xa0;kg/m) were randomly assigned to one of three dietary groups for 16&#xa0;weeks: 1) low omega-3, high omega-6 (H6), 2) high omega-3, high omega-6 (H3H6), or 3) high omega-3, low omega-6 (H3). Blood was collected at baseline, 4, 10, and 16&#xa0;weeks. Plasma PUFA concentrations and &#x3b4;C were determined. The H6 intervention exhibited increases in plasma LNA &#x3b4;C signature over time; meanwhile, plasma LNA concentrations were unchanged. No changes in plasma arachidonic acid &#x3b4;C or concentration were observed. Participants on the H3H6 and H3 interventions demonstrated increases in plasma EPA and DHA concentration over time. Plasma &#x3b4;C-EPA increased in total lipids of the H3 group and phospholipids of the H3H6 group compared with baseline. Compound-specific isotope analysis supports a tracer-free technique that can track metabolism of dietary fatty acids in humans, provided that the isotopic signature of the dietary source is sufficiently different from plasma &#x3b4;C.
