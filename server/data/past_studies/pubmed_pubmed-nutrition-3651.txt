Study Title: [Electroacupuncture at acupoints ofmeridians for sarcopenia: a randomized controlled trial].

Study Summary:
To observe the clinical effect of electroacupuncture at acupoints ofmeridians for sarcopenia. A total of 60 patients with sarcopenia were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 30 cases in each group. In the control group, conventional nutrition intervention for sarcopenia was adopted. In the observation group, on the basis of the treatment in the control group, acupuncture was applied at bilateral Binao (LI 14), Quchi (LI 11), Zusanli (ST 36), Yanglingquan (GB 34), etc.,ipsilateral Quchi (LI 11) and Zusanli (ST 36) were connected to electroacupuncture, with discontinuous wave, 2 Hz in frequency, 1-10 mA in intensity, 2 times a week, with a interval of 3 days. A total of 12-week treatment was required in the two groups. Before and after treatment, the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), grip strength, 6 m-walking time, body fat percentage and body moisture percentage were observed in the two groups. Compared with those before treatment, after treatment, ASMI and grip strength were increased while 6 m-walking time was shortened in the two groups (<0.05); body fat percentage was decreased while body moisture percentage was increased in the observation group (<0.05). After treatment, in the observation group, ASMI, grip strength and body moisture percentage were increased (<0.05), 6 m-walking time was shortened and body fat percentage was decreased (<0.05) compared with those in the control group. Electroacupuncture at acupoints ofmeridians can effectively improve the skeletal muscle mass, muscle function, body fat percentage and body moisture percentage in patients with sarcopenia, and make the distribution of muscle and fat more reasonable.
