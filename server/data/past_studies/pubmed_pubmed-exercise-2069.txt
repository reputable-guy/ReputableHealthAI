Study Title: Can transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the motor cortex increase endurance running performance? a randomized crossover-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, has been shown to increase exercise performance in strength and cycling studies but its effects on running endurance remain unclear. The objectives of this randomized sham-controlled crossover trial were to assess tDCS efficacy on submaximal treadmill running time to exhaustion (TTE). Forty-five healthy male runners aged between 18 and 32 years (mean maximal oxygen consumption: 46.6 mL/min/kg) performed two constant-load tests at 90% of their maximal aerobic speed preceded by 20 minutes of active or sham multichannel (5 anodes, 3 cathodes) tDCS applied over the bilateral motor cortex with a total intensity of 4 mA. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), blood lactate, VO2, and heart rate were monitored every five minutes until volitional exhaustion. The median [IQR] TTE was similar following active (12.2 [10.5, 16.1] minutes) or sham (12.5 [10.2, 15.1] minutes) tDCS (p = 0.96). Likewise, there were no significant differences between active and sham conditions for RPE, blood lactate, final VO2, and final heart rate (all p &#x2265;0.05). No difference in TTE was found when stratifying groups according to their VO2max (i.e., VO2max &#x2265; 45 mL/min/Kg, p = 0.53; VO2max < 45 mL/min/Kg, p = 0.45) but there was a trend for a significant correlation between VO2max and change in TTE (p = 0.06). TDCS applied over the bilateral motor cortex did not improve endurance performance in a large sample of trained runners. Characterization of individual tDCS responsiveness deserves further consideration. In our experimental conditions, tDCS had no ergogenic effect on endurance running performance.
