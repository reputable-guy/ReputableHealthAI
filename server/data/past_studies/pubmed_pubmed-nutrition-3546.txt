Study Title: Comparison of Protocol-Based Continuous and Intermittent Tube Feeding in Mechanically Ventilated Critically Ill Children - An Open Label Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To compare the time taken to reach the target calories and proteins by protocol based "continuous tube feeding (CTF)" and "intermittent tube feeding (ITF)" in critically ill children. This trial was conducted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a tertiary care institute. Eligible children were randomized to receive CTF or ITF. Target calories were defined as 70% of calorie amount as per the WHO formula and target protein was defined as 1.5 g/kg as per the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) criteria. The primary outcome was time taken to reach target calories, the secondary outcomes were time taken to reach target protein, incidence of feed intolerance, PICU mortality, duration of ventilation, and outcome on 28th day. Fifty-eight children were randomized; 29 in each group. The baseline characters were comparable. The median (IQR) times for reaching target calories were 1.7 (1.4, 2.5) d and 1.8 (1.4, 4.4) d in the CTF and ITF groups, respectively [Hazards ratio (HR) 0.89 (95% CI 0.5, 1.5); p = 0.69]. For the target protein intake, the median times were comparable in the 2 groups [HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.4-1.5); p&#xa0;= 0.55]. The other outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. The authors did not observe any difference in the time taken to reach target calories and protein between the two different modes of delivery of enteral nutrition.
