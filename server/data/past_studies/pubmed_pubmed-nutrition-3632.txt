Study Title: Early enteral nutrition intervention promotes multiple functional recovery in patients with traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage: A prospective randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
To delve into how early enteral nutrition intervention exert its part in promoting multiple functional recovery in patients with traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (TICH). This prospective randomized controlled study recruited 152 traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage patients in our hospital. The observation group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;77) received early enteral nutrition intervention (&#x2264; 48&#xa0;h), while the control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;75) were given delayed enteral nutrition (> 48&#xa0;h). Further comparison was performed on the recovery of various physiologic functions between the two groups. After treatment, GCS score and GOS score in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), and mRS Score was significantly lower than that in the control group (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Moreover, the observation group demonstrated a considerable post-treatment elevation in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (Cor) levels, which were notably higher than the control group's levels (both P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The changes in Bifidobacteria, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli values pre and post-treatment were more remarkable in the observation group (all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis indicated a substantial difference in survival curves between patients who provided with early enteral nutrition and those where it later (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The early application of enteral nutrition can promote neurological function recovery, improve the disorder of intestinal flora and the patient's nutritional status, reduce the increase of injury factors under stress, and lower the mortality risk among patients suffering from TICH.
