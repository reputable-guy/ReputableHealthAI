Study Title: Cognitive Impairment During Combined Normobaric vs. Hypobaric and Normoxic vs. Hypoxic Acute Exposure.

Study Summary:
Exposure to hypoxia has a deleterious effect on cognitive function; however, the putative effect of hypobaria remains unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate cognitive performance in pilot trainees who were exposed to acute normobaric (NH) and hypobaric hypoxia (HH). Of relevance for military pilots, we also aimed to assess cognitive performance in hypobaric normoxia (HN).A total of 16 healthy pilot trainees were exposed to 4 randomized conditions (i.e., normobaric normoxia, NN, altitude level of 440 m; HH at 5500 m; NH, altitude simulation of 5500 m; and HN). Subjects performed a cognitive assessment (KLT-R test). Cerebral oxygen delivery (cDO&#x2082;) was estimated based middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) and pulse oxygen saturation (So&#x2082;) monitored during cognitive assessment.Percentage of errors increased in NH (14.3 9.1%) and HH (12.9 6.4%) when compared to NN (6.5 4.1%) and HN (6.0 4.0%). Number of calculations accomplished was lower only in HH than in NN and HN. When compared to NN, cDO&#x2082; decreased in NH and HH.Cognitive performance was decreased similarly in acute NH and HH. The cDO&#x2082; reduction in NH and HH implies insufficient MCAv increase to ensure cognitive performance maintenance. The present study suggests negligible hypobaric influence on cognitive performance in hypoxia and normoxia.
