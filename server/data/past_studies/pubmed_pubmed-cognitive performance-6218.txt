Study Title: Novel Energy Drink Improves Cognitive Function and Mood, without Influencing Myocardial Oxygen Demand or Ventricular Repolarization in Adult Gamers: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial.

Study Summary:
To examine the efficacy of acute consumption of a novel energy drink (C4S) versus placebo for improving cognitive and gaming performance and mood. Secondarily, we examined the cardiovascular safety profile of acute C4S consumption. Forty-five healthy, young adult video gamers completed two experimental visits in randomized order where they consumed either C4S or a placebo and then completed a validated battery of neurocognitive tests, played five video games, and completed a mood state survey. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram measurements were taken at baseline and repeated throughout each visit. Acute consumption of C4S improved cognitive flexibility (absolute mean or median difference [95% CI] = +4.3 [2.2-6.4];&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.63), executive function (+4.3 [2.3-6.3];&#x2009;0.001;&#x2009;0.63), sustained attention (+2.1 [0.6-3.6];.01;&#x2009;0.44), motor speed (+2.9 [0.8-4.9];&#x2009;0.001;&#x2009;0.44), psychomotor speed (+3.9 [0.1-7.7];&#x2009;0.04;&#x2009;0.32) working memory (+1.0 [0.1-1.9];&#x2009;0.02;&#x2009;0.35), and performance in the two-dimensional visuospatial game Tetris (+463 [-419-2,065] pts;&#x2009;0.049;&#x2009;0.30) compared to placebo. C4S also improved Fatigue-Inertia (-1 [-3-0];&#x2009;0.004;&#x2009;0.45), Vigor-Activity (+2.4 [1.3-3.6];&#x2009;0.001;&#x2009;0.64), Friendliness (+0 [0-1];&#x2009;0.04;&#x2009;0.32), and Total Mood Disturbance (-3 [-6-0];&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002;&#x2009;0.44). BP increased slightly in C4S versus placebo, while HR decreased from baseline to post-drink in the C4S condition. Rate-pressure-product was higher in C4S versus placebo independent of time but did not increase from baseline. There was no effect on corrected QT interval. Acute consumption of C4S was efficacious for cognitive performance, visuospatial gaming performance, and mood enhancement, and had no effect on myocardial oxygen demand or ventricular repolarization, despite being associated with increases in BP.
