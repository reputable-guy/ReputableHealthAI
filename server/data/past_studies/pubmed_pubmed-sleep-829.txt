Study Title: Clinical Efficacy of Ultrasound-Guided Acupuncture in the Treatment of Chronic Subjective Dizziness.

Study Summary:
To investigate the clinical impact of ultrasound-guided acupuncture on persistent subjective vertigo as well as how it affects people's moods and life&#xa0;quality. The subjects of this study were 100 patients who were being treated at Li Huili Hospital from December, 2022 to December, 2023 for persistent subjective vertigo. With 50 instances in each category, individuals with chronic subjective dizziness were randomly assigned to the shallow acupuncture control category & the regular acupuncture category. Clinical effectiveness, Pittsburgh Sleep volume (PSQI), vestibular Disability Scale (DHI) score, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score &&#xa0;Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA),&#xa0;changes were evaluated among the two categories before and following therapy. The frequency of negative side effects following acupuncture therapy was contrasted among the two categories. Following treatment, the conventional acupuncture category's overall effectiveness rate was 94%, which was higher than that of the shallow acupuncture category (80%) and was highly significant (&#x3c7;2=4.332, P < .05). Post-treatment DHI, HAMA,&#xa0;HAMD, FSS, and PSQI scale scores in both categories were lower than those before therapy. Individuals receiving regular acupuncture showed significantly lower scores on the DHI, HAMA, HAMD, FSS, and PSQI scales when compared to those receiving shallow acupuncture control. Following therapy, the prevalence of adverse reactions in the conventional acupuncture category was 24 (48.00%) as well as 34 (68.00%) in the shallow acupuncture control category. respectively. This difference in incidence was statistically significant (P < .05), with the conventional acupuncture category experiencing fewer adverse reactions than the shallow acupuncture control category. Ultrasound-guided acupuncture is effective in the treatment of chronic subjective dizziness, helping to relieve dizziness symptoms, and actively improving patients' mood, sleep, and quality of life, it merits clinical advancement.
