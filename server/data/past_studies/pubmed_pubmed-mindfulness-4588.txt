Study Title: Burnout, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Resident Physicians 18 Months Into the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study.

Study Summary:
Burnout among resident physicians has been an area of concern that predates the COVID-19 pandemic. With the significant turmoil during the pandemic, this study examined resident physicians' burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress as well as the benefits of engaging in activities related to wellness, mindfulness, or mental wellbeing. A cross-sectional survey of 298 residents from 13 residency programs sponsored by the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita was conducted in October and November 2021. A 31-item questionnaire measured levels of burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress. A mixed method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis tests, adjusted odds ratios (aOR), and immersion-crystallization methods were used to analyze the data. There was a 52% response rate, with 65.8% (n = 102) of the respondents reporting manifestations of burnout. Those who reported at least one manifestation of burnout experienced a higher level of emotional exhaustion (aOR = 6.73; 95% CI, 2.66-16.99; p < 0.01), depression (aOR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.41; p = 0.01), anxiety (aOR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30; p = 0.04), and stress (aOR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64; p < 0.01). Some wellness activities that respondents engaged in included regular physical activities, meditation and yoga, support from family and friends, religious activities, time away from work, and counseling sessions. The findings suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant rate of burnout and other negative mental health effects on resident physicians. Appropriate wellness and mental health support initiatives are needed to help resident physicians thrive in the health care environment.
