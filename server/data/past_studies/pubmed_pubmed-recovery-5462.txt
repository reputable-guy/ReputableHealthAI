Study Title: Nutritional support in hospitalised patients with diabetes and risk for malnutrition: a secondary analysis of an investigator-initiated, Swiss, randomised controlled multicentre trial.

Study Summary:
The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of nutritional support on mortality in hospitalised patients with diabetes and nutritional risk participating in the(EFFORT) trial. Secondary analysis of a Swiss-wide multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Patients with diabetes and risk for malnutrition. Individualised nutritional support versus usual care. 30-day all-cause mortality. Of the 2028 patients included in the original trial, 445 patients were diagnosed with diabetes and included in this analysis. In terms of efficacy of nutritional therapy, there was a 25% lower risk for mortality in patients with diabetes receiving nutritional support compared with controls (7% vs 10%, adjusted HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.43)), a finding that was not statistically significant but similar to the overall trial effects with no evidence of interaction (p=0.92). Regarding safety of nutritional therapy, there was no increase in diabetes-specific complications associated with nutritional support, particularly there was no increase in risk for hyperglycaemia (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.67 p=0.90). Patients with diabetes and malnutrition in the hospital setting have a particularly high risk for adverse outcomes and mortality. Individualised nutritional support reduced mortality in this secondary analysis of a randomized trial, but this effect was not significant calling for further large-scale trials in this vhighly ulnerable patient population.
