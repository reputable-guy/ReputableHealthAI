Study Title: Risk factors of textbook outcome in laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy: results from a prospective high-volume center study.

Study Summary:
Achieving textbook outcome (TO) implies a smooth recovery post-operation without specified composite complications. This study aimed to evaluate TO in laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) and identify independent risk factors associated with achieving TO. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial on LPD at West China Hospital (ChiCTR1900026653). Patients were categorized into the TO and non-TO groups. Perioperative variables were compared between these groups. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to identify the risk factors. A total of 200 consecutive patients undergoing LPD were included in this study. TO was achieved in 82.5% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;165) of the patients. Female patients (OR: 2.877, 95% CI: 1.219-6.790; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016) and those with a hard pancreatic texture (OR: 2.435, 95% CI: 1.018-5.827; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046) were associated with an increased likelihood of achieving TO. TO can be achieved in more than 80% of patients in a high-volume LPD center. Independent risk factors associated with achieving TO included gender (male) and pancreatic texture (soft).
