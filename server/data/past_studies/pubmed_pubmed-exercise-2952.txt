Study Title: Cardiac autonomic modulation and exercise capacity in older adults with intellectual disability: A 6-month randomised control trial.

Study Summary:
Despite reported physical and functional improvements with aerobic and sprint interval training (SIT) protocols in individuals with intellectual disability (ID), it is not known if these interventions' effectivity would promote improvements in cardiac autonomic modulation. This study aimed to investigate if a 6-month SIT or a continuous aerobic programme could enhance physical performance and cardiac autonomic modulation at rest, during physical activity (PA) and after it in older adults with an ID. This is a randomised control trial. Participants with ID (age: 50.58&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7.25) were allocated to one of three groups [multicomponent aerobic training group (MATG), multicomponent interval sprint training group (MISTG) and control group (CG)]. The programmes lasted 24&#xa0;weeks, with three sessions/week, 75-90&#xa0;min per session. The HRV was analysed at rest and recovery, the delta of heart rate (HR) was analysed during 6MWT, and the HR t-off kinetics was analysed in recovery after 6MWT. There were not found differences between groups, moments, or interaction for cardiac autonomic modulation at rest and recovery. During exercise, only MSITG showed a significant increase of HR between rest and the first 30&#xa0;s of exercise (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Physical performance increased only in MSITG (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), while CG showed a significant reduction (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). The MSITG improved the physical performance and the vagal withdrawal at the beginning of the submaximal exercise. These findings suggest that high-intensity exercise may positively impact baroreflex function, mitigating the decline in autonomic reflex response capacity associated with aging in individuals with ID.
