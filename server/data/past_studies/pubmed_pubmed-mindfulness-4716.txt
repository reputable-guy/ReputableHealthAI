Study Title: Nutritional Wellness for the Busy Health Care Provider: Small Everyday Wins.

Study Summary:
When describing health care provider wellness, diet and nutrition are typically not addressed. This, in combination with the lack of decent food and diet resources typically available to the typically busy health care provider, exposes a significant gap in the road to advancing clinician wellness. This article aims to describe the relationship between nutrition and well-being, and potential barriers to optimal nutrition encountered by health care providers in the workplace. Readily available and practical strategies to improve physician diet and nutrition include: mindful eating practices, home meal preparation, food journaling, and mobile applications. From an organizational level, once physicians are making more informed food choices it is the hospital's responsibility to make nutritional options available in the workplace.
