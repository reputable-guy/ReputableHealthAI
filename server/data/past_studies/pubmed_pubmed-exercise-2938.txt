Study Title: The relationship between sustained hamstring pain and reorganisation of somatosensory representations: a randomised, controlled study.

Study Summary:
Recurrent hamstring injuries are highly prevalent amongst sporting populations. It has been hypothesised that pain from an initial hamstring injury may induce reorganisation of somatosensory representations that could contribute to reinjury. However, because of the cross-sectional nature of existing research, it remains unknown whether somatosensory changes are a cause or effect of pain or if they are driven by other potentially confounding factors. Here, we explored the effect of experimentally induced sustained hamstring pain on tasks that interrogate somatosensory and spatial representations. Fifty healthy participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group that performed an eccentric exercise protocol on the right hamstring to induce delayed onset muscle soreness or a control group performing a repetition-matched concentric exercise protocol. The tactile cortical representation was assessed using two-point discrimination and tactile localisation, whereas the proprioceptive representation was assessed using a left-right judgement task. Peripersonal spatial representations were assessed using an auditory localisation task. Assessments were performed at baseline and day 2. No between-group differences in tactile acuity were observed. However, improvements in left-right judgments and worsening of auditory localisation occurred in the experimental group compared with the control group. This study provides preliminary evidence showing that somatosensory changes occur in response to sustained hamstring pain. Experimentally induced, sustained hamstring pain elicited enhancements in proprioceptive processing and deficits in peripersonal spatial processing, suggesting a shift in the allocation of attentional resources from the external (peripersonal) to internal (body) environment. These findings may hold important implications for reinjury risk and rehabilitation following hamstring pain.
