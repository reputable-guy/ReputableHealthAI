Study Title: Efficacy of ready-to-use food supplement for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition among children aged 6 to 59 months.

Study Summary:
Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) is a persistent public health problem in Tanzania. The current approach for its management is nutrition counselling. However, there has been no commercial production of ready-to-use supplementary foods for the management of MAM in the country but rather imported from companies outside the country. The objective of the study was to determine the ability of a ready-to-use food supplementation versus corn soya blend (CSB+) to manage MAM. The randomised controlled trial employed three parallel arm approach. The first arm received CSB+ and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counselling, the second arm received ready-to-use food (RUF) and IYCF counselling and the third arm, a control group, received IYCF as standard care for three consecutive months. Results indicated that the overall proportion of children who recovered from MAM was 65.6%. There was a significant difference (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) in the proportion of children who recovered from MAM between the three arms (CSB+, RUF and standard care). Results revealed further a high recovery rate of 83.7% in the RUF arm, followed by 71.9% in the CSB+ arm and 41% in the standard care arm. The risk differences for RUF compared with CSB+ and standard care were 11.8% and 42.7%, respectively. RUFs can be used as an alternative supplement to conventional CSB+ for the management of MAM in children and, thus, has the potential to scale up its use to address the problem of MAM among 6 to 59 months'&#xa0;children.
