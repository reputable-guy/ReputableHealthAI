Study Title: Role of adjuvant Crohn's disease exclusion diet plus enteral nutrition in asymptomatic pediatric Crohn's disease having biochemical activity: A randomized, pilot study.

Study Summary:
Conventional therapy can result in remission in mild-moderate pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). However, some patients experience loss of response to biological drugs despite increased dosage. We planned to determine that CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition offers additional benefits in asymptomatic children with CD having elevated fecal calprotectin. A randomized, open-label, pilot, controlled interventional study was conducted in children with CD while on medical treatment and elevated fecal calprotectin on routine testing. Patients continued their medications and were randomized into a group that received CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition for 12&#xa0;weeks and one that continued a regular diet. Twenty-one patients participated: 11 received CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition and 10, regular diet. Median fecal calprotectin in the CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition decreased in 9/11 to 50% of baseline, remaining practically unchanged in the regular diet, except for two patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Body mass index z-score increased in the CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition. Only 1/11 patients in the CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition group, while 4/10 in the regular diet, experienced clinical relapse (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.149). Only one patient in the CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition, while eight in the regular diet, were considered to need their biologic treatment intensified (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005); 2/11 in the CD exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition had the dose or frequency of the biologic reduced vs. none (0/10) in the regular diet group. The short Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index and anthropometry showed no significant changes in either group. Diet therapy could be a useful addition to medications in children with CD in apparent remission, but elevated fecal calprotectin. Clinical trial number: NCT05034458.
