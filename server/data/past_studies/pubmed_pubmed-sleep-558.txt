Study Title: Submucosal Trans-Septal Suturing Technique After a Septal Extension Graft with Porous High-Density Polyethylene: A Technical Report.

Study Summary:
Porous high-density polyethylene (pHDPE) is an alternative material for a septal extension graft (SEG) in oriental rhinoplasty when autologous cartilage is limited. Although nasal packing (NP) and trans-septal suturing (TSS) techniques are routine procedures to obviate the dead space after septoplasty, they are associated with certain discomforts and complications. To investigate the application of a submucosal trans-septal suturing (STSS) technique after SEG with pHDPE. A prospective study was conducted on 60 female participants who underwent SEG with pHDPE. The participants were randomly divided into the NP group and STSS group. The extra surgical duration of NP and STSS, pain, nasal obstruction, and sleeping disturbance as well as postoperative complications were recorded and compared between groups. No significant difference was found between group NP and group STSS in terms of mean age. The mean extra surgical duration of group STSS was significantly longer than group NP. There were significant higher pains of group NP at 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively, compared with group STSS. The NP group also experienced significantly more nasal obstruction and sleep disturbance within 48h postoperatively compared to the STSS group. There was one infection in each group, minor bleeding in two NP patients, and one STSS patient. There was no major bleeding, hematoma, graft exposure, or septal perforation in both groups. Although STSS needs a longer extra surgical duration than NP, it significantly improves the patient's postoperative comfort with a faster return to normal respiration compared to NP.
