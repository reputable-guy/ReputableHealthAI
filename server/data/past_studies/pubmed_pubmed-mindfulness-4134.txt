Study Title: Prenatal Mindfulness Training and Interoceptive Awareness in Pregnant People at Risk for Hypertensive Disorders.

Study Summary:
In this secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), we sought to examine whether mindfulness training (MT) is associated with change in interoceptive awareness in pregnant people at risk for hypertension using quantitative and qualitative methods. Interoceptive awareness is the perception, regulation, and integration of bodily sensations. Interoceptive awareness increases following MT and has been proposed as a psychosomatic process underlying hypertension outside of pregnancy.Twenty-nine participants (mean age 32 &#xb1; 4 years; 67% White) with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) were enrolled at 16 weeks' gestation (SD = 3) for a RCT assessing the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week phone-delivered MT intervention. Fifteen participants were randomized to MT, whereas 14 were randomized to usual prenatal care. Before and after the intervention, all participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) measure and participated an individual interview, which queried for mind-body changes noticed across the study period.Adjusting for baseline interoceptive awareness and gestational age, participants randomized to MT reported less worry about physical sensations on the MAIA after the intervention compared to those randomized to usual care. Qualitative data corroborated these results; MT participants described improved awareness of body and breath sensations, ability to notice blood pressure changes, non-judgmental observation of thoughts, and improved responses to interpersonal challenges.MT may improve the ability to notice body sensations that arise in pregnancy in a way that promotes healthy responding rather than worry. Results provide support for interoceptive awareness as a potential mechanism through which mindfulness may modulate blood pressure and potentially reduce the prevalence of HDP.
