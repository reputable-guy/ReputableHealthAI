Study Title: Aerobic Exercise Versus Plyometrics in Reducing Anxiety Levels in College Students With Mild Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Study Summary:
Background Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most prevalent&#xa0;mental disorders, characterized by&#xa0;excessive anxiety and worry that affect&#xa0;both mental and physical health. These pervasive illnesses have a crippling effect on people's everyday lives, quality of life, and wellness and are also highly linked with cardiovascular risk factors. Physical activity-based therapies have shown promising effects in treating a range of mental disorders, from psychosis to dementia. Out of many conventional therapies, aerobic exercise and plyometrics have been found to be effective in reducing anxiety levels. Aim This study aims to compare the effectiveness of aerobic exercise and plyometrics in reducing anxiety levels in college students with mild generalized anxiety disorder. Materials and methods A total of 96 subjects were selected for the study&#xa0;using a stratified sampling technique;&#xa0;48 subjects were assigned to the aerobic exercise group (Group A) and 48 to the plyometric group (Group P). Randomization was done using the sealed envelope method. This study includes students aged 18-25 years, both genders, with a body mass index of <30, a Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score of 8-15, and at least six months without practicing any kind of physical activity. The exclusion criteria are subjects with other psychotic disorders, a history of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disease, malignant conditions, neurological disorders, anemia, with comorbid conditions, who were involved in supportive therapy for anxiety such as cognitive behavioral therapy, use of anxiolytic drugs, females with menstrual disorders, and subjects with recent trauma or injuries (fracture, ligament sprain, or muscle strain). The treatment duration for both groups was three days per week for a total of four weeks. Group A consists of five minutes of warm-up, 30 minutes of walking, and five minutes of cool-down, for a total of 40 minutes. Group P consists of warm-up of five minutes, high knees, single leg hop and jump squats of two sets and 10 repetitions for 30 minutes, and a cool-down of five minutes, for a total of 40 minutes. Conclusion The anxiety levels were analyzed using the BAI, revealing that both&#xa0;groups have shown improvements in Beck anxiety scores; however,&#xa0;Group A has shown a comparatively more significant improvement than Group P.
