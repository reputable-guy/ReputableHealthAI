Study Title: Acute effects of a chewable beetroot-based supplement on cognitive performance: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Dietary nitrate (NO) has been shown to be useful as an ergogenic aid with potential applications in health and disease (e.g., blood pressure control). However, there is no consensus about the effects of dietary NOor beetroot (BR) juice supplementation on cognitive function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a single dose of a chewable BR-based supplement on cognitive performance. A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled two-period crossover clinical trial was carried out based on the extension of the CONSORT guidelines for randomized crossover trials. A total of 44 participants (24&#xa0;F; 20&#xa0;M; 32.7 [12.5] years; 66.3 [9.0] kg; 170 [9.2] cm; 22.8 [1.4] kg/m) were randomly allocated to receive first either four BR-based chewable tablets (BR-CT) containing 3&#xa0;g of a Beta vulgaris extract (RedNite) or four tablets of a placebo (maltodextrin). A 4-day washout period was used before crossover. Ninety minutes after ingestion of the treatments, a neuropsychological testing battery was administered in each period. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT05509075. Significant improvements with moderate effect size were found on memory consolidation at the short and long term only after BR-CT supplementation via the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate (+&#x2009;20.69%) and delayed (+&#x2009;12.34%) recalls. Likewise, enhancement on both frontal lobe functions (+&#x2009;2.57%) and cognitive flexibility (+&#x2009;11.16%) were detected after BR-CT. There was no significant change (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) on verbal memory of short-term digits, working memory and information processing speed. Mixed results were found on mood and anxiety through the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1 and STAI-Y2); however, sequence and period effects were seen on STAI-Y2. The acute administration of a chewable BR-based supplement improves certain aspects of cognitive function in healthy females and males, particularly memory capacity and frontal skills.
