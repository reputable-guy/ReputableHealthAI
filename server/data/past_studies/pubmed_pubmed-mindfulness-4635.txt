Study Title: Meditation Using a Mobile App Improves Surgery Trainee Performance: A Simulation-Based Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To primarily investigate: (1) whether a 10-minute instant meditation practice using a mobile app could enhance arthroscopy performance and (2) whether a 10-day app-based meditation could reduce short-term arthroscopic skills deterioration. Orthopaedic residents with no previous experience in arthroscopy and meditation were randomly assigned to groups A, B, and C. After initial standard competency-based arthroscopy training on the simulator on day 1, a pretest was performed via the simulator by all participants to assess their initial level of performance, then groups A and B were required to practice app-based mindfulness meditation 10 min/day for 10 consecutive days while group C did nothing. On day 11, all participants returned to perform a posttest. Before the posttest, the participants in group A practiced app-based meditation (10 minutes), whereas groups B and C had no intervention. In total, 43 participants were included and reached similar level of performance after initial training phase in day 1. On day 11, participants in group A had statistically a better instant arthroscopy performance than group B, with greater total score (mean difference [MD] 3.57; P < .001), less completion time (MD -42.89 seconds; P&#xa0;= .001), shorter camera (MD -23.38 cm; P < .001) and grasper (MD -15.23 cm; P&#xa0;= .002) path length, and less cartilage injury (MD -1.07%; P&#xa0;= .012). Participants in group B had less skills deterioration than group C, with better total score (MD -5.42; P < .001), less completion time (MD 51.96s; P&#xa0;= .002), camera path length (MD 28.41 cm; P&#xa0;= .007), and cartilage injury (MD 1.19%; P&#xa0;= .038). Meditation training using a mobile app enhanced instant simulation-based arthroscopy performance and reduced short-term skills deterioration of orthopaedic residents with no arthroscopy hands-on experience. A meditation using mobile app for clinicians and educators should be incorporated into simulation-based arthroscopy curriculums and perhaps clinical settings to improve arthroscopy performance and mental health of orthopaedic residents without any previous arthroscopy experience.
