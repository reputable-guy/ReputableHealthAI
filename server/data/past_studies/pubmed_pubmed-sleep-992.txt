Study Title: The Effect of Tele-Savvy on Sleep Quality and Insomnia in Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbance is prevalent in caregivers of persons living with dementia (PLwD). Tele-Savvy, a 7-week virtual psychoeducational intervention, enhances caregivers' competence and self-care, and reduces depression. While not explicitly designed to do so, Tele-Savvy can potentially improve caregivers' disturbed sleep. The present study aimed to examine the longitudinal effects of Tele-Savvy on caregivers' sleep quality and insomnia. This was a secondary data analysis of a 3-arm randomized control trial [Tele-Savvy (active treatment), Healthy Living (attention control), and usual care (waitlist control)]. Multilevel mixed modeling with intent-to-treat principles tested for group, time, and group-by-time effects. Effect sizes were estimated for all changes from baseline to the initial 6-month post-intervention point. Following completion of the 6-month post-randomization delay, we examined combined outcomes for Tele-Savvy. Participants (n=137; mean age 64.7 years) were predominantly female (68.6%) and White (68.6%). We found no initial group-by-time effects for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). For the combined Tele-Savvy group, there was a statistically significant improvement in ISI scores across time (p=0.050). The combined Tele-Savvy effect size for PSQI was d=0.126 and ISI was d=0.310. Tele-Savvy resulted in a significant long-term reduction in insomnia symptoms in this sample of caregivers of PLwD and demonstrated a positive trend for improvement in their sleep quality. Since sleep disturbance is so prevalent among caregivers of PLwD, the inclusion of sleep health education into psychoeducation caregiver interventions may yield even better outcomes for caregivers.
