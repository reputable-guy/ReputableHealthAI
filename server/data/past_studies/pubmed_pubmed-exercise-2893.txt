Study Title: The effects of online pilates on the mood and fear of birth of pregnant women: a randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
The Pilates exercise method is applied online to various population groups. This study aimed to determine the effect of online Pilates exercises on depression, anxiety, and fear of childbirth in pregnant women. Our randomized controlled study divided participants into the online pilates group (OPG) and the control group (CG). Pilates exercises were applied to the OPG according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines, while the CG was given a home program. Assessments were made before and after the training.&#xa0;All measurements improved after Online Pilates (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), while there was no change in the control group (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). While initial measurement values were similar in both groups (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05), a statistical difference was observed in favor of OPG with a moderate effect percentage in all results after training (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). These results revealed that eight weeks of online Pilates training could effectively reduce depression, anxiety, and fear of childbirth.Trial registration:Clinical trial registry: NCT05305716.
