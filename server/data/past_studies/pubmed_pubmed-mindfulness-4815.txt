Study Title: Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Intraocular Pressure in Patients With Ocular Hypertension: A Randomized Control Trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT). Parallel arm, single masked, randomized controlled trial. Sixty patients with ocular hypertension and IOP > 21 and < 30 mmHg were recruited at a tertiary eye care centre in India. Thirty patients (group 1) underwent six weeks of one hour daily MBSR sessions, while the other 30 patients (group 2) were waitlisted and kept on follow-up. The primary outcome was change in IOP (&#x394;IOP) after six weeks of MBSR. Secondary outcomes were effect on serum cortisol level, diurnal variation of IOP, vessel perfusion and vessel density on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and quality of life (QOL). At six weeks, a significant decrease in IOP was noted in group 1 (23.05 &#xb1; 1.17 to 19.15 &#xb1; 1.45 mmHg; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001) compared with group 2 (22.55 &#xb1; 0.98 mmHg to 22.37 &#xb1; 1.07 mmHg; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.107). The &#x394;IOP was significantly greater in group 1 (3.93 &#xb1; 1.47) than group 2 (0.17 &#xb1; 0.58; P = .001). The diurnal fluctuation of IOP decreased in group 1 (4.87 &#xb1; 1.13 mmHg to 2.73 &#xb1; 0.98 mmHg; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001) as compared with group 2 (4.50 &#xb1; 0.86 mmHg to 4.30 &#xb1; 0.83 mmHg; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.227). Significant improvement in vessel perfusion, vessel density, and flux index was noted on OCTA in group 1 compared with group 2. Group 1 showed a significant decrease (P &#x2264; .001) in serum cortisol level and an improved QOL (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001). Mindfulness-based stress reduction was associated with a significant decrease in IOP and serum cortisol, along with an improvement in optic nerve head perfusion and QOL. Mindfulness-based stress reduction can be considered as a potential treatment option in the management of OHT.
