Study Title: Efficacy and safety of gefapixant in women with chronic cough and cough-induced stress urinary incontinence: a phase 3b, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Approximately two-thirds of women with chronic cough have cough-induced stress urinary incontinence (CSUI). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in reducing CSUI episodes in women with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. This phase 3b, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 90 sites in 12 countries enrolled women aged 18 years or older who had chronic cough for at least 1 year, a diagnosis of refractory or unexplained chronic cough, a cough severity visual analogue scale score of 40 mm or more (100 mm maximum), and CSUI for 3 months or more. Participants were randomised 1:1 to oral gefapixant or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was percentage change from baseline in daily CSUI episodes (7-day average) at week 12. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04193176). From May 10, 2020, to Sept 2, 2022, 375 participants were randomised to and treated with gefapixant 45 mg twice daily (n=185) or placebo (n=190). Mean age was 56&#xb7;4 years (SD 11&#xb7;4), with mean chronic cough duration of 5&#xb7;2 years (SD 6&#xb7;6) and SUI duration of 4&#xb7;0 years (SD 5&#xb7;9). Least-squares mean percentage change from baseline in daily CSUI episodes was -52&#xb7;8% (95% CI -58&#xb7;4 to -47&#xb7;1%) for gefapixant and -41&#xb7;1% (-46&#xb7;7 to -35&#xb7;4%) for placebo (estimated treatment difference: -11&#xb7;7% [95% CI -19&#xb7;7 to -3&#xb7;7]; p=0&#xb7;004). 129 (70%) of 185 participants who received gefapixant and 71 (37%) of 190 participants who received placebo had at least one adverse event. Safety and tolerability were consistent with previous trials of gefapixant; the most frequent adverse events were taste related. Gefapixant 45 mg twice daily is the first treatment to show efficacy versus placebo in reducing CSUI episodes in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough.
