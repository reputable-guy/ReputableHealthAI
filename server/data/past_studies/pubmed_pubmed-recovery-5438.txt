Study Title: Can heartbeat recovery be improved with terminal non-cardioplegic warm blood perfusion prior to aortic unclamping in single-clamp technique coronary artery bypass surgery? A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study is to investigate whether the use of antegrade perfusion with terminal non-cardioplegic warm blood (TNWB) before aortic unclamping in single-clamp technique coronary artery bypass has a positive impact on intraoperative heartbeat recovery. Between December 2022 and May 2023, 40 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass using single-clamp technique were randomized into one of two groups: the TNWB group received an antegrade perfusion with TNWB before removing the aortic cross-clamp (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20), while the control group did not receive (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). The time intervals between coronary perfusion and the onset of the first heartbeats and sinus rhythms, occurrences of spontaneous sinus rhythm, intraoperative defibrillation requirements, as well as postoperative CK-MB and troponin T levels were recorded and subjected to analysis. In the TNWB group, the median onset of the first heartbeats after the initiation of coronary perfusion was 34&#xa0;s (4-100), while in the control group, it was 90&#xa0;s (15-340) (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The median onset of the sinus rhythms was 100&#xa0;s (28-290) in the TNWB group and was 132&#xa0;s (45-350) in the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.023). The occurrence of intraoperative arrhythmias was 15% in the TNWB group compared to 50% in the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), and the incidence for internal defibrillation was 5% in the TNWB group and was 30% in the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037). The TNWB group showed the median CK-MB levels at 6&#xa0;h postoperative was 14.10 ng/mL (9.78-19.26), compared to 18.31 ng/mL (13.98-23.80) in the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045). During single clamp coronary artery bypass, administration TNWB into the aortic root before aortic unclamping has the potential to enhance heartbeat recovery, as evidenced by the shortened time to the initial heartbeat and the establishment of sinus beats following coronary perfusion.
