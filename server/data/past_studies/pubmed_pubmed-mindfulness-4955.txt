Study Title: A randomized trial comparing group mindfulness-based cognitive therapy with group supportive sex education and therapy for the treatment of female sexual interest/arousal disorder.

Study Summary:
Sexual interest/arousal disorder (SIAD) is the most prevalent sexual dysfunction in women. Our goal was to compare (a) group mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) plus sex education with (b) group supportive sex education and therapy (STEP) for women with SIAD.Eight-session treatments were delivered weekly and participants completed the measures of sexual desire and arousal, sexual distress, relationship satisfaction, rumination, and global impressions of change, at baseline, immediately posttreatment, and at 6- and 12-month posttreatment. Of 148 women who consented, 70 were randomized to MBCT (mean age 39.3 &#xb1; 13.2 years) and 78 were randomized to STEP (mean age 37.9 &#xb1; 12.2 years).Sexual desire and arousal significantly improved at each time point relative to baseline, with large effect sizes (= -1.29 to -1.60), and similarly for MBCT and STEP. Sexual distress also improved at each time point with large effect sizes (= 0.83-1.17), and more so for MBCT relative to STEP. Relationship satisfaction significantly improved (= -0.17 to -0.20), and rumination about sex improved significantly in both arms, with medium effect sizes (= 0.42-0.69), with both outcomes responding more to MBCT. About half the participants across both treatments reported moderate or great improvements in global indicators of desire and overall sexuality.Results support the efficacy of both group MBCT and group supportive sex education for improving symptoms of SIAD with 12-month retention of improvements.
