Study Title: An Examination into the Effects of a Nutraceutical Supplement on Cognition, Stress, Eye Health, and Skin Satisfaction in Adults with Self-Reported Cognitive Complaints: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
: Dietary quality and the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods have been shown to protect against memory decline. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study aimed to investigate the effects of a nutritional supplement on changes in cognitive performance.: In adults aged 40 to 70 years with subjective memory complaints, participants were randomly allocated to take a supplement containing vitamin E, astaxanthin, and grape juice extract daily for 12 weeks or a matching placebo. The primary outcomes comprised changes in cognitive tasks assessing episodic memory, working memory, and verbal memory. Secondary and exploratory measures included changes in the speed of information processing, attention, and self-report measures of memory, stress, and eye and skin health. Moreover, changes in plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, malondialdehyde, tumor-necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, and interleukin-6 were measured, along with changes in skin carotenoid concentrations.: Compared to the placebo, nutritional supplementation was associated with larger improvements in one primary outcome measure comprising episodic memory (= 0.037), but not for working memory (= 0.418) or verbal learning (= 0.841). Findings from secondary and exploratory outcomes demonstrated that the nutraceutical intake was associated with larger improvements in the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (= 0.022), increased plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (= 0.030), decreased plasma malondialdehyde (= 0.040), and increased skin carotenoid concentrations (= 0.006). However, there were no group differences in changes in the remaining outcome measures.: Twelve weeks of supplementation with a nutritional supplement was associated with improvements in episodic memory and several biological markers associated with cognitive health. Future research will be essential to extend and validate the current findings.
