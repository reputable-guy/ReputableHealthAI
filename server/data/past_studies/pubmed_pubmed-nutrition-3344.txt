Study Title: Acacia fiber or probiotic supplements to relieve gastrointestinal complaints in patients with constipation-predominant IBS: a 4-week randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled intervention trial.

Study Summary:
To date, no adequate treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation complaints (IBS-C) is available. Fibers with prebiotic properties and probiotic compounds have shown promise in relieving IBS-C-related complaints. We aimed to determine the effects of a 4-week intervention with either an Acacia fiber (AF) with prebiotic properties or a probiotic Bifidobacterium Lactis (BLa80) supplement, compared to a control supplement, on stool pattern, IBS symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL), in IBS-C individuals. A parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving 180 subjects meeting the ROME IV criteria for IBS-C was conducted. Following a 4-week observation period, subjects received either AF (10&#xa0;g), Probiotic BLa80 (4&#xa0;g; 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10CFU/g) or a maltodextrin placebo (10&#xa0;g) daily for 4 weeks. Subjects reported daily information on stool pattern and gastrointestinal complaints. Before and after each 4-week period, questionnaires on symptom severity, constipation symptoms, anxiety and depression and QoL were completed. Stool mass was measured for 5-days before and after the intervention. Stool frequency significantly improved in the AF and Probiotic BLa80 groups compared to placebo (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02, respectively). Probiotic BLa80 showed a significant reduction in IBS symptom severity (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), for AF a trend towards decreased constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.10) was observed. No significant changes in stool consistency, stool mass or QoL measures were observed between the AF and Probiotic BLa80 compared to placebo. Daily dietary supplementation with Acacia fiber and probiotic supplements might help IBS-C patients by relieving IBS-related complaints compared to a placebo supplement.
