Study Title: Comparative effectiveness of mindfulness and mindful eating programmes among low-income overweight women in primary health care: A randomised controlled pragmatic study with psychological, biochemical, and anthropometric outcomes.

Study Summary:
Obesity is a chronic and multifactorial disease, with growing rates in the last 50 years worldwide, reaching pandemic levels. It is a major public health problem and is difficult to treat. Different approaches have been used to improve this scenario, including mindfulness-based interventions to enhance dietary behaviour and nutritional status. We compared the effectiveness of a 10-week mindful eating programme with that of a 10-week mindfulness programme and of a no-treatment control group. The sample was composed of adult, low-income women with a body mass index (BMI)&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;25 to&#xa0;<&#xa0;40 receiving primary health care in S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil. The participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;284) were randomised into 3 groups: the control, mindfulness, and mindful eating. We took anthropometric and body composition measurements, applied psychometric measures, and performed biochemical tests at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and after 3 months. We estimated the regression coefficients among the analysis of adherent participants (per protocol: PP) and among those of all participants randomised to treatment (intention-to-treat: ITT) in addition to multiple imputation (MI). Both groups showed improvement in eating behaviour and reduction of binge eating both in the post-intervention and follow-up periods, but without significant changes in weight or most of the biological tests. Those in the mindful eating programme performed slightly better than those in the mindfulness and control groups in terms of improving eating behaviour and reducing binge eating among low-income overweight women.
