Study Title: The Immediate Effects of a Standardized Kettlebell Swing Protocol on Lumbar Paraspinal Muscle Function: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Hanney, WJ, Perez, A, Collado, G, Palmer, AC, Wilson, AT, Richardson, RM, and Kolber, MJ. J Strength Cond Res 38(11): 1854-1859, 2024-Kettlebell swings (KBSs) are commonly used to target the lumbar erector spinae and lower body musculature. This exercise exhibits distinct loading properties that requires cyclical contraction of the trunk extensors and posterior chain, potentially explaining its novel influence on muscle contractility. Tensiomyography (TMG) is a reliable, noninvasive, passive technique that may be used to examine muscular fatigue produced by exercises such as KBSs. The purpose of this randomized control trial was to determine the extent of muscle fatigue in the lumbar erector spinae musculature following the performance of a previously published high-intensity interval KBS protocol. Forty-one adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years were recruited. Inclusion criteria included subjects with no recent history of low back pain and clearance by the physical activity readiness questionnaire. Subjects were randomly allocated to either a KBS group ( n = 21) or a control group (CON; n = 20) who only performed the unloaded warm-up. Subjects were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 24-hours postintervention for bilateral erector spinae fatigue, measured by 5 TMG parameters (Dm, Tc, Tr, Td, and Ts). The results were evaluated through a 2 &#xd7; 3 (group &#xd7; time) repeated-measures analysis of variance. The level of significance was set at p &#x2264; 0.05. There was no significant difference in lumbar erector spinae fatigue, measured by the 5 TMG parameters ( p &#x2265; 0.079), following the interval KBS protocol in comparison with the CON group at 3 assessment periods. A high-intensity interval KBS protocol failed to produce significant differences in erector spinae fatigue compared with the control group that did not perform a KBS. These findings warrant further investigation into muscle fatigue produced with higher intensity protocols and possibly suggest, depending on the programming goals, the need for an alternate KBS training parameters.
