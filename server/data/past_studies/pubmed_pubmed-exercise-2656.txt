Study Title: A comparison of continuous, interval, and accumulated workouts with equalized exercise volume: excess post-exercise oxygen consumption in women.

Study Summary:
Despite the well-known health benefits of exercise, women's participation in exercise is low worldwide. As women are at risk of developing various chronic diseases as they age, suggesting effective exercise methods that can maximize energy consumption is needed to prevent such conditions. Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) can maximize energy consumption. In this crossover, randomized controlled trial, we aimed to compare the EPOC for different exercise modalities including continuous exercise (CE), interval exercise (IE), and accumulated exercise (AE) that spent the homogenized energy expenditure during exercise in healthy women. Forty-four participants (age, 36.09&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.73 years) were recruited and randomly allocated to three groups. The intensity of each modality was set as follows: CE was performed for 30&#xa0;min at 60% peak oxygen uptake (VOpeak). IE was performed once for 2&#xa0;min at 80% VOpeak, followed by 3&#xa0;min at 80% VOpeak, and 1&#xa0;min at 40% VOpeak, for a total of six times over 26&#xa0;min. AE was performed for 10&#xa0;min with a 60% VOpeak and was measured thrice a day. During exercise, energy metabolism was higher for IE and CE than that for AE. However, this was reversed for AE during EPOC. Consequently, the greatest energy metabolism was shown for AE during total time (exercise and EPOC). By encouraging regular exercises, AE can help maintain and improve body composition by increasing compliance with exercise participation, given its short exercise times, and by efficiently increasing energy consumption through the accumulation of EPOC.
