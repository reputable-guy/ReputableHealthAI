Study Title: Safety and efficacy of subthreshold micropulse yellow laser for persistent subretinal fluid after scleral bucking a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Persistent subretinal fluid (PSF) after scleral bucking of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment may delay recovery and affect the final visual quality, but with no effective treatment. This study firstly investigated the safety and efficacy of 577&#xa0;nm yellow subthreshold micropulse laser (SML) on PSF after scleral bucking surgery. This double-masked randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 2020 to October 2022 at Chongqing Aier Eye Hospital. Participants with PSF last for 1&#xa0;month after scleral bucking surgery with break closed and retina reattachment were recruitment. These participants were treated by 577&#xa0;nm yellow SML or sham treatment. Funduscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume change, best corrected vision acuity (BCVA) and visual field test were evaluated for six mouths follow-up. A total of 24 participants were randomized into SML group or Sham group equally. Compared with Sham group, the OCT volume within 6&#xa0;mm of macular fovea was significantly less in SML group 6&#xa0;months after therapy (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). There were no statistically significant differences of OCT volume at 1, 2 and 3&#xa0;months from baseline between groups. BCVA of ETDRS letters had no statistically significant difference. Pattern Standard Deviation amelioration (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039) had statistically significance in SML group compared with Sham group. There were no complications in the 2 groups. These preliminary findings suggest that 577&#xa0;nm yellow SML therapy could accelerate PSF absorption after scleral bucking surgery.Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry No. ChiCTR2000037838, 02/09/2020, https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=51885 .
