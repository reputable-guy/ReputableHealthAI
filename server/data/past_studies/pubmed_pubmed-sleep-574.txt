Study Title: Comparative evaluation of the sleep quality metrics between a cardboard bed and a camp cot: a randomized controlled crossover study.

Study Summary:
Health-beneficial emergency bedding has become increasingly important for dealing with natural disasters such as the anticipated Nankai Trough earthquake in Japan. When the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred, cardboard beds were provided to evacuees. However, there were concerns about lower back pain and sleep disturbances, as cardboard beds offer insufficient pressure distribution. This study aimed to compare the effects of cardboard beds with those of foldable camp cots on sleep quality. A randomized controlled crossover study involving 20 healthy participants aged 18-45 years was conducted between June 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to sleep for one night on a camp cot and for another night on a cardboard bed, with a minimum three-day washout period between the two nights. Body pressure distribution and sleep metrics obtained from polysomnography (PSG) and questionnaires were compared between the two-bed types (< 0.05). The camp cot exhibited better body pressure distribution than a cardboard bed, leading to improved sleep satisfaction, bedding comfort, and reduced morning sleepiness. Nevertheless, polysomnography revealed no notable differences in sleep metrics or sleep architecture between the two types of beds. Our findings indicate that cardboard beds have lower pressure dispersion capabilities than camp cots, leading to an increased number of position changes during sleep. Additionally, subjective sleep quality, such as alertness on waking, sleep comfort, and sleep satisfaction, was lower for cardboard beds, suggesting that camp cots might offer a more comfortable bedding option for evacuees. However, there were no discernible differences between the two-bed types in terms of objective sleep metrics derived from PSG. The potential for sleep disturbances caused by lower back pain from a hard mattress has been noted, and it is possible that a single night's experience in healthy individuals might not be enough for sleep issues to manifest.
