Study Title: Effect of fezolinetant on sleep disturbance and impairment during treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.

Study Summary:
To analyse the effect of fezolinetant on patient-reported sleep disturbance and impairment in individuals with vasomotor symptoms (VMS) using pooled data from the SKYLIGHT 1 and 2 studies. The SKYLIGHT studies were phase-3, double-blind investigations. Individuals (&#x2265;40-&#x2264;65&#xa0;years) who were assigned female at birth and seeking treatment of/relief from moderate-to-severe VMS were enrolled. Participants were randomised to receive placebo, fezolinetant 30&#xa0;mg, or fezolinetant 45&#xa0;mg during a 12-week treatment period. Sleep assessments: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance - Short Form 8b (PROMIS SD SF 8b), PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment - Short Form 8a (PROMIS SRI SF 8a), and Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity in SD (PGI-C SD and PGI-S SD). Assessments were completed at baseline (except PGI-C SD), weeks 4 and 12. Overall, 1022 individuals were randomised and took &#x2265;1 dose of study drug. PROMIS SD SF 8b results showed that improvements in sleep disturbance were observed for fezolinetant 30 and 45&#xa0;mg versus placebo (week 12, least squares [LS] mean differences: -0.6 [95&#xa0;% confidence interval [CI]: -1.7, 0.4] for 30&#xa0;mg and -1.5 [-2.5, -0.5] for 45&#xa0;mg). Similar improvements in sleep impairment were reported using the PROMIS SRI SF 8a (week 12, LS mean differences: -1.1 [95&#xa0;% CI: -2.1, -0.1] for 30&#xa0;mg and&#xa0;-1.3 [-2.3, -0.3] for 45&#xa0;mg). For PGI-C SD at week 12, 33.6&#xa0;% (98/292 participants) of the placebo group felt much/moderately better versus 40.1&#xa0;% (110/274) and 51.0&#xa0;% (154/302) of the fezolinetant 30&#xa0;mg and 45&#xa0;mg groups, respectively. For PGI-S SD at week 12, 44.0&#xa0;% (129/293) of the placebo group had severe/moderate problems versus 41.1&#xa0;% (113/275) and 36.6&#xa0;% (111/303) of the fezolinetant 30&#xa0;mg and 45&#xa0;mg groups, respectively. The 12-week timeframe for this analysis was limited by the length of the placebo-controlled period. Fezolinetant had a beneficial effect on four measures of sleep disturbance and impairment following treatment for VMS.
