Study Title: Effect of three group interventions on psychosocial functioning in adolescents exposed to interpersonal violence in Chile: A pilot clinical trial.

Study Summary:
In Chile demand for specialist care following exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV) in youth far exceeds capacity. Group interventions may improve access to care for youth. To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of two low-intensity group interventions: Trama Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT); Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT); and treatment as usual, Art therapy-based support (ATBS). Outcomes measured were post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression, interpersonal functioning and affect regulation. Participants were 67 Chilean youth aged 13-17&#xa0;years, victims of IPV on a waiting list to receive specialist individual intervention. Using a randomised controlled trial design, participants were randomly assigned to one of the interventions. Self-report measures were completed at 5 timepoints between baseline and follow up eight weeks after intervention ended. Dropout rates and attendance were also analysed. TF-CBT showed significant decreases for PTSD (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.91) and depression (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.77) symptoms, sustained at follow-up with affect regulation problems also showing significant decrease from baseline (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.43). IPT showed significant decreases in PTSD symptoms (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.64) and affect regulation problems (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.66), both sustained at follow-up. ATBS showed statistically significant decrease for PTSD (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.79) and interpersonal problems (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.65) but only change in PTSD was sustained at follow-up. There were no significant differences in dropout or attendance between the interventions. Group interventions provide a viable and effective first-phase option for reducing psychological distress in IPV-exposed youth in high-demand contexts. Effectiveness may be further improved through the more active involvement of parents and carers.
