Study Title: The Effects of a Guided Mindful Walk on Mental Health in University Students.

Study Summary:
College campuses in the United States are experiencing high levels of mental distress without adequate psychological resources to address the need. In addition, the majority of university students do not meet the physical activity guidelines for mental and physical health. Effective and time efficient resources are needed to address poor mental health and low physical activity among university students on college campuses. Mindful walking may be a promising solution. The purpose was to 1) measure change in mental health and 2) estimate physical activity from participation in a guided mindful walk in a diverse student sample. Students participated in a mindful walking route which included seven stops (0.85 miles) during the Spring 2022 semester. Undergraduate students (= 44) were mean &#xb1; SD age 20.9 &#xb1; 3.8 years and 68% female. Validated surveys were given pre- and post-participation measuring mental health constructs of state mindfulness (Toronto Mindfulness Scale; TMS), state anxiety (visual analogue scale), and state stress (Short Stress State Questionnaire; SSSQ). Physical activity was estimated via steps on a Yamax pedometer worn at the hip. After the guided mindful walk, total state mindfulness score significantly improved (mean &#xb1; SD) (pre: 27.5 &#xb1; 8.2, post: 32.8 &#xb1; 9.5;< 0.001); state anxiety significantly decreased (pre: 3.7 &#xb1; 2.4, post: 2.4 &#xb1; 2;< 0.0001) and total state stress score was reduced (pre: 66.1 &#xb1; 10.7, post: 63.4 &#xb1; 8.3;= 0.03). Physical activity averaged 1,726 &#xb1; 159 steps. Completion of a guided mindful walk can reduce anxiety and stress, while increasing mindfulness among university students.
