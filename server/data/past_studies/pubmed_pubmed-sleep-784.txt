Study Title: A brief mindfulness-based intervention, sleep quality, sleep duration, and fatigue among nurses: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention in improving sleep duration, sleep quality, and fatigue among Jordanian nurses. A randomized controlled trial was used to conduct this study. Data from 123 nurses (60 nurses in the interventional group and 63 nurses in the control group) were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome measures were compared between the intervention and control groups using repeated measure MANOVA to assess changes in sleep duration, sleep quality, and fatigue over time. The results showed that there was a statistically significant multivariate effect of the intervention on the linear combination of the dependent variables (sleep duration, sleep quality, and fatigue) (V = 0.23, F (3,&#x2009;119)&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.02, p < .001) with Partial &#x3b7;of 0.23. Follow-up analysis showed that the intervention group had lower sleep disturbances (Mean difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;-6.53, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-7.79 to -5.26) and less fatigue (Mean difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;-13.36, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-17.24 to -9.47) than the control group. The current study showed that the mindfulness-based intervention effectively addresses sleep quality and fatigue in nurses, which in turn is expected to positively impact the health care system. Mindfulness-based interventions effectively address sleep quality and fatigue associated with nurses' job performance and outcomes. Implementing brief mindfulness-based interventions is crucial as they can be self-implemented and fit into nurses' busy schedules.
