Study Title: Very early and early nutrition in children with pancreatitis-A randomised trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of our study was to assess the impact of the very early introduction of refeeding on the course of acute pancreatitis (AP) in children. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of nutrition on inflammatory markers, including cytokines. This prospective randomised study was conducted in three university hospitals in Poland. Patients, aged 1-18 years with AP, were randomised into two groups: A-refeeding within 24&#x2009;h of hospital admission (very early), and B-refeeding at least 24&#x2009;h after admission (early nutrition). The severity of AP was assessed after 48&#x2009;h. The serum concentrations of four cytokines (tumour necrosis factor &#x3b1; [TNF&#x3b1;], interleukin-1&#x3b2; [IL-1&#x3b2;], interleukin-6 [IL-6] and interleukin-8 [IL-8]) and C-reactive protein, as well as the activity of amylase, lipase and aminotransferases, were measured during the first 3 days of hospitalisation. A total of 94 children were recruited to participate in the study. The statistical analysis included 75 patients with mild pancreatitis: 42-group A and 33-group B. The two groups did not differ in the length of hospitalisation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22), AP symptoms or results of laboratory tests. Analysis of cytokine levels was conducted for 64 children: 38-group A and 26-group B. We did not find a difference in concentrations of the measured cytokines, except for IL-1&#x3b2; on the third day of hospitalisation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). The time of initiation of oral nutrition within 24&#x2009;h (very early) or after 24&#x2009;h (early) from the beginning of hospitalisation had no impact on the length of hospitalisation, concentrations of TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6 and IL-8, activity of amylase and lipase or occurrence of symptoms in children with mild AP.
