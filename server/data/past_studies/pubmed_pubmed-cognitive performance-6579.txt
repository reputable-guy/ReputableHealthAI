Study Title: Effects of listening to music and practicing physical exercise on functional and cognitive aspects in institutionalized older adults with dementia: Pilot study.

Study Summary:
Determine the effects of listening to music and practicing physical exercise on functional and cognitive aspects in institutionalized older adults with dementia. A randomized clinical pilot trial was conducted involving 17 institutionalized older adults with moderate to advanced dementia. The participants were allocated to two groups: training with music (TWM) and training without music (TWtM). The TWtM group performed light exercises with a focus on mobility. The TWM group was initially submitted to a cognitive stimulus with music, followed by the same exercises as those performed in the TWtM Group. Sessions were held once a week for 12 weeks. Functional and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. No significant differences in functional or cognitive performance were found between groups or evaluation times. Both groups maintained their performances after 12 weeks. Listening to music combined with physical exercise training did not exert an effect on functional or cognitive performance in institutionalized older adults with moderate to advanced dementia.
