Study Title: Chronic exercise and neuropsychological function in healthy young adults: a randomised controlled trial investigating a running intervention.

Study Summary:
Despite the well-known physical and mental health benefits of regular exercise, many of the world's population, including healthy young adults, grossly undershoot recommended physical activity levels. Chronic exercise has potential to improve cognitive performance and affect in most age groups. However, there is currently a poverty of relevant research in young adults, especially randomised controlled trials. To address this, the current research investigated the effects of a running intervention on neuropsychological function (cognition and affect) in young adults. We predicted that following a running intervention, neuropsychological performance would improve alongside increases in aerobic fitness. Thirty-two healthy young adult university students were randomised (using a 3:1 ratio) into an intervention or control group, with the intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) asked to run for 30&#xa0;min three times a week over a 6-week period and the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) asked to maintain their current level of exercise over a 6-week period. We assessed fitness, cognitive performance, affect and running enjoyment at baseline and follow-up, and runners recorded the environmental conditions of their runs. Repeated measures ANCOVAs failed to find any significant effects of the running intervention on fitness or the neuropsychological measures. Anecdotal evidence supported running environment and enjoyment as potentially relevant factors. The failure to find any fitness improvements, which likely underpins the lack of neuropsychological improvements, highlights the importance of monitoring exercise sessions. Coupled with other insights gained from this trial, this article may prove useful towards future endeavours to develop exercise interventions beneficial to young adults.TRN: ACTRN12621000242820, Date of registration: 08/03/2021.
