Study Title: Baduanjin for ischemic heart failure with mildly reduced/preserved ejection fraction (BEAR Trial): A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
While Baduanjin, a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise, has shown potential health benefits, its efficacy in improving outcomes for heart failure patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF) has not been well documented. We aimed to investigate the adjunctive impact of Baduanjin on exercise capacity and quality of life for HFmrEF/HFpEF. Patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF were enrolled in this multicenter randomized clinical trial. All participants were randomized to conventional cardiac rehabilitation with or without an additional 12-week Baduanjin exercise. The primary endpoint was the distance covered in a 6-min walk test (6MWD), while key secondary outcomes included quality of life measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and cardiopulmonary function including anaerobic threshold (VOAT). A total of 120 patients were enrolled, and 109 completed all session and tests. The mean age of the 120 patients was 60.5 years (SD, 9.21 years), and 23 (19.2%) were women. The Baduanjin group exhibited a 6.14% improvement in 6MWD compared to a 1.32% improvement in the control group (median improvement, 25.0&#xa0;vs. 5.0&#xa0;m; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) at 12th week. The VOAT increased by 25.87% in the Baduanjin group versus 3.94% in the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Quality of life also significantly improved in the Baduanjin group as indicated by MLHFQ score changes (-16.8% vs. -3.99%; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Adding Baduanjin to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with ischemic HFmrEF or HFpEF are generally safe and could provide significant improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life.
