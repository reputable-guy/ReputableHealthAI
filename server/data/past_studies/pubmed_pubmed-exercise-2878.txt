Study Title: Visceral fat mass dynamics in a 2-year randomized STrength versus ENdurance training trial in people with obesity.

Study Summary:
To compare the effectiveness of strength versus endurance training on reducing visceral fat in individuals with obesity. For the STrength versus ENdurance (STEN) 24-month randomized clinical trial, we assigned 239 participants with abdominal obesity to either strength or endurance training (two to three times a week, 60&#x2009;min/training session) in addition to standard nutritional counselling to promote a healthy diet. Changes in abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area quantified by magnetic resonance imaging after 12&#x2009;months were defined as a primary endpoint. Participants (aged 44&#x2009;years, 74% women, body mass index: 37&#x2009;kg/m, mean VAT volume: 4050&#x2009;cm) had an approximately 50% retention rate and a 30% good training programme adherence at 12&#x2009;months. There was no difference between strength and endurance training in VAT volume dynamics after 12 and 24&#x2009;months (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.13). Only in the good adherence group did we find a trend for reduced VAT volume in both training regimens. Independently of the exercise programme, there was a continuous trend for moderate loss of abdominal subcutaneous AT volume, body fat mass, body mass index and improved parameters of insulin sensitivity. Although parameters of physical fitness improved upon both exercise interventions, the dynamics of resting energy expenditure, glucose and lipid metabolism parameters were not different between the intervention groups and did not significantly improve during the 2-year trial (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05). Despite heterogeneous individual training responses, strength and endurance training neither affected VAT volume nor key secondary endpoints differently.
