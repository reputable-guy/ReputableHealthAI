Study Title: Indices of Sleep Health Are Associated With Timing and Duration of Eating in Young Adults.

Study Summary:
Limited data exist examining whether timing and/or duration of eating behaviors throughout the day affect sleep health. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between eating behaviors and sleep in young adults without chronic diseases or conditions. This was a cross-sectional study using 7 days of baseline data from a randomized crossover trial. Participants included 52 young adults. The study took place in West Lafayette, Indiana, between April 2017 and May&#xa0;2018. Timing and duration of eating were assessed via 3 nonconsecutive, 24-hour dietary recalls. Bedtime, wake time, total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset were measured over 7 days via wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries. Two-way analyses of variance were applied to assess group differences based on timing of consumption (early vs late eating) and duration of eating (long: >13 hours, short: <11 hours, or standard: 11-13 hours) with post-hoc pairwise comparisons. Main effects of timing of consumption, but not duration of eating, were detected for wake time, bedtime, and sleep efficiency (all, P < .05). Specifically, participants with later eating patterns that included breakfast skipping had later wake times and later bedtimes than those with earlier eating patterns. In addition, those who had later eating patterns that included breakfast skipping and nighttime eating experienced lower sleep efficiency (mean [SE], 77.0% [2.3%]) vs those who consumed breakfast and no nighttime eating (mean [SE], 84.6% [1.4%]; P < .001) and those who skipped breakfast but had no nighttime eating (mean [SE], 84.2% [2.5]; P < .05). Those who consumed breakfast but also had nighttime eating had a mean (SE) sleep efficiency of 82.4% (1.4%) (P&#xa0;= .09). The timing of eating was associated with sleep-wake onset and sleep efficiency. This study provides the preliminary characterization of eating behaviors relative to sleep-wake cycles and highlights the need for experimental studies to understand whether manipulating the timing of eating occasions to better align with sleep-wake cycles could improve sleep health.
