Study Title: The combined effect of physical exercise, pranayama, and diet on fatigue in adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy continue to experience significant fatigue, which affects their quality of life. The present study aims to evaluate the combined effect of comprehensive physical exercise, pranayama (regulated breathing practices of yoga), and dietary support intervention on fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Non-advanced adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;52) were randomized into the intervention group (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;26) or control group (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;26). Fatigue assessment was done using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Scale (version 4) at baseline and after 3 months. The intervention group participants practiced physical exercise, slow-paced pranayama and supplemented their diet with an intake of 100 g of millet protein powder (MPP), commonly known as "Sattu" in India. The control group received standard medical care. A total of 39 patients (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;13 in the intervention and N&#x2009;=&#x2009;26 in the control group) were included in the statistical analysis. Within the intervention group, a statistically significant reduction in fatigue (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) with a large effect size (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.1) was observed. There was no statistically significant reduction in fatigue within the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36). The group comparison showed a statistically significant reduction in post-scores of fatigue (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001) in the intervention group as compared to the control group with a moderate effect size (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.1). No unintended adverse effects related to the intervention were observed. The results suggest the potential role of integrated physical exercise, pranayama, and dietary support in reducing fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Further validation with a larger sample size is required. CTRI/2022/04/041717 [Registered prospectively on 07/04/2022].
