Study Title: Nutraceutical Supplementation as a Potential Non-Drug Treatment for Fibromyalgia: Effects on Lipid Profile, Oxidative Status, and Quality of Life.

Study Summary:
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic syndrome of unknown etiology, although many studies point to inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered mitochondrial metabolism as some of the cornerstones of this disease. Despite its socioeconomic importance and due to the difficulties in diagnosis, there are no effective treatments. However, the use of non-drug treatments is increasingly becoming a recommended strategy. In this context, the effects of supplementation of FM patients with an olive (poly)phenol, vitamin C, and vitamin B preparation were investigated in this work, analyzing complete blood count, biochemical, lipid, and coagulation profiles, and inflammation and oxidation status in blood samples. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in the etiology of FM, a proteomic study was also performed to investigate the mechanisms of action of the supplement. Our results show that the nutraceutical lowers the lipid profile, namely cholesterol, and improves the oxidative status of patients as well as their quality of life, suggesting that this product could be beneficial in the co-treatment of FM.
