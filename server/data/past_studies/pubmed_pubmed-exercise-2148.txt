Study Title: Effects of Integrating Stair Climbing-Based Exercise Snacks Into the Campus on Feasibility, Perceived Efficacy, and Participation Perspectives in Inactive Young Adults: A&#xa0;Randomized Mixed-Methods Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
This 6-week pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility, perceived efficacy, and participation perspectives of a university campus stair climbing-based exercise snack (ES) intervention and to compare it to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). Healthy, young, inactive adults (age: 21.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.3&#x2009;years, BMI: 22.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.6&#x2009;kg/m) were randomly assigned to three groups (ES, MICT, and Control [CON]). ES (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14, 6 females) and MICT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13, 9 females) groups performed three sessions per week over 6&#x2009;weeks, while the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15, 9 females) maintained their habitual lifestyle. ES involved 3&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;~30&#x2009;s 'all-out' stair-climbing (6 flights, total 126 steps and 18.9&#x2009;m elevation) bouts separated by >&#x2009;1&#x2009;h rest, and MICT involved 40&#x2009;min stationary cycling at 60%-70% HR. Mixed linear effect models were used to explore within and between-group differences, and the change in magnitude was determined using mean difference (MD), 95% confidence interval (CI), and Cohen's d effect size. Fourteen participants also completed post-intervention semi-structured interviews. Retention rates of 93% (ES, 14/15), 93% (MICT, 13/14), and 100% (CON, 15/15) were achieved from baseline to post-assessments, with compliance (participants' attendance to scheduled ES sessions) of 97% (733/756 sessions) and 93% (217/234 sessions) in ES and MICT, respectively. No significant differences were found between ES and MICT for future intentions (4.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.4 and 5.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.9), enjoyment (PACES, 89.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;16.4 and 94.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.9), and satisfaction. A significant group&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;time interaction was found in the quality of life and perceived stress. ES and MICT significantly increased the quality of life by 8% (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.5 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3, 10.7], Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.64) and 6% (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.6 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9, 8.2], Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.88) compared to baseline, whereas CON experienced a significant decrease (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-7.9 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-14.4, -1.6], Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.56). ES significantly decreased perceived stress by 7% (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.6 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-8.9, -0.3], Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58), while MICT (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.0 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.1, 4.1], Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28) and CON (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.4 [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-6.1, 1.3], Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22) had no significant effects. The majority (12/14) of participants generally demonstrated positive attitudes toward participation in ES and found it easier than expected while highlighting enablers, barriers, and future recommendations. Stair climbing-based ES could be integrated into the campus setting, appeared feasible, and was similar to MICT regarding future intentions, enjoyment, and satisfaction. Both ES and MICT might induce relevant positive effects on the quality of life, and ES demonstrated greater benefits compared to MICT or CON for reducing perceived stress. Interviews provided positive insights into fostering adherence to ES among university students.
