Study Title: Psychosocial Burden in People with Atopic Dermatitis: Effects of a Substance-Free Basic Skincare in a Randomized Health Care Study.

Study Summary:
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a physical, emotional, and social burden for patients. Most suffer from itching, pain, and dry skin as well as sleep disturbances, experienced stigmatization, anxiety, or depression. Therefore, it is important to consider the psychosocial well-being and also stigmatization in the treatment of people with AD. The aims of this study were to compare clinical and psychosocial parameters between patients with a different severity of AD and to analyse the effect of an omega-6-fatty-acid-skin therapy. Adult patients with clinically confirmed AD were asked about quality of life, stigmatization, and well-being after dermatological diagnosis. A second examination took place after 2-5 weeks. Meanwhile, after randomization, half of the patients used an omega-6-fatty-acid-skin therapy. Seventy-nine patients were included in the study. The use of omega-6-fatty-acid-skin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of xerosis cutis compared to patients using another basic therapy. In addition, the health-related quality of life of all patients improved significantly in both groups (F = 7.56; p = 0.008), and no significant difference was found between the groups over time in the patient-reported outcomes. Basic therapy for AD leads to relevant improvements in clinical status as well as quality of life. Patients using omega-6-fatty-acid-skin therapy experience greater improvement in xerosis cutis compared to free-choice basic therapy.
