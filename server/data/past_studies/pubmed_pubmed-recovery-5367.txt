Study Title: The association of midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) at ICU admission and fluid overload in patients post elective cardiac surgery.

Study Summary:
Postoperative fluid overload (FO) after cardiac surgery is common and affects recovery. Predicting FO could help optimize fluid management. This post-hoc analysis of the HERACLES randomized controlled trial evaluated the predictive value of MR-proADM for FO post-cardiac surgery. MR-proADM levels were measured at four different timepoints in 33 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients were divided into FO (>&#x2009;5% weight gain) and no-FO at ICU discharge. The primary outcome was the predictive power of MR-proADM at ICU admission for FO at discharge. Secondary outcomes included the predictive value of MR-proADM for FO on day 6 post-surgery and changes over time. The association between MR-proADM and FO at ICU discharge or day 6 post-surgery was not significant (crude odds ratio (cOR): 4.3 (95% CI 0.5-40.9, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.201) and cOR 1.1 (95% CI 0.04-28.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.954)). MR-proADM levels over time did not differ significantly between patients with and without FO at ICU discharge (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.803). MR-proADM at ICU admission was not associated with fluid overload at ICU discharge in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. MR-proADM levels over time were not significantly different between groups, although elevated levels were observed in patients with FO.
