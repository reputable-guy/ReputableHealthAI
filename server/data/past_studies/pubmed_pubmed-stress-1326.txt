Study Title: Internet-Based Prevention of Re-Victimization for Youth with Care Experience (EMPOWER-YOUTH): Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Traumatic experiences and maltreatment are highly prevalent among adolescents in foster or institutional care and have severe long-term effects on mental health. Childhood maltreatment increases the risk of revictimization. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the internet-based prevention program EMPOWER YOUTH in reducing victimization experiences among youth with care experience. A total of 163 youth, that is, adolescents in foster or institutional care, adopted adolescents, or young care leavers aged 14 to 21 years (= 17.68 years;= 2.11) were randomized to the six-module guided program or a wait-list control group. The primary endpoint was the decrease in victimization experiences at an 18-week follow-up. Secondary endpoints included risk perception, aggressive tendencies, empathy, prosocial behavior, depressiveness, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and loneliness. About half of the youth exhibited increased psychopathology. No significant interaction between time-point and group was found for victimization measures, though both groups saw a significant reduction over time (= 0.012, &#x3b7;= 0.06;= 0.017, &#x3b7;= 0.06). The intervention group showed a significant increase in perception of thrill-seeking and rebellious risks (= 0.036, &#x3b7;= 0.04;= 0.026, &#x3b7;= 0.05). While EMPOWER YOUTH effectively increased risk perception of thrill-seeking and rebellious behaviors, it should be considered an add-on to more intensive interventions for common mental health disorders in this vulnerable group, rather than a stand-alone online program.
