Study Title: Comparative impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy or diet alone on beta-cell function in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients.

Study Summary:
Although bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes by inducing weight loss and augmenting gut hormone secretion, the immediate effect on beta-cell function itself remains to be elucidated in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, a prospective, randomized trial was performed in 30 patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and a body mass index&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;35&#xa0;kg/m. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in combination with protein-sparing modified fast (PSMF), or to PSMF alone. Eu- and hyperglycemic clamps were performed before and 3&#xa0;weeks after surgery and/or PSMF initiation. The primary outcome was the evolution of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function after surgery, calculated using the composite measures of glucose disposal rate, insulin secretion rate, and disposition index (DI). Results revealed that markers of insulin sensitivity increased similarly in all arms (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43). A higher marker for maximal beta-cell function was observed when comparing SG to PSMF (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). The DI showed a clear positive evolution after RYGB and SG, but not after PSMF alone. Altogether, these findings indicate that bariatric surgery results in an immediate beta-cell function recovery in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.
