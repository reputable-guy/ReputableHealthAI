Study Title: Prognostic value of lymphocytes in patients with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery: A post hoc analysis of a phase III randomized trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the prognostic value of peripheral lymphocyte count (PLC) in the breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiotherapy (RT). This post hoc analysis was performed using data of 628 patients from a phase III, randomized controlled trial comparing hypofractionated RT (HFRT) with conventional fractionated RT (CFRT) after BCS. PLCs were obtained before, during, and after RT until the 1-year follow-up. The optimal cut-off PLCs were determined using the maxstat package in R. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. A total of 275 (46.1&#xa0;%) patients developed lymphopenia during RT, among them, 17 (2.8&#xa0;%) had grade 3 lymphopenia and no one developed grade 4 lymphopenia. With a median follow-up of 110.8&#xa0;months, patients with pre-RT PLCs of&#xa0;<&#xa0;1.77&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;10/L had a significantly lower 10-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) rate (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013) and overall survival (OS) rate (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.026). Patients with a nadir PLC of&#xa0;<&#xa0;1.35&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;10/L had a significantly poorer 10-year OS rate (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.048). Multivariate analysis showed that a pre-RT PLC of&#xa0;<&#xa0;1.77&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;10/L was an independent factor influencing BCSS and OS, while the effect of the nadir PLC did not remain significant. Neither PLC nor lymphopenia recovery at post-RT 1, 3, and 6&#xa0;months and 1&#xa0;year was associated with survival. Radiation-induced lymphopenia in patients with breast cancer after BCS tends to be mild. The lower pre-RT PLC predicted poorer survival.
