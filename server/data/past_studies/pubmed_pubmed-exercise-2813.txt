Study Title: What About Water? Implications for Body Composition Assessment in Military Personnel.

Study Summary:
Sergi, TE, Roberts, BM, and Heileson, JL. What About Water? Implications for Body Composition Assessment in Military Personnel. J Strength Cond Res 38(9): e534-e540, 2024-Body composition standards ensure service members maintain physical fitness, wellness, and support mission readiness. Anthropometric techniques (i.e., height/mass, circumference-based "tape test") have been the primary screening and percent body fat (%BF) assessment method in military personnel for about 4 decades. Recently, the Army and Marine Corps have implemented more advanced body composition assessment methods, such as air displacement plethysmography (ADP), multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA), and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), to serve as supplemental %BF assessment after failing the tape test. Although supplemental assessments are intended to improve on the accuracy and precision of the tape test, preassessment standardization, specifically regarding acute water ingestion (AWI), is lacking. Thus, the purpose of this narrative review was to (a) summarize the available literature regarding the influence of AWI on body composition estimates derived from ADP, MF-BIA, and DXA and (b) provide evidence-based recommendations for researchers and practitioners. Studies indicate that AWI increases %BF estimates with ADP (4 of 6 [4/6] observations) and MF-BIA (6/7), whereas AWI increases muscle mass (6/6) and likely decreases %BF (2/3) when obtained by DXA. In conclusion, ADP, MF-BIA, and DXA are susceptible to confounding from AWI, leading to inaccurate body composition estimates that may negatively affect the careers of military personnel. Based on the findings from this narrative review, military practitioners and researchers should (a) follow manufacturer guidelines for calorie intake [food and fluid] and exercise avoidance, (b) conduct urine-specific gravity testing [if possible], and (c) limit AWI to <250 ml before assessment.
