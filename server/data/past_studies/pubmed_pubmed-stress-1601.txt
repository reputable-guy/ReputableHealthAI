Study Title: Ohio Health Care Professionals' Pandemic-Related Help-Seeking Knowledge, Behaviors, and Concerns.

Study Summary:
Health care professionals (HCPs) historically exhibit high rates of stress, burnout, and low rates of service utilization from Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) and Professional Health Programs (PHPs). New and magnified stressors that accompanied COVID-19 exacerbated HCPs' risk of burnout. During the pandemic, this study examined Ohio HCP's utilization of EAPs and PHPs, knowledge of available services, barriers to accessing services, and likelihood of future service utilization. Conditions needing to change to increase likelihood of future utilization were also explored. A one-time survey was administered in July and August of 2021 to HCPs from 13 licensing boards in Ohio. This study used a subset of data to examine the extent of convergence between quantitative results-analyzed using frequency calculations-and results from thematic analysis of corresponding open-ended survey items. Qualitative results supported and elaborated the quantitative findings. Fewer than 25% of respondents (= 12,807) utilized EAPs or PHPs to address mental health concerns. Obstacles impeding service utilization included issues around awareness, time commitment, and confidentiality-a concern encompassing issues of stigma and fear of employment repercussions. Noting multiple obstacles to accessing EAPs and PHPs, HCPs in Ohio reported low rates of support service utilization and low likeliness to use services in the future despite their experiences of extreme stress and burnout. Addressing the time commitment and confidentiality concerns could increase the likelihood of accessing services. Employers of HCPs should explore additional support mechanisms such as comprehensive wellness programs and innovative, brief intervention strategies to combat burnout, especially during viral outbreaks and other high-stress events.
