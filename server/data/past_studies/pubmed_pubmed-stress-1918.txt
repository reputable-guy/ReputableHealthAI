Study Title: Change in Resting-State Functional Connectivity Following Working Memory Training in Individuals With Repetitive Negative Thinking.

Study Summary:
Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) symptoms, which are characterized by pervasive, uncontrollable negative thoughts, are common in individuals with mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. Inability to regulate the contents of working memory is a hypothesized etiological factor in RNT, which suggests that training to improve working memory may be beneficial. This study examined the effects of working memory training on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in individuals with elevated RNT and whether such changes would be associated with clinical improvement. We conducted a secondary analysis of pre-post resting-state data collected as part of a randomized controlled trial (NCT04912089) of working memory training interventions (n&#xa0;= 42) compared with a waitlist control group (n&#xa0;= 23). We hypothesized that individuals who completed training would show increased rsFC between the 2 key intrinsic connectivity networks-the default mode network (posterior cingulate cortex) and the frontoparietal network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). We explored whether the magnitude of rsFC change was associated with change in RNT symptom severity. rsFC increased between the posterior cingulate cortex and regions including the frontal and parietal cortex in the training group compared with the waitlist group. Increased connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal cortex was associated with RNT symptom reduction. These data provide evidence that working memory training can modulate neural circuitry at rest in individuals with RNT. Results are consistent with accounts of working memory training effects on large-scale neurocircuitry changes and suggest that these changes may contribute to clinical promise of this type of intervention on transdiagnostic RNT symptoms.
