Study Title: The positive effect of spermidine in older adults suffering from dementia : First results of a&#xa0;3-month trial.

Study Summary:
The worldwide prevalence of dementia is estimated at 35.6&#xa0;million and will rise to 115&#xa0;million by 2050. There is therefore an urgent need for well-founded dementia diagnostics and well-researched therapeutic options. Previous studies have highlighted that spermidine has the ability to trigger the important process of dissolving amyloid-beta plaques by autophagy. They also confirmed that nutritional intervention with the natural polyamine spermidine can prevent memory loss in aging model organisms. This multicentric double-blind preliminary study focused on the effect of oral spermidine supplementation on older adults' cognitive performance. Memory tests were carried out on 85&#xa0;subjects aged between&#xa0;60 and 96&#xa0;years in 6 nursing homes in Styria. Blood samples were taken for the determination of spermidine concentration and measurement of metabolic parameters. The results demonstrated a&#xa0;clear correlation between the intake of spermidine and the improvement in cognitive performance in subjects with mild and moderate dementia in the group treated with the higher spermidine dosage. The most substantial improvement in test performance was found in the group of subjects with mild dementia with an increase of 2.23&#xa0;points (p&#x202f;=&#x2009;0.026) in the mini mental state examination (MMSE) and 1.99 (p&#x202f;=&#x2009;0.47) in phonematic fluidity. By comparison, the group which had a&#xa0;lower spermidine intake showed consistent or declining cognitive performance.
