Study Title: [Long-term effect analysis of a cognitive stimulation program in mild cognitive impairment elderly in Primary Care: A randomized controlled trial].

Study Summary:
To provide evidence about the efficacy of a community health intervention through a cognitive stimulation program at long term in older people with mild cognitive impairment. Randomized controlled trial (CONSORT group norms). San Jos&#xe9; Norte-Centro Primary Care Center and La Caridad Foundation (Zaragoza, Spain). Twenty-nine people over 65 years old with a 24-27 MEC score that completed 48 months follow up. They were randomized between the intervention group (15) and the control group (14). The intervention was applied in 10 sessions of 45min for 10 weeks using the red notebook tool for mental activation that works memory, orientation, language, praxis, gnosis, calculation, perception, logical reasoning, attention and executive functions. The main outcome variables were MEC-35, Set-test, Barthel index, Lawton-Brody scale, Goldberg anxiety scale and Yesavage geriatric depression scale short form. Increases of the main result variable over the baseline level of MEC-35 were analyzed. On average, the intervention group obtained higher scores than control: 3.14 points post intervention, 3.76 points after 6 months and 2.26 points more than control group after 12 months. All the differences were statistically significant. After 48 months the intervention group obtained 2 points more than control group. The intervention did not improve verbal fluency, activity daily living and mood. Our cognitive stimulation program seems to improve cognitive performance, measured with the variable MEC-35 at post intervention, 6, 12 and 48 months. There is no evidence of improvement in verbal fluency, activity daily livings and mood. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03831061.
