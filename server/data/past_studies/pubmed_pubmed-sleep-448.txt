Study Title: A 6-month educational program improves sleep behaviour in community-dwelling frail older adults: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The prevalence of sleep-related issues among older adults is a significant concern, with half of the older population reporting these problems. Consequently, strategies to improve sleep are needed for this population. This study aims to assess the effects of a health educational program on sleep behaviour among pre-frail or frail older adults residing in the community and to explore possible associations with frailty. This randomised controlled trial (NCT05610605) included a total of 197 community-dwelling older adults with frailty/pre-frailty, divided into control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;88) and educational (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;109) groups, were assessed at baseline, after the 6-month educational program (6 months), and 6 months after the intervention (12 months). The intervention comprised four group sessions and six follow-up phone calls, focusing on frailty, physical activity, dietary habits, and cognitive training. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and wrist-worn accelerometry. At 6 months, a significant time-by-group interaction was found for self-reported [&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.449, 95%CI (-0.844, -0.053), p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.026] and accelerometer-measured [&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.505, 95%CI (0.085, 0.926), p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.019] sleep efficiency, showing improved sleep efficiency in the intervention group vs. controls. A significant time-by-group interaction at 6 months was noted for sleep awakenings [&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.402, 95%CI (-0.825, -0.020), p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.047]. The educational program led to a significant decrease in awakenings, while the control group experienced an increase. The change in the number of awakenings (Rs&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.183, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.020) at 6 months was significantly associated with changes in frailty. Moreover, a significant time-by-group interaction was reported at the 12-month assessment [&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.449, 95%CI (-0.844, -0.053), p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.026] for self-reported sleep quality, indicating better results in the intervention group compared to controls. The educational program improved sleep quality and sleep efficiency while reducing the number of awakenings per night among community-dwelling frail older adults, offering a practical approach to addressing sleep-related challenges in this demographic.
