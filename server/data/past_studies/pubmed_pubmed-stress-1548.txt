Study Title: The Scholarship of Wellness and Mindfulness to Support First-Year Nursing Students' Response to Stress.

Study Summary:
An educational innovation centered on mindfulness was developed to support the well-being of first-year nursing students at a large public university. Students participated in a week-long experiential learning program before their first semester. They then enrolled in a one-credit course that fostered well-being through research and evidence-based mindfulness practices. The course was highly ranked because of the quality of learning, environment, and theories presented, indicating that supportive wellness initiatives are acceptable and feasibility for future implementation.
