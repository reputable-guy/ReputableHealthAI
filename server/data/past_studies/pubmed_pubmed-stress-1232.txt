Study Title: Peer support groups and care burden in hemodialysis caregivers: a RCT in an Iranian healthcare setting.

Study Summary:
Chronic renal failure poses a significant global health challenge, exerting a substantial burden on both patients and their caregivers. Hemodialysis, a common treatment for end-stage renal disease, imposes extensive physical, emotional, and financial pressures on caregivers, often leading to a high care burden. This study uniquely examines the impact of peer support groups on reducing the care burden among caregivers of patients receiving hemodialysis in an Iranian healthcare setting, an aspect that has not been extensively explored before. A parallel-controlled clinical trial was conducted involving 60 caregivers, divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group participated in an 8-session peer support program tailored to their identified needs, including coping with stress, social isolation, and financial challenges. The Zarit Care Burden Interview Scale was used to measure care burden before and after the intervention. The study revealed statistically significant reductions in care burden, particularly in physical, social, and emotional dimensions, among caregivers in the intervention group compared to the control group. The total care burden score showed a marked decrease, indicating the effectiveness of the peer support intervention. While economic challenges remained a concern, the intervention had a limited impact in this domain. This study demonstrates that peer support groups significantly alleviate the care burden experienced by caregivers of patients receiving hemodialysis, improving their well-being across several dimensions. The findings highlight the importance of integrating peer support strategies into healthcare programs for chronic disease management and underscore the need for supplementary economic support measures to comprehensively address caregivers' needs. Future research should explore the scalability and long-term sustainability of such interventions and address the unique economic challenges faced by these caregivers. This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) under the registration number IRCT20220724055540N1 on 11/08/2022.
