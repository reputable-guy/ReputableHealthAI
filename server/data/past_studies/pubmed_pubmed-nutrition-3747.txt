Study Title: Longitudinal changes in choline concentration and associated factors in human breast milk.

Study Summary:
Human breast milk is the primary source of choline and choline-containing compounds for infants at early stages of life. Choline data across lactation in Chinese human milk were limited. This study aimed to quantify the five choline compounds in Chinese human breast milk and explore associated factors. A total of 540 lactating mothers from the MUAI (Maternal Nutrition and Infant Investigation) study were included. The content of water-soluble choline (free choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine) and lipid-soluble choline (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin) in 892 human milk samples collected from 0 to 400 days postpartum were examined, and associated factors were explored. Choline concentrations in human milk varied from postpartum day 0-400 (92.06&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;65.22 to 171.01&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;47.84&#xa0;mg/L). Water-soluble choline was the major component (88.6%-93.8%) in human milk and ranged from 793.03 (659.22) to 1544.43 (443.32) &#x3bc;mol/L. Its trajectory followed that of total choline, increasing from colostrum to transitional milk and then declining in mature milk. In contrast, lipid-soluble choline accounted for 6.2%-11.4% over lactation and had an opposite trajectory. Choline composition varied by delivery mode and parity history. The concentrations of individual choline and choline-containing compounds during lactation in Chinese human breast milk were described for the first time. Our results address gaps in extant Chinese human milk choline data and support tailored dietary reference intakes for Chinese lactating women and infants. Our data describes the level and profile of choline from 0 to 400 days postpartum in Chinese human breast milk. This is the most updated data on choline and also the first report of water-soluble choline as the predominant type in Chinese human milk. Our results compensate for the deficiencies in data on choline in Chinese human milk. Clinical Trial Registry number: ChiCTR1800015387.
