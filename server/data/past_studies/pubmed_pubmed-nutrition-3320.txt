Study Title: The effect of abdominal massage and in-bed ROM exercise on gastrointestinal complications and comfort in intensive care unit patients receiving enteral nutrition: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Abdominal massage facilitates gastric and colonic motility, reduces intra-abdominal distension and increases circulation. In-bed range of motion (ROM) exercise has effects on muscle strength, cardiac parameters and excretion. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of abdominal massage and in-bed ROM exercise on gastrointestinal complications and patient comfort in intensive care patients receiving enteral nutrition. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the internal intensive care units of two tertiary public hospitals. The sample consisted of 130 patients randomly assigned to three groups (abdominal massage&#x2009;=&#x2009;44, in-bed ROM exercise&#x2009;=&#x2009;43, control&#x2009;=&#x2009;43). The individuals received abdominal massage and in-bed ROM exercises every morning before enteral feeding for 3&#x2009;days. We assessed gastrointestinal complications and comfort levels of the patients 24&#x2009;h after each intervention. While the differences in abdominal distention, defecation status, constipation, and gastric residual volume complications were significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05), there was no significant difference in diarrhea and vomiting (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05). Comfort level showed a statistically significant change in the experimental groups in the in-group comparison (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). Abdominal massage and in-bed ROM exercise reduce abdominal distention, constipation and gastric residual volume. Abdominal massage affects the frequency of defecation; and, both interventions increase the comfort while reducing the pain level over time.
