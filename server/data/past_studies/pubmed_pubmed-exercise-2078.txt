Study Title: Acute aerobic exercise ameliorates craving and attentional function in individuals with methamphetamine use disorders.

Study Summary:
Chronic methamphetamine use is frequently associated with impairments in the attentional network (alerting, orienting, conflict networks) and related brain regions, which significantly trigger METH-related cravings. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity acute aerobic exercise on cravings and attentional networks in individuals with methamphetamine use disorders (MUD). Using a cross-over design, this study recruited 32 male MUDs to randomly complete a 30min moderate-intensity aerobics exercise condition (65%-75% HRmax) and an assigned material reading control condition, with a 7-day washout interval. All participants completed Visual Analog Scales before, during, and after exercise, until the HR dropped to 110% of the resting heart rate, in preparation for the Attention Network Test (ANT). The aerobic exercise significantly reduces the participants' cravings. There were no differences observed in the efficiency of alerting and orienting networks between the aerobic exercise and control conditions, however, the efficiency of conflict network was enhanced after exercise. Furthermore, the results showed a significant negative correlation between the enhancements in conflict network efficiency and the reductions in post-exercise craving scores for both conditions. Moderate-intensity acute aerobic exercise significantly improves the attentional network, especially enhancing the conflict network in individuals with MUD. Additionally, the improvement of the conflict network is closely related to the reduction in cravings in individuals with MUD, suggesting that aerobic exercise may reduce cravings through improvements in cognitive function.
