Study Title: Efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec versus once-daily basal insulin in Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes: A subgroup analysis of the ONWARDS 1, 2 and 4 trials.

Study Summary:
To explore the efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec (icodec) in Japanese adults (&#x2265;20&#x2009;years old) with type 2 diabetes from the global ONWARDS 1, 2 and 4 trials. Insulin-naive (ONWARDS 1) and insulin-experienced (ONWARDS 2 and 4) individuals were randomized to icodec or a once-daily insulin comparator: insulin glargine U100 [ONWARDS 1 (basal insulin only) and 4 (basal-bolus regimen)] or insulin degludec [ONWARDS 2 (basal insulin only)]. The primary outcome was change in glycated haemoglobin from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) (ONWARDS 1: Week 52; ONWARDS 2 and 4: Week 26). Here, we present the Japanese subgroup results. Similar reductions in glycated haemoglobin from baseline to EOT were observed in each trial for icodec and comparators. The proportion of time in range (blood glucose 3.9-10.0&#x2009;mmol/L) at EOT was also comparable across treatment groups (time in range: 58%-68%), as was time spent with blood glucose below 3.0&#x2009;mmol/L (<1.0%). Combined clinically significant (blood glucose <3.0&#x2009;mmol/L) or severe (requiring external assistance for recovery) hypoglycaemia rates were low, with no severe events (ONWARDS 1 and 2) or a single severe event (ONWARDS 4; icodec group) reported. These results generally aligned with findings from the respective global populations. No new safety issues were identified. Icodec improved glycaemic control to a similar degree as once-daily basal insulin comparators while maintaining low levels of clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemia. The findings support icodec use in Japanese individuals with different levels of type 2 diabetes progression.
