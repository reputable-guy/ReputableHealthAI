Study Title: The Impact of Telemonitoring and Telehealth Coaching on General Nutrition Knowledge in Overweight and Obese Individuals: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: General nutrition knowledge is a fundamental pillar of well-being and healthy lifestyles. This study aimed to measure the general nutrition knowledge questionnaire (GNKQ) scores of overweight and obese participants who joined a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the association between changes in GNKQ scores and changes in anthropometric measures. (2) Methods: A total of 30 and 25 participants had completed the trial at the 3- and 6-month visits, respectively. All participants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and received a hypocaloric-tailored diet and three online nutrition education sessions over 6 months. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: an intervention group supported with weekly telemonitoring and monthly telehealth coaching vs. a control group. The Arabic-validated GNKQ was used, covering four sections: dietary recommendations; food groups and nutrient sources; healthy food choices; and associations between the diet-disease relationship and weight. (3) Results: The findings show that both the intervention and control groups showed improvements in GNKQ scores over time, with the intervention group demonstrating significant increases in overall nutrition knowledge and specific areas, such as the diet-disease relationship and weight management, at 3 months. In addition, changes in GNKQ scores had a significant negative association with BMI and visceral fat percentage. The findings underline the benefits of supporting dietary weight loss interventions with telemonitoring and telehealth coaching, suggesting that an increase in nutrition knowledge may relate to lower body fat metrics. Nevertheless, the small sample size and high attrition rate of participants were the main limitations of this study, such that large populations are required to confirm the reliability of the obtained findings.
