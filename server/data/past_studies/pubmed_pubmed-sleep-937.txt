Study Title: Effects of the PREMEN-CALM&#xae; in the Management of the Premenstrual Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Premenstrual syndrome is a common disorder in women of reproductive age characterized by a variety of cyclical symptoms with a great impact on their lifestyle. Available pharmacological options include both antidepressants and oral contraceptives, both of which have side effects, are expensive and not always effective. Vitamins, minerals and plant extracts have been proven to alleviate the symptomatology of the premenstrual syndrome. For this reason, the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a commercial phytotherapeutic dietary supplement (PREMEN-CALM: &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid,.,, vitamin B6 and melatonin) as an alternative treatment for this condition. A randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled pilot study was performed. Participants (&#x2009;=&#x2009;42) were assessed before and after 3&#x2009;months of taking the supplement (&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) or the placebo (&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). Outcome measures include antioxidant and inflammatory biomarkers, body composition, subjective sleep quality, mood state profile, quality of life, and certain characteristics of the menstrual cycle. The within-group analysis revealed a significant improvement in the total antioxidant status (1.49&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.34 vs reference value 1,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), mood state profile (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), and affective symptoms (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) in the women receiving the commercial phytotherapeutic dietary supplement PREMEN-CALM. On the contrary, the between-group analysis showed no statistical differences, suggesting a plausible placebo effect. The phytotherapeutic supplement PREMEN-CALMmight be effective in treating or alleviating the symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome without adverse events. Integrative medicine approaches in the clinical practice may help improve the health of women suffering from this and other gynecological conditions.
