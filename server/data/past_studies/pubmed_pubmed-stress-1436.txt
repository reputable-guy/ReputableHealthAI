Study Title: Trauma-Informed Development and Education: Turning the TIDE on Transition to Practice.

Study Summary:
Transition to practice (TTP), the first year of a nurse's career postlicensure, is widely recognized as a stressful time. Previous trauma exposure and additional workplace trauma exacerbate the stress of this transitional period. Trauma-informed environments are associated with clinician wellness and engagement. Because workforce training for leaders is a necessary precursor to developing supportive environments, we studied changes in trauma knowledge, awareness, and attitudes among TTP leaders. Our mixed methods study included administering the Attitudes Related to Trauma-Informed Care Scale (ARTIC) pre- and post-training, with additional open-ended questions about the impact of training. Paired data from participants showed overall mean improvement that was statistically significant, with a large effect size. Statistically significant knowledge gains related to trauma recognition and safety, how to respond to trauma, and how to promote healthy behaviors. Our study underscores the importance of trauma education, which not only increased awareness but also prompted nurse leaders to reflect on enhanced support for early nursing professionals..
