Study Title: No Combined Effect of Caffeinated Chewing Gum and Priming Exercise on Oxygen Uptake and Muscle Near-Infrared Spectroscopy-Derived Kinetics: A Double-Blind Randomized Crossover Placebo-Controlled Trial in Cyclists.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effects of caffeine ingestion by chewing gum (GUMCAF) combined with priming exercise on pulmonary oxygen uptake (V&#x2d9;O2) and near-infrared spectroscopy-derived muscle oxygen extraction (HHb + Mb) kinetics during cycling performed in a severe-intensity domain. Fifteen trained cyclists completed four visits: two under a placebo gum (GUMPLA) and two under GUMCAF ingestion. Each visit consisted of two square-wave cycling bouts at &#x394;70 intensity (70% of difference between the V&#x2d9;O2 at first ventilatory threshold and V&#x2d9;O2max) with duration of 6&#xa0;min each and 5&#xa0;min of passive rest between the bouts. The GUMPLA or GUMCAF (400&#xa0;mg) was chewed for 5&#xa0;min, 12&#xa0;min before the first &#x394;70 bout in a randomized double-blind procedure. The fundamental phase and slow component of HHb + Mb and V&#x2d9;O2 kinetics were evaluated. For HHb + Mb kinetics, regardless of ingested gum, priming exercise effects occurred on the time constant (GUMCAF 16.0 &#xb1; 4.0 vs. 13.9 &#xb1; 2.9&#xa0;s; GUMPLA 15.7 &#xb1; 6.1 vs. 13.2 &#xb1; 2.5&#xa0;s), amplitude, slow component, time delay, and mean response time parameters (p &#x2264; .032). For V&#x2d9;O2 kinetics, there were significant effects of bouts on the amplitude, slow component, end V&#x2d9;O2, and the gain kinetics parameters (p < .017). Baseline V&#x2d9;O2 was higher during GUMCAF than GUMPLA (p = .020). No significant effects occurred for the interaction between gum and bout in any parameter of V&#x2d9;O2 or HHb + Mb kinetics. Therefore, unlike the priming exercise in severe-intensity exercise, GUMCAF is not an effective strategy for improving V&#x2d9;O2 or HHb + Mb kinetics acceleration.
