Study Title: Exercise intensity of virtual reality exergaming modulates the responses to executive function and affective response in sedentary young adults: A randomized, controlled crossover feasibility study.

Study Summary:
Virtual reality (VR) exergaming is a novel strategy to encourage physical activity and boost emotional well-being. However, its effects on executive function (EF) are not fully understood. This study assessed the immediate and retention effects of immersive VR exergaming, at varying exercise intensities, on EF and affect among sedentary college students. Thirty participants (mean age = 22.2 &#xb1; 2.5 years; 18 females) underwent 15-minute sessions of moderate-intensity (MI), high-intensity (HI), and active-control intensity (AC) VR exergaming in a counterbalanced order. EF was evaluated using the Flanker, Task-switching, and N-back tasks before, immediately after, and 30 min post-intervention. Emotional valence and arousal were measured by the Feeling Scale and Felt Arousal Scale, respectively. The inverse efficiency score (IES) results indicated that inhibitory control was higher following both MI and HI exergaming compared to AC (p < 0.05), with improvements sustained for 30 minutes HI VR exergaming showed the greatest improvement (p = 0.048). Both HI and MI also exhibited higher working memory capacity than AC (p < 0.05), with HI performing better (p = 0.039). No significant differences in task-switching performance were observed among the groups (p > 0.05). Emotional valence and arousal were significantly elevated immediately after and sustained for 30 minutes following MI and HI exergaming (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates the cognitive and affective benefits of MI and HI VR exergaming in young adults, with HI VR exergaming showing longer-lasting improvements. These findings suggest that immersive VR exergaming can enhance both physical and cognitive health, potentially improving academic performance and daily functionality in collegiate populations.
