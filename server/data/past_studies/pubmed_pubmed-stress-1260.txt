Study Title: OXY-SCORE and Volatile Anesthetics: A New Perspective of Oxidative Stress in EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair-A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
An aortic aneurysm (AA) is a life-threatening condition. Oxidative stress may be a common pathway linking multiple mechanisms of an AA, including vascular inflammation and metalloproteinase activity. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the preferred surgical approach for AA treatment. During surgery, inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury occur, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in their modulation. Increased perioperative oxidative stress is associated with higher postoperative complications. The use of volatile anesthetics during surgery has been shown to reduce oxidative stress. Individual biomarkers only partially reflect the oxidative status of the patients. A global indicator of oxidative stress (OXY-SCORE) has been validated in various pathologies. This study aimed to compare the effects of the main volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane, on oxidative status during EVAR. Eighty consecutive patients undergoing EVAR were randomized into two groups: sevoflurane and desflurane. Plasma biomarkers of oxidative damage (protein carbonylation and malondialdehyde) and antioxidant defense (total thiols, glutathione, nitrates, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity) were measured before surgery and 24 h after EVAR. The analysis of individual biomarkers showed no significant differences between the groups. However, the OXY-SCORE was positive in the desflurane group (indicating a shift towards antioxidants) and negative in the sevoflurane group (favoring oxidants) (< 0.044). Compared to sevoflurane, desflurane had a positive effect on oxidative stress during EVAR. The OXY-SCORE could provide a more comprehensive perspective on oxidative stress in this patient population.
