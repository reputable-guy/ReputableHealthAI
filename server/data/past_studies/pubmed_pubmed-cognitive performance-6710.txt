Study Title: Relationships among neurotransmitters, cytokines and cognitive performance for individuals with hepatitis C achieving sustained virologic response: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
An important extrahepatic consequence of Hepatitis C is its adverse impact on the central nervous system and cognitive performance. We aimed to determine whether there is a significant relationship between selected neurotransmitters and cytokines and cognitive performance in patients with Chronic Hepatitis C before and after achieving sustained virologic response (SVR). Pre-SVR, elevated kynurenine was associated with increased immediate and delayed visual memory, whereas post-SVR the positive associations are between kynurenine and immediate and delayed verbal memory. TGF-B was consistently negatively associated with both immediate and delayed visual memory pre- and post-SVR. These concomitant changes may have important clinical relevance.
