Study Title: Positive effects of fampridine on cognition, fatigue and depression in patients with multiple sclerosis over 2&#xa0;years.

Study Summary:
To assess the effects of PR-fampridine on cognitive functioning, fatigue and depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Thirty-two PwMS were included in this trial. Cognitive performance was assessed in an open-label and randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study design using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery as well as questionnaires examining depression and fatigue. We found significant improvements in cognitive measures assessing alertness (tonic alertness, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0244 and phasic alertness, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0428), psychomotor speed (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0140) as well as verbal fluency (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0002) during open-label treatment with PR-fampridine. These effects of performance were paralleled by patients' perception of reduced fatigue (physical, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0131; cognitive, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0225; total, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0126). Fampridine-induced improvements in phasic alertness (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0010) and measures of fatigue (physical, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0014; cognitive, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0003; total, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0005) were confirmed during randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled assessment in the second year. In addition, we found positive effects of PR-fampridine on depressive symptoms (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0049). We demonstrated persisting beneficial effects of PR-fampridine on fatigue in PwMS over a period of more than 2&#xa0;years. Drug responsiveness regarding cognitive performance and fatigue was not limited to walking responders. Our data demonstrate significant positive effects of treatment with PR-fampridine over 2&#xa0;years on different cognitive domains as well as fatigue and depression in a cohort of PwMS. These findings imply that PR-fampridine should be considered as symptomatic treatment improving aspects of cognition, fatigue and depression in PwMS.
