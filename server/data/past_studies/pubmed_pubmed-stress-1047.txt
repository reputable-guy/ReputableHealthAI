Study Title: Comparison of the escape room and storytelling methods in learning the stress response: A randomized controlled pilot study.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Escape Room and Storytelling methods on nursing students' learning about the topic of stress response. It is recommended that new generations be trained using innovative teaching methods that differ from traditional teaching methods. The Escape Room and Storytelling methods are among the techniques that have been used and recommended for this purpose. The study was conducted with a randomized, controlled design. Thirty-five (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;35) second-year undergraduate nursing students were randomly divided into two groups, one group was trained on stress response using the Escape Room method, while the other group was trained using the Storytelling method. Focus-group interviews were conducted with the students after the interventions. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the median post-intervention knowledge assessment score. It was determined that the students in the Escape Room group scored significantly higher than those in the Storytelling group (p&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.05) CONCLUSIONS: The use of these methods, which ensure the active participation of students and increase their motivation, effectively contributes to meeting the educational needs of students and increases their level of satisfaction.
