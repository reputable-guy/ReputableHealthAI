Study Title: Decision Outcomes in Sport: Influence of Type and Level of Stress.

Study Summary:
In two experiments, the authors investigated the influence of stress type (i.e.,&#xa0;low/no stress, mental, and physical), level (i.e.,&#xa0;low, moderate, and high), and Type &#xd7; Level interaction on intuitive decision frequency, decision quality, and decision speed. Participants were exposed to mental (i.e.,&#xa0;color word task, mental arithmetic) and/or physical stress (i.e.,&#xa0;running) and then required to make decisions regarding videotaped offensive situations in basketball. Intuitive decision frequency, decision quality, and decision speed were measured for each trial. Study 1 used a between-subjects design whereby 20 participants were randomly assigned to each of the five stress conditions. Results revealed that moderate stress was associated with faster decisions. Study 2 replicated the design and aim of Study 1 using a within-subject methodology (n = 42). Results suggested that moderate stress levels produced better, faster decisions. In conclusion, moderate levels of stress were associated with the most desirable decision outcomes.
