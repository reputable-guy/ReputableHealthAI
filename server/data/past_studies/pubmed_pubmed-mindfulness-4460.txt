Study Title: Effects of hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, and education for chronic pain on substance use in veterans: A supplementary analysis of a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To examine the impact of three behavioral interventions for chronic pain on substance use. Participants were 328 Veterans with chronic pain receiving care at one of two Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the northwest United States. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three 8-week manualized in-person group treatments: (a) hypnosis (HYP), (b) mindfulness meditation (MM), or (c) active education control (ED). Substance use frequency was assessed using 10 individual items from the WHO-ASSIST, administered at baseline prior to randomization and at 3- and 6-month posttreatment. Baseline substance use (i.e., any use) in the past 3 months was reported by 22% (tobacco), 27% (cannabis), and 61% (alcohol) of participants. Use of all other substances assessed was reported by < 7% of participants. Results showed that MM, as compared to ED, significantly reduced risk of daily cannabis use by 85% and 81% at the 3- and 6-month posttreatment follow-ups, respectively, after adjusting for baseline use. HYP, as compared to ED, significantly reduced risk of daily cannabis use by 82% at the 6-month posttreatment follow-up after adjusting for baseline use. There was no intervention effect on tobacco or alcohol use at either posttreatment follow-up. HYP and MM for chronic pain may facilitate reductions in cannabis use, even when reducing such use is not a focus of treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).
