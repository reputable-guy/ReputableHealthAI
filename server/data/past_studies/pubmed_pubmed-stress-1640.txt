Study Title: Burnout and career satisfaction in young neuro-oncology investigators: Results of the Society for Neuro-Oncology Young Investigator Survey.

Study Summary:
Burnout is a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of accomplishment, which commonly arises from chronic workplace stress in the medical field. Given the higher risk of burnout in younger age groups reported in some studies, the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Young Investigator (YI) and Wellness Committees combined efforts to examine burnout in the SNO YI membership to better understand and address their needs. We distributed an anonymous online survey to SNO members in 2019. Only those meeting the definition of a YI were asked to complete the survey. The survey consisted of questions about personal and professional characteristics as well as the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) questionnaire. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analyses, and incorporation of previously defined burnout profiles. Data were analyzed for 173 participants who self-identified as YI. Measures of burnout showed that YI members scored higher on emotional exhaustion and depersonalization compared to normative population but similar to those in a prior SNO general membership survey. With respect to burnout profiles, 30% of YI respondents classified as overextended and 15% as burnout. Organizational challenges were the most common contributors to stress. Similar to results from a previous survey completed by general SNO membership, the prevalence of burnout among neuro-oncology clinical and research YI is high, and is mainly characterized by overextension, warranting interventions at institutional and organizational levels.
