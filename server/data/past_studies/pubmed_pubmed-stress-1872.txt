Study Title: Stress-related eating in pregnancy? An RCT examining links between prenatal stress and food choices.

Study Summary:
Diet quality during pregnancy is important for maternal health and offspring development. However, national dietary recommendations are not always met. A potential barrier for healthy food choices might be the experience of stress. Previous literature in non-pregnant populations suggests a negative effect of acute stress on diet quality. This preregistered study is the first to test whether an acute stressor leads to unhealthy food choices in pregnancy and examine the moderating role of stress, depressive and anxiety complaints in daily life. Pregnant women (N = 110, 3rd trimester) completed online self-reported surveys measuring stress, depressive and anxiety complaints in daily life. Hereafter, participants were invited for a laboratory visit, in which they were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test or a control task. After this manipulation, self-reported and actual food choices and food intake were assessed. At the end of the visit, a hair sample was collected. Throughout the visit, visual analogue scales on negative affect were completed and saliva samples were collected. The stress group experienced significantly more psychological stress than the control group during the experimental manipulation. Main regression analyses showed that the acute laboratory stressor did not cause unhealthy food choices in the third trimester of pregnancy. In fact, the stress group chose fewer unhealthy foods and consumed fewer kilocalories compared to the control group. Additionally, the findings point at a moderating role of depressive and stress complaints in daily life on food choices within the control group: higher scores were related to more unhealthy food choices and more kilocalories consumed. As this was the first study to test the effect of an acute stressor on food choices in pregnant women, more research is needed to obtain a better understanding of stress-related eating in pregnancy. This knowledge may inform future interventions to support pregnant women in improving their diet quality.
