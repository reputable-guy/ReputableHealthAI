Study Title: Efficacy and safety of eculizumab in Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome: A phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (GBS) is an acute, self-limited, immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy. Current treatments for GBS include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange, which may not sufficiently benefit severely affected patients. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of eculizumab add-on therapy to IVIg (standard-of-care treatment) in patients with severe GBS. This phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT04752566), enrolled Japanese adults (age&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years) with severe GBS (Hughes functional grade [FG] score FG3 or FG4/FG5 within 2&#x2009;weeks of onset of GBS). Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive intravenous infusion of eculizumab or placebo (once weekly for 4&#x2009;weeks) with IVIg treatment with 20&#x2009;weeks of follow-up. Primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first reach FG score &#x2264;1 (able to run). Key secondary endpoints were proportion of participants achieving FG &#x2264;1 at weeks 8 and 24 and FG improvement &#x2265;3 at week 24. Pharmacodynamic analysis of serum free C5 concentration over time was performed. Safety was evaluated. The analysis included 57 participants (eculizumab, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37; placebo, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). Primary endpoint was not achieved (hazard ratio, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.45-1.97; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.89). Key secondary endpoints did not reach statistical significance. Serum C5 concentration was reduced by 99.99% at 1&#x2009;h postdose and sustained to week 5 but returned to baseline at the end of follow-up period. No new safety signals for eculizumab were identified. Although well tolerated, eculizumab treatment did not show significant effects on motor function recovery compared to placebo in patients with GBS.
