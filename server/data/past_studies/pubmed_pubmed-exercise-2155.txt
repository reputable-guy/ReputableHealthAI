Study Title: Resistance training improves functional capacities in women with multiple sclerosis: a randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of resistance exercise training (RT) on oxidative status, muscle strength, functional capacity, quality of life (QoL), and fatigue in women with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this randomized control trial (ethical code: SSRI.REC-1402-101; IRCT registration code: IRCT20120912010824N3, 07.09.2023), Iran) twenty-five women with relapsing- remitting MS (aged 18-45 years and expanded disability status scale (EDSS)&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;4) were randomly divided in two groups MS without resistance exercise (MS&#x2009;+&#x2009;non-RT; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) and with RT (12 weeks/3 times per week/ 60-80% of 1RM) (MS&#x2009;+&#x2009;RT; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12). "Informed" consent was obtained from all participants. Then, fifteen healthy aged-matched women participated as a control group (HCON; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). Blood serum levels of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and antioxidant capacity [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity] were obtained pre and post intervention. In addition, muscle strength by 5-RM test, functional capacity (for lower limb T25FWT, 2MWT, and 5STS tests and for Upper limb Manual dexterity of both hands with the (9-HPT) test and MSWS-12 questionnaire were also assessed over the same period. Also, Quality of life and fatigue were assessed pre- and post- intervention with by 31-MusiQoL questionnaire and FSMC questionnaire. RT led to improvements in muscle strength for leg extension, lying leg curl, bench press movements (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, respectively). Moreover, compared with the MS&#x2009;+&#x2009;non-RT group, RT demonstrated increased functional capacity (Timed 25 ft Walk Test, Two-Minute Walk Test, 5-Time Sit-To-Stand Test, Twelve Item MS Walking Scale (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, respectively). Dexterity of the left hand but not the right hand also improved (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.057, respectively). Improvements were also found for fatigue and QoL (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). However, the mean changes of MDA, SOD and GPx noted in RT group were not statistically significant (P&#x2c3;0.05, P&#x2c3;0.05, P&#x2c3;0.05, respectively). RT has positive effects on muscle strength, functional capacity, and quality of life while reducing fatigue in this population. However, markers of oxidative stress were not affected. When we consider the clear role in MS pathogenesis and progression, antioxidant increases in relation to a reduction in pro-oxidant capacity would have provided a positive and important clinical development for people with MS.
