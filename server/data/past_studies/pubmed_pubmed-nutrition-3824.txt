Study Title: Effect of nutritional promotion intervention on dietary adherence among type II diabetes patients in North Shoa Zone Amhara Region: quasi-experimental study.

Study Summary:
Diabetes is a major global public health problem that requires self-management behavior. However, this is difficult to implement in practice and requires new approaches. The purpose of this study was to evaluate nutritional promotion interventions for dietary adherence and lessons learned to improve self-management. A quasi-experimental study was conducted from January 2020 to February 2021 in North Shoa Zone public hospital. The study enrolled 216 type II diabetic patients from four public hospitals. Study participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups at an individual level. Data were measured twice (baseline and end line survey after six months using interviewer-administered questionnaires). Data were entered into Epi Data V.3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Data were presented as means of standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. Intervention and control groups were compared before and after intervention using independent t tests. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests. A total of 216 type II diabetics participated in this study. Nutritional promotion intervention programs increased adherence to the mean number of days adhering to a healthy diet (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001). Specifically, the nutrition promotion program improved daily intake of fruits and vegetables, low glycemic index foods, high fiber foods, healthy fish oils, low sugar foods, and healthy eating plans (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.050). Mean fasting blood glucose levels were significantly decreased after the educational intervention (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05). This study demonstrates that a nutrition-promoting intervention can significantly change patients' adherence to healthy eating behaviors and effectively improve their glycemic control. Health care providers should integrate programs that promote nutrition education into existing health systems service. Primary care platforms such as health posts and health centers can play a key role in integrating health promotion programs to improve self-management behaviors.
