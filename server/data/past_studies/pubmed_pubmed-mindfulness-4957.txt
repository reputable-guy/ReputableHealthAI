Study Title: Effects of mobile mindfulness on emergency department work stress: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
High-occupational stress among ED staff has a detrimental impact on both staff wellness and patient care. The objective of the study is to determine whether 4&#x2009;weeks of smartphone app-guided mindfulness practice reduces stress levels of ED staff. This two-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted in two Australian EDs in 2019-2020. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either an App group or a Wait to Treat group to practice daily 10&#xa0;min app-guided mindfulness for 4&#x2009;weeks. Online surveys were collected for both groups at three time periods: before (T1), immediately after (T2) and 3&#xa0;months after cessation (T3). Then the Wait to Treat group received the same intervention, followed by surveys immediately after the intervention (T4) and 3&#xa0;months later (T5). Primary outcome was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment), Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis were performed. Repeated measurement data were analysed by the linear mixed model. Of 148 enrolled participants 98 completed all the surveys, but only half (48%) reported continuous use of the app. Based on the results of the intention-to-treat analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement of perceived stress levels (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;15.70, P <&#x2009;0.001), all three components of burnout (emotional exhaustion [F =&#xa0;14.22, P <&#x2009;0.001], depersonalisation [F&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.62, P =&#x2009;0.030], personal accomplishment [F&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.51, P&#xa0;<&#x2009;0.001]), mindfulness (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.83, P&#xa0;<&#x2009;0.001) and wellbeing levels (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;10.71, P&#xa0;<&#x2009;0.001) from pre-intervention to 3&#xa0;months later with small effect sizes. Results of the present study demonstrate that brief mindfulness training via innovative digital technology had a small positive effect in improving emergency staff stress, burnout, mindfulness and wellbeing.
