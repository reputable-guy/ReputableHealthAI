Study Title: Do effects of methylphenidate on cognitive performance last beyond treatment? A randomized placebo-controlled trial in boys and men with ADHD.

Study Summary:
Methylphenidate (MPH) is the first-choice pharmacological treatment for treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) across the lifespan. However, it is unclear whether MPH affects cognitive development, while recent (pre-) clinical studies suggest effects on the developing brain. The present randomized, placebo-controlled trial aims to determine whether MPH has short-term, age-dependent effects on cognitive performance in ADHD after a 1-week washout. Effects of 16 weeks MPH treatment were assessed after a one-week washout on cognitive functioning. Boys (age=10-12) and men (age=23-40) with ADHD were assigned to MPH treatment (boys n=25, men n=24) or placebo (boys n=25, men n=24). Outcome measures were working memory, response inhibition, response speed, episodic memory, and delay aversion. Differences in task performances over time (pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, following a 1-week wash-out) were compared between age and treatment conditions with mixed ANOVAs. MPH improved working memory and response speed, but only during treatment. No lasting age*treatment effects were observed post intervention. Overall, the results from the present randomized, placebo-controlled trial show that the effects of MPH on cognition do not extend past treatment in children or adults. While treatment with MPH improves cognition during treatment, these effects appear transient after 16-weeks of treatment.
