Study Title: The Effect of Virtual Reality, Music Therapy, and Stress Ball Application on Pain and Anxiety During Outpatient Gynecological Procedures: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of virtual reality, music therapy, and stress ball applications, which are methods of distraction, on pain, anxiety, and patient satisfaction during outpatient gynecological procedures. This study was a randomized controlled trial with control and intervention groups, pre-test and post-test. The study was conducted with 200 women who underwent gynecological surgical procedures without sedation in a state hospital on the European side of Istanbul between October 2022 and March 2023. There were four groups in the study: Virtual Reality (n = 50), Music Therapy (n = 50), Stress Ball (n = 50), and Control group (n = 50). Data were collected using a Descriptive Information Form, Visual Analog Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Life Information Follow-up Form, and Patient Satisfaction Evaluation Form. The scales were completed separately by the investigator before the procedure, 10&#xa0;minutes after the procedure, and 1&#xa0;hour after the procedure. A statistically significant difference between the intervention groups and control groups of women who underwent a gynecological procedure&#xa0;at the 10th minute after the procedure (P=.000) and at the 1st hour after the procedure (P=.000) was significant. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory of women by groups decreased after the procedure and showed a statistically significant difference (P&#xa0;=.000). Satisfaction scores of the women with the intervention according to the groups also showed a significant difference (P&#xa0;=.000). When the satisfaction scores of the women with the intervention were compared by groups, the satisfaction scores ranged from the highest to the lowest, as virtual reality, music therapy, and stress ball application, respectively. Virtual reality, music therapy, and stress ball applications, which are methods of distraction during the outpatient gynecological procedure, were effective in reducing anxiety and pain and increasing patient satisfaction.
