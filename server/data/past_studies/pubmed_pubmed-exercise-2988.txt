Study Title: A novel controlled metabolic accelerator for the treatment of obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Rationale and design of the Phase 2a HuMAIN trial.

Study Summary:
Compared with those without obesity, patients with obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have worse symptoms, haemodynamics, and outcomes. Current weight loss strategies (diet, drug, and surgical) work through decreased energy intake rather than increased expenditure and cause significant loss of skeletal muscle mass in addition to adipose tissue. This may have adverse implications for patients with HFpEF, who already have reduced skeletal muscle mass and function and high rates of physical frailty. Mitochondrial uncoupling agents may have unique beneficial effects by producing weight loss via increased catabolism rather than reduced caloric intake, thereby causing loss of adipose tissue while sparing skeletal muscle. HU6 is a controlled metabolic accelerator that is metabolized to the mitochondrial uncoupling agent 2,4-dinotrophenol. HU6 selectively increases carbon oxidation from fat and glucose while also decreasing toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition to sparing skeletal muscle loss, HU6 may have other benefits relevant to obesity-related HFpEF, including reduced specific tissue depots contributing to HFpEF; improved glucose utilization; and reduction in systemic inflammation via both decreased ROS production from mitochondria and decreased cytokine elaboration from excess, dysfunctional adipose. We describe the rationale and design of HuMAIN-HFpEF, a Phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration, parallel-group trial in patients with obesity-related HFpEF to evaluate the effects of HU6 on weight loss, body composition, exercise capacity, cardiac structure and function, metabolism, and inflammation, and identify optimal dosage for future Phase 3 trials. HuMAIN will test a promising novel agent for obesity-related HFpEF.
