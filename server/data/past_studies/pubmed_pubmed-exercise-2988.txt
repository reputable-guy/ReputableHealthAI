Study Title: 2-Year Outcomes of an Atrial Shunt Device in HFpEF/HFmrEF: Results From REDUCE LAP-HF II.

Study Summary:
The REDUCE LAP-HF II (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart&#xa0;Failure II) trial found that, compared with a sham procedure, the Corvia Atrial Shunt did not improve outcomes in heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction. However, after 12-month follow-up, "responders" (peak-exercise pulmonary vascular resistance&#xa0;<1.74 WU and absence of a cardiac rhythm management device) were identified. This study sought to determine: 1) the overall efficacy and safety of the atrial shunt vs sham control after 2 years of follow-up; and 2) whether the benefits of atrial shunting are sustained in responders during longer-term follow-up or are offset by adverse effects of the shunt. The study analyzed 2-year outcomes in the overall REDUCE LAP-HF II trial, as well as in responder and nonresponder subgroups. The primary endpoint was a hierarchical composite of cardiovascular death or nonfatal ischemic/embolic stroke, total heart failure events, and change in health status. In 621 randomized patients, there was no difference between the shunt (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;309) and sham (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;312) groups in the primary endpoint (win ratio: 1.01 [95%&#xa0;CI: 0.82-1.24]) or its individual components at 2 years. Shunt patency at 24&#xa0;months was 98% in shunt-treated patients. Cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal ischemic stroke were not different between the groups; however, major adverse cardiac events were more common in those patients assigned to the shunt compared with sham (6.9% vs 2.7%; P = 0.018). More patients randomized to the shunt had an increase in right ventricular volume of&#xa0;&#x2265;30% compared with the sham control (39% vs 28%, respectively; P&#xa0;< 0.001), but right ventricular dysfunction was uncommon and not different between the treatment groups. In responders (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;313), the shunt was superior to sham (win ratio: 1.36 [95%&#xa0;CI: 1.02-1.83]; P = 0.037, with 51% fewer HF events [incidence rate ratio: 0.49 [95%&#xa0;CI: 0.25-0.95]; P = 0.034]). In nonresponders (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;265), atrial shunting was inferior to sham (win ratio: 0.73 [95%&#xa0;CI: 0.54-0.98]). At 2 years of follow-up in REDUCE LAP-HF II, there was no difference in efficacy between the atrial shunt and sham groups in the overall trial group. The potential clinical benefit identified in the responder group after 1 and 2 years of follow-up is currently being evaluated in the RESPONDER-HF (Re-Evaluation of the Corvia Atrial Shunt Device in a Precision Medicine Trial to Determine Efficacy in Mildly Reduced or Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart&#xa0;Failure) trial. (Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart&#xa0;Failure II [REDUCE LAP-HF II]; NCT03088033).
