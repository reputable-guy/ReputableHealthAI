Study Title: Fostering healthy aging through selective nutrition: A long-term comparison of two dietary patterns and their holistic impact on mineral status in middle-aged individuals-A randomized controlled intervention trial in Germany.

Study Summary:
Aging is associated with a decline in physiological functions and an increased risk of age-related diseases, emphasizing the importance of identifying dietary strategies for healthy aging. Minerals play a crucial role in maintaining optimal health during aging, making them relevant targets for investigation. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the effect of different dietary pattern on mineral status in the elderly. We included 502 individuals aged 50-80 years in a 36-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) (NutriAct study). This article focuses on the results within the two-year intervention period. NutriAct is not a mineral-modulating-targeted intervention study, rather examining nutrition in the context of healthy aging in general. However, mineral status might be affected in an incidental manner. Participants were assigned to either NutriAct dietary pattern (proportionate intake of total energy consumption (%E) of 35-45&#x202f;%E carbohydrates, 35-40&#x202f;%E fats, and 15-25&#x202f;%E protein) or the German Nutrition Society (DGE) dietary pattern (proportionate intake of total energy consumption (%E) of 55&#x202f;%E carbohydrates, 30&#x202f;%E fats, and 15&#x202f;%E protein), differing in the composition of macronutrients. Data from 368 participants regarding dietary intake (energy, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc) and serum mineral concentrations of calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine, and manganese, free zinc, and selenoprotein P were analyzed at baseline, as well as after 12 and 24 months to gain comprehensive insight into the characteristics of the mineral status. Additionally, inflammatory status - sensitive to changes in mineral status - was assessed by measurement of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. At baseline, inadequate dietary mineral intake and low serum concentrations of zinc and selenium were observed in both dietary patterns. Throughout two years, serum zinc concentrations decreased, while an increase of serum selenium, manganese and magnesium concentrations was observable, likely influenced by both dietary interventions. No significant changes were observed for serum calcium, iron, copper, or iodine concentrations. In conclusion, long-term dietary interventions can influence serum mineral concentrations in a middle-aged population. Our findings provide valuable insights into the associations between dietary habits, mineral status, and disease, contributing to dietary strategies for healthy aging.
