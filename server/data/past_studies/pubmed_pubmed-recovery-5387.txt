Study Title: [Efficacy of transdermal lidocaine 5% patches in postoperative analgesia following knee arthroscopy].

Study Summary:
knee arthroscopy is a common orthopedic procedure associated with postoperative pain, so optimizing pain management is essential for patient recovery and satisfaction. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic with well-established safety profiles, offers a potential alternative to traditional analgesic methods. Research regarding lidocaine patches has been conducted in several types of surgeries (laparoscopy, gynecological surgery, prostatectomy, etc.) showing promising results for some. This study investigates the effectiveness of transdermal lidocaine 5% patches as a novel approach to postoperative analgesia after knee arthroscopy. a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with participants undergoing knee arthroscopy. Patients were divided into two groups: one receiving transdermal lidocaine 5% patches and the other a placebo, both along traditional postoperative pain management, and using opioid only in cases with moderate-severe pain. Pain scores, opioid consumption, and patient-reported outcomes were assessed at various postoperative intervals. there was a significant reduction in pain scores and opioid consumption in the lidocaine patch group compared to the placebo group. transdermal lidocaine 5% patches emerge as a promising adjunct to postoperative pain management in knee arthroscopy patients. Their ease of application, minimal side effects, and opioid-sparing effects contribute to a multifaceted analgesic approach. This study underscores the potential of transdermal lidocaine patches in enhancing the overall postoperative experience for knee arthroscopy patients, advocating for their consideration in clinical practice.
