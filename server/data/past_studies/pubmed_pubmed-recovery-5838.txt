Study Title: Effect of Rehabilitation Intervention Based on Motive Behavioral Conversion Concept on Healing, Self-management, and Quality of Life in Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers after Artificial Dermal Transplantation.

Study Summary:
This study aims to evaluate the effect of rehabilitation interventions based on the motive behavioral conversion concept on diabetic foot ulcer patients after artificial dermal transplantation. The focus is on enhancing self-management and quality of life by integrating intrinsic motivation and behavioral changes in postoperative care. It also aims to introduce and clarify this concept for readers less familiar with this approach in diabetic foot ulcer rehabilitation. The study involved 102 diabetic foot ulcer patients who had undergone artificial dermal transplantation, randomly divided into a control and an observation group. Both groups received standard post-surgical care including antimicrobial agents with alginate supplements and closed negative pressure drainage therapy. The control group underwent conventional rehabilitation, while the observation group received rehabilitation based on motivational behavior transformation. Key evaluation metrics included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, frequency/time of dressing changes, wound healing time, incidence of adverse events, self-care ability scores, and Diabetes-Specific Quality of Life (DSQL) scores, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of outcomes between the two groups. Before the intervention, there was no significant difference in the VAS pain scores between the groups. However, after 7, 10, and 14 days of intervention, the observation group showed a greater reduction in VAS pain scores. The observation group also had shorter dressing change times (12.77 &#xb1; 2.18 minutes) and wound healing times (25.77 &#xb1; 2.94 days) compared to the control group (16.56 &#xb1; 3.25 minutes for dressing change, 27.85 &#xb1; 3.26 days for wound healing). There were no significant differences in the frequency of dressing changes or the cumulative incidence of adverse events between the groups. After 6 months, the observation group demonstrated higher self-care ability scores in several domains and lower total DSQL scores, indicating better outcomes in quality of life dimensions. Rehabilitation interventions based on the motive behavioral conversion concept significantly enhanced postoperative recovery, demonstrating potential implications for clinical practices and future research.
