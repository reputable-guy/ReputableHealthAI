Study Title: Low Energy Intake Leads to Body Composition and Performance Decrements in a Highly-Trained, Female Athlete: The WANDER (Woman's Activity and Nutrition during an Extensive Hiking Route) Case Study.

Study Summary:
This case study's purpose was to quantify energy intake vs energy expenditure during a thru-hiker's trek and assess its relationship to performance and health. A highly trained, female thru-hiker (Age (yrs): 62, Ht (cm): 157, Wt (kg): 53.5, BMI (kg/m): 21.7, %BF: 26.0) embarked on a 4-month journey through the Pacific Crest Trail, USA. The athlete's body composition and 3-day diet record were assessed before (PRE) and after the hike (POST). During the hike, she tracked her diet and performance daily and completed a wellness survey each time she reached a town-check point. Data were analyzed for descriptive (weekly averages, means&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD) and frequency statistics. She spent 10 wk (&#x223c;70&#x2009;days) on the trail and hiked 1,506.35&#x2009;km (26.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.2&#x2009;km/day) with an estimated energy expenditure of &#x223c;2334&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;351&#x2009;kcal/day. During the hike, she under consumed calories (1285.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;103&#x2009;kcal) and dietary carbohydrate (169.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;19.5g), fat (49.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.8g), protein (41.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.8g; 0.8&#x2009;g/kg), fiber (11.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.1g) and sodium (1642.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;298.6&#x2009;mg) when compared to ultra-endurance nutrition recommendations. She was unable to complete the trail due to fatigue and anthropometric changes. By POST, she had decreased total mass (PRE: 53.5&#x2009;kg vs POST: 48.4&#x2009;kg), BMI (PRE 21.6 vs POST: 19.5), fat-free mass (PRE: 39.6 vs POST: 38.8), and body fat (PRE: 26% vs POST: 19.6%) when compared to PRE. Trail-related challenges combined with high energy expenditures led to low nutrient intake which contributed to trail-ending injuries and performance decrements. Research aimed at addressing the barriers associated with thru-hike fueling is needed to identify nutritional opportunities to support hikers' performance and reduce injury risks.
