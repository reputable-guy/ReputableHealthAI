Study Title: go4cognition: Combined Physiological and Cognitive Intervention in Mild Cognitive Impairment.

Study Summary:
While cognitive interventions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) show positive effects on cognitive performance, physical activity appear to slow down cognitive decline, suggesting a relationship between both factors. However, previous combined programs that have shown significant improvement in cognitive function in MCI have typically trained cognition and physical functioning separately. This project aimed at evaluating two group interventions combining the stimulation of physical and cognitive domains in individuals with MCI: Simultaneous stimulation of physical and cognitive skills in comparison to a standardized training, which stimulates cognitive and physical functions separately. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The first group was trained on the SpeedCourt&#xae; system while the second group completed the standardized Fitfor100 program. Training was completed by a total of 39 subjects with diagnosed MCI as determined by the CERAD (SpeedCourt&#xae;: 24 subjects, Fitfor100:15 individuals). There were significant improvements of physical factors (e.g., hand strength and balance) in both groups. Improvement in the CERAD total score allowed for a post interventional classification of all participants into non-MCI and MCI. This effect persisted over a period of three months. Both forms of intervention were found to be effective in improving various cognitive functions which persisted for a period of three months. Both evaluated non-pharmacological, multicomponent interventions, which combined physical and cognitive training in a social setting showed improvement of cognitive functions leading to a persistent classification of former MCI patients in non-MCI patients.
