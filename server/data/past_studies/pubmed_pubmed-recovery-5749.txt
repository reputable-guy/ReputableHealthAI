Study Title: Efficacy and safety of a topical skincare regimen containing CE Ferulic serum and resveratrol BE serum following ablative fractional COlaser treatment: A prospective, randomized, split-face, controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Ablative fractional COlaser is widely used to address various skin problems, but the treatment often leads to adverse effects such as erythema, dyspigmentation, and extended recovery periods, negatively impacting patients' quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical skincare regimen containing both CE Ferulic serum and Resveratrol BE night serum following fractional COlaser treatment in Chinese population. In this randomized, investigator-blinded, split-face, controlled trial, individuals aged 18-65 undergoing ablative COlaser treatment were randomly assigned to apply CE Ferulic plus resveratrol BE serum (CEF-RBE) to either side of face and normal saline (NS) to the other, for 14 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was erythema index (EI) on day 14, with key secondary endpoints including scabbing detachment time, percentage changes in EI and melanin index (MI), skin hydration, transepidermal water loss, skin sebum content, oedema, and overall subject satisfaction. The study included 51 patients, of whom 29 (56.9%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 29.8 (5.39) years. On day 14, the CEF-RBE side exhibited significantly lower EI than the NS side (308.9 vs. 325.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034). The median (IQR) time (days) for complete scabbing detachment at the CEF-RBE side was 6.0 (5.0-8.0) compared to 6.5 (5.0-9.0) at NS side (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018). Additionally, the CEF-RBE side showed a 7.4% decrease in MI from baseline to day 14, while the NS side experienced a 0.2% increase (&#x394;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-7.6%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044). Throughout the 14-day follow-up, the CEF-RBE side consistently displayed higher skin hydration than the NS side. The study highlighted the benefits of incorporating CEF-RBE following laser treatment in reducing erythema and hyperpigmentation, promoting wound healing, and maintaining skin hydration, although limitations such as contamination and adherence issues should be considered.
