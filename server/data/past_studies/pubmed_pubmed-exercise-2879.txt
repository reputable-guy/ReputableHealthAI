Study Title: Dual-task training is as effective as functional training on the functional fitness of older women: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The interest in approaches that improve older individuals' functional fitness and autonomy is increasing. However, the effects of dual-task training on older women's functional fitness and the comparison with the functional training approach are unclear. Therefore, we compared dual-task and functional training on the functional fitness of older women and the effects of three months of detraining. Sixty-one women performed 16 weeks of dual-task training or functional training. The functional fitness was measured pre-, post-training, and post-detraining, based on the ability to put on and take off a t-shirt, evaluating the mobility of the upper limb, standing-up from the prone position measuring the global functionality, five times sit-to-stand test to assess the lower limbs muscle power, timed up and go to measure the dynamic balance and agility, gallon-jug shelf-transfer to evaluate the global functionality emphasizing the upper limbs and 10&#xa0;m walk test to analyze the gait ability. Dual-task training and functional training generally provided significant small to moderate magnitude performance increases in the put on and take off a t-shirt (dual-task training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35 / functional training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.49), five times sit-to-stand test (dual-task training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41 / functional training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.77), timed up and go (dual-task training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.34 / functional training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78), and gallon-jug shelf-transfer (dual-task training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76 / functional training: d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.82). Only the functional training improved the 10&#xa0;m walk test (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013), and both groups did not change the standing-up from the prone position performance. After the detraining period, both groups kept the adaptations for the gallon-jug shelf-transfer and five times sit-to-stand test. At the same time, only the dual-task training maintained the adaptations for the put on and take off a t-shirt and the functional training for the timed up and go. Sixteen weeks of dual-task and functional training are similarly effective in improving older women's functional fitness, maintaining their benefits even after three months of detraining.
