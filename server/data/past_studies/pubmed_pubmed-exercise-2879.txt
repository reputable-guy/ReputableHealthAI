Study Title: Oxylipin Dynamics Following A Single Bout of Yoga Exercise: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Secondary Analysis.

Study Summary:
Yoga may promote health via a complex modulation of inflammation. Little is known about oxylipins, a class of circulating mediators involved in inflammation resolution.To explore the acute effects of yoga exercise on systemic levels of oxylipins.This is a secondary analysis of a three-arm (high-intensity-yoga: HY,= 10); moderate-intensity-yoga: MY,= 10; and no-intervention-control: CON,= 10) pilot randomized controlled trial employing a single bout of yoga exercise. Blood samples (baseline and 4-timepoint post-intervention) were used for an unbiased metabolipidomic profiling analysis. Net Areas Under the Curve per oxylipin were evaluated for each group.Lipoxin(LX)B4, prostaglandin(PG)D2, and resolvin(Rv)D3 exhibited a greater magnitude of change in HY compared with MY and CON.Findings inform the design of future trials exploring the acute effects of yoga exercise on oxylipins' systemic levels.
