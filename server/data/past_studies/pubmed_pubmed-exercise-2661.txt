Study Title: Workplace Injury Prevention and Wellness Program for Orchestra Musicians: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effect of a workplace injury prevention and wellness program compared to no intervention (control) on musicians' playing-related musculoskeletal pain intensity. The hypothesis was that musicians who completed the program would have a greater reduction in pain intensity than the control group.Pragmatic parallel randomized controlled trial.Sixty-five orchestra musicians were recruited and completed patient-reported outcome measures (primary outcome: pain intensity over 11 months, using the Musculoskeletal Pain Intensity and Interference Questionnaire for Musicians; range: 0-40; lower is better) at baseline, 14 weeks (T1), and 11 months (T2). Following baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 33) or control (n = 32) groups, stratified by instrument and pain prevalence. The intervention group received a 14-week injury prevention and wellness program including education and exercise; the control group received no intervention.Pain intensity means (standard deviation) were 7.8 (6.2), 8.0 (7.5), and 8.6 (5.7) in the control group, and 9.0 (6.6), 5.0 (4.2), and 6.7 (6.6) in the intervention group at T0, T1, and T2, respectively. Using intention-to-treat analyses (3 dropouts, n = 65 analyzed), between-group differences in pain intensity (95% confidence interval) were T1-T0: -4.2 (-7.5, -0.9); T2-T0: -3.7 (-7.1, -0.3), type III (overall)= .03, favoring the intervention group. No adverse events were reported.A workplace injury prevention and wellness program may have a clinically meaningful effect on reducing orchestra musicians' pain intensity..
