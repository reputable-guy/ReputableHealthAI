Study Title: Effects of Wab-WPPEP on post-intensive care syndrome-family in family caregivers of heart valve replacement patients: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effects of a WeChat applet-based whole process psychological empowerment program (Wab-WPPEP) on post-intensive care syndrome-family in family caregivers of heart valve replacement patients. Two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled clinical trial. A tertiary general hospital in Fuzhou, China. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group received Wab-WPPEP, while the control group received routine care. The intervention was implemented from ICU admission to one month post-discharge. The primary outcome was anxiety, while secondary outcomes included depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and quality of life. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0), before ICU transfer (T1), pre-discharge (T2), and one month post-discharge (T3) using standardized questionnaires. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the repeated-measures data. The intervention group exhibited greater improvements in anxiety (T1: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.92, 95&#xa0;% CI: -2.35 to -1.49, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; T2: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.66, 95&#xa0;% CI: -2.03 to -1.29, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; T3: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-3.98, 95&#xa0;% CI: -4.34 to -3.62, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), depression (T1: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.32, 95&#xa0;% CI: -1.79 to -0.85, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; T2: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.70, 95&#xa0;% CI: -2.08 to -1.32, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), and quality of life (T2: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;31.16, 95&#xa0;% CI: 21.35 to 40.98, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) compared to the routine-care group. PTSD scores were also significantly lower in the intervention group (t&#xa0;=&#xa0;-6.454, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Wab-WPPEP significantly reduced anxiety and depression, improved quality of life, and alleviated PTSD symptoms in family caregivers of heart valve replacement patients. Comprehensive psychological interventions should be implemented throughout the ICU stay and recovery period to improve family caregiver well-being.
