Study Title: Comparing autologous blood, corticosteroid, and a combined injection of both for treating lateral epicondylitis: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Because lateral epicondylitis is a common musculoskeletal disorder that affects the forearm's extensor tendons, an effective therapeutic approach should reverse the degeneration and promote regeneration. This study aimed to compare the efficacies of autologous blood (AB) injection, corticosteroid (CS) injection, and a combined injection of both in treating lateral epicondylitis (LE), hypothesizing that the combined approach might offer immediate symptom resolution and a lower recurrence. A total of 120 patients diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis were systematically distributed among three distinct therapeutic injection groups. Those in the AB group were administered 1&#xa0;ml of autologous venous blood mixed with 2&#xa0;ml of 2% prilocaine HCl. Participants in the CS category were given 1&#xa0;ml of 40&#xa0;mg methylprednisolone acetate mixed with 2&#xa0;ml of 2% prilocaine HCl. Meanwhile, patients in the combined group received a mixture containing 1&#xa0;ml each of autologous venous blood and 40&#xa0;mg methylprednisolone acetate along with 1&#xa0;ml of 2% prilocaine HCl. Prior to receiving their respective injections, a comprehensive assessment of all participants was carried out. Follow-up assessments were subsequently conducted on days 15, 30, and 90 utilizing metrics of the patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation (PRTEE) and measurements of hand grip strength (HGS). One patient dropped out from the combined group, and 119 patients completed the trial. No complications were recorded during the course of follow-up. By day 15, all groups had demonstrated significant PRTEE improvement, with CS showing the most pronounced reduction (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). However, the benefits of CS had deteriorated by day 30 and had deteriorated further by day 90. The AB and AB&#xa0;+&#xa0;CS groups demonstrated sustained improvement, with AB&#xa0;+&#xa0;CS revealing the most effective treatment, achieving a clinically significant improvement in 97.4% of the patients. The improved HGS parallelled the functional enhancements, as it was more substantial in the AB and AB&#xa0;+&#xa0;CS groups (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), corroborating the sustained benefits of these treatments. The study concluded that while AB and CS individually offer distinct benefits, a combined AB&#xa0;+&#xa0;CS approach optimizes therapeutic outcomes, providing swift and sustained functional improvement with a lower recurrence rate. These findings have substantial clinical implications, suggesting a balanced, multimodal treatment strategy for enhanced patient recovery in LE. Randomized clinical trial, level 1 evidence.
