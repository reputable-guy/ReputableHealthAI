Study Title: Short-Term Effects of Cold Therapy and Kinesio Taping on Pain Relief and Upper Extremity Functionality in Individuals with Rotator Cuff Tendonitis: A Randomized Study.

Study Summary:
: Rotator cuff tendonitis (RCT) is one of the most common shoulder pathologies. It causes pain, limits shoulder joint movements, and impairs function. Despite various treatment methods, there are currently no specific guidelines regarding the most effective intervention for RCT. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have compared the effects of Kinesio taping (KT) and cold therapy (CT) on individuals with RCT. To this end, this study aimed to investigate and compare the short-term effects of KT and CT on pain relief and upper extremity functionality in individuals with RCT.: One hundred and fourteen individuals were assessed for eligibility. Fifty-two individuals with RCT who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate were randomly allocated into either the KT or the CT group. A standardized home exercise program was given to all the participants. Their pain intensity, upper extremity function, shoulder range of motion (ROM), and grip strength were evaluated initially and after the three days of KT or CT applications.: All the assessment values significantly improved in the KT group. In the CT group, only the pain scores (except for the numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score during activity) were significantly improved in the CT group at the end of the third day of application compared to the initial values (< 0.05). For all the measurement outcomes, the effects of time&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;group interactions were statistically significant (< 0.05) in favor of the KT group, except for the resting pain (= 0.688).: The findings suggest that KT and CT could be used as adjunctive modalities to exercise for resting and night pain relief in patients with RCT. KT also had positive effects on the activity pain, function, ROM, and grip strength. The use of KT along with an exercise program could be a more effective therapeutic choice than the use of CT for improving night pain, activity pain, and upper extremity function during the short-term rehabilitation of RCT patients.
