Study Title: The effect of video-assisted learning on pre-operative knowledge and satisfaction for total knee arthroplasty surgery: a randomised-controlled study.

Study Summary:
Traditionally, surgical procedures are explained through consultations between the surgeon and the patient to ensure informed consent. Patient education enhances engagement and knowledge, aiding informed decision-making. This study aimed to assess the effect of an educational video on preoperative patient knowledge and satisfaction in the context of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) as an adjunct to the consent process. A prospective randomized controlled study involving 100 patients in dedicated elective orthopedic units in UK-based hospitals was conducted. After consultation with a dedicated knee surgeon and a preoperative education day for TKA run by dedicated orthopedic nurse specialists, patients were randomized into one of two limbs (video vs no video) at a 1:1 ratio. The treatment group (video group) was shown a video about the principles and steps of the procedure, including the recovery time. Following this, a 10-point knowledge test was completed, and patients rated their satisfaction with the preoperative education on a scale of 0-10. Patients in the video limb group had a significantly greater mean knowledge score and greater satisfaction with preoperative education than patients who did not view the video. The video group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;49) had a mean knowledge score of 8.73&#x2009;+/-&#x2009;0.159 compared to 7.68&#x2009;+/-&#x2009;0.281 for the nonvideo limb (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The video group had a mean satisfaction score of 9.00&#x2009;+/-&#x2009;0.123 compared to 8.40&#x2009;+/-&#x2009;0.121 for the nonvideo limb group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Video-assisted consent in total knee arthroplasty improves preoperative knowledge and patient satisfaction when used as an adjunct in the consent process. A simple, standardized video, either pre- or post-consultation could reinforce information that the patient receives in a simple effective manner, allowing for true informed consent.
