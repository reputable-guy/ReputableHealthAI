Study Title: Comparative Impact of Core Stabilization vs Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation Exercises on Muscle Activation, Endurance, and Balance in Obese Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of core stabilization exercise (CSE) and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) exercise on core muscle activation, core muscle endurance, proprioception, and balance in 80 obese children. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this single-blind, randomized controlled study, 80 obese children aged 10-13 years were randomly divided into 3 groups. The first group received CSE (n=27) and the second group received PNF exercises (n=27) 3 days a week for 8 weeks. The third group, which was the control group (n=26), received no treatment. Participants were evaluated before treatment (BT) and after treatment (AT) and at follow-up (3 months after treatment). Core muscle activation level was evaluated by Sahrmann Core Stability test (SCST), lumbar core muscle endurance was evaluated by McGill core endurance tests, and lumbar joint position sense (JPS) was evaluated by laser cursor. The single-leg standing balance test (SLSBT) and Y balance test (YBT) were used for static and dynamic balance, respectively. RESULTS AT and at follow-up, core activation, core endurance, JPS, and static balance were significantly different between the groups (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in YBT dominant and non-dominant side mixed reach distances (P>0.05). Clinical effect sizes were higher in the CSE group for all outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS CSE and PNF exercises improve the level of core muscle activation, lumbar core muscle endurance, lumbar JPS, and balance in obese children. However, the results of this study show that CSE are more clinically effective in obese children. The effects decline in the medium term.
