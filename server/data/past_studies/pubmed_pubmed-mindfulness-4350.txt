Study Title: Resting state functional connectivity changes following mindfulness-based stress reduction predict improvements in disease control for patients with asthma.

Study Summary:
The staggering morbidity associated with chronic inflammatory diseases can be reduced by psychological interventions, including Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Proposed mechanisms for MBSR's beneficial effects include changes in salience network function. Salience network perturbations are also associated with chronic inflammation, including airway inflammation in asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting approximately 10% of the population. However, no studies have examined whether MBSR-related improvements in disease control are related to changes in salience network function. Adults with asthma were randomized to 8&#xa0;weeks of MBSR or a waitlist control group. Resting state functional connectivity was measured using fMRI before randomization, immediately post-intervention, and 4&#xa0;months post-intervention. Using key salience network regions as seeds, we calculated group differences in change in functional connectivity over time and examined whether functional connectivity changes were associated with increased mindfulness, improved asthma control, and decreased inflammatory biomarkers. The MBSR group showed greater increases in functional connectivity between salience network regions relative to the waitlist group. Improvements in asthma control correlated with increased functional connectivity between the salience network and regions important for attention control and emotion regulation. Improvements in inflammatory biomarkers were related to decreased functional connectivity between the salience network and other networks. Increased resting salience network coherence and connectivity with networks that subserve attention and emotion regulation may contribute to the benefits of MBSR for patients with asthma. Understanding the neural underpinnings of MBSR-related benefits in patients is a critical step towards optimizing brain-targeted interventions for chronic inflammatory disease management.
