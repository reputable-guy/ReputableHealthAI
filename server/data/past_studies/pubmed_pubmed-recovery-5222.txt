Study Title: The influence of sex on the effects of inorganic nitrate supplementation on muscular power and endurance.

Study Summary:
Inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation increases nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and may improve muscular power and endurance, although most studies are in males. Therefore, the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the effects of [Formula: see text] supplementation on isokinetic peak power, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) force, muscular endurance (time-to-task failure; TTF), and recovery from fatigue in young females (= 12) and males (= 14). Participants consumed &#x223c;13 mmol [Formula: see text] [beetroot juice (BRJ)], or an identical [Formula: see text]-depleted beverage placebo (PL), for &#x223c;3 days and 2 h before testing visits. Plasma nitrate and nitrite were elevated in the BRJ condition (&#x2264; 0.05). Peak power (W&#xb7;kg) showed a sex effect (&#x2264; 0.05) at all angular velocities and a sex-by-treatment effect at 270 and 360&#xb0;/s (&#x2264; 0.05). Post hoc analysis revealed no significant differences between treatments (> 0.05). Estimated maximal knee extension power () and maximal knee extension velocity () demonstrated no sex, treatment, or sex-by-treatment effect (> 0.05). There were no significant effects for TTF (F: PL; 269&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;161 vs. BRJ; 277&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;158 s and M: PL; 228&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;171 vs. BRJ; 194&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;100 s;> 0.05). Cohen'seffect sizes for peak power showed moderate to large effect sizes at 270 (= 0.92) and 360&#xb0;/s (= 0.81), showing a possible differentiated effect of dietary nitrate in females and males. The present data indicate that [Formula: see text] supplementation does not significantly affect knee extensor maximal power, maximal contraction velocity, and muscular endurance in either sex. The sex-dependent response to dietary nitrate supplementation requires further investigation as data on females is scarce.Recent data have suggested that inorganic nitrate ([Formula: see text]) supplementation may benefit males; however, females may experience worsened endurance capacity. This study revealed a potential differentiated effect of [Formula: see text] supplementation on outcomes of muscle contractile function between healthy, young males and females. The specific responses of [Formula: see text] supplementation in females and across sexes remain understudied and require further investigation.
