Study Title: Efficacy of addition of the anti-inflammatory, IV glutathione to standard ketamine IV therapy in major depressive disorder.

Study Summary:
Ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, is used for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Recent studies have shown that there are increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and those with higher levels of oxidative stress markers have a decreased or null response to conventional antidepressants. Glutathione (GSH) as an antioxidant adjuvant to ketamine has not been well studied. This double-blind study with 30 patients divided into 2 groups of 15 each, aimed to determine if GSH, added to standard ketamine infusion (GSH+K), rendered better outcomes in MDD patients versus patients receiving ketamine infusions with a normal saline placebo (K+NS). There were significant drops in BDI-II scores from day 1 to day 14, PHQ- scores from day 1 to day 14 and PHQ-9 scores day 14 to day 28, suggesting the overall treatment was effective. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups over time. However, a sustained improvement in depressive symptoms was observed for 14 days post-infusion in both groups.
