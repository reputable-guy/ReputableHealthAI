Study Title: Relationship between short-term self-reported dietary magnesium intake and whole blood ionized magnesium (iMg) or serum magnesium (s-Mg) concentrations.

Study Summary:
Since we and others have shown that supplemental magnesium raises whole blood ionized magnesium (iMg) we investigated the relationships between self-reported dietary magnesium intake and concentrations of whole blood iMgand serum magnesium (s-Mg). We obtained whole blood iMgconcentrations, as well as s-Mg concentrations, from a pilot, three-arm, randomized, controlled, crossover bioavailability study of magnesium supplements (&#x2009;=&#x2009;23; 105 measures). Dietary magnesium intake was assessed using three-day food records and the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR, University of Minnesota, MN, USA). Whole blood iMgwas measured with an electrode analyser (NOVA Biochemical, Waltham, MA, USA), whereas s-Mg was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. A linear mixed-effects model was employed with dietary magnesium as the outcome variable and iMg, s-Mg, study treatment and study visit as fixed effects. We adjusted age, gender, race and body mass index covariates. Values for dietary magnesium, iMgand s-Mg were 303.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;118.9&#x2009;mg/day, 1.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.1&#x2009;mg/dL and 2.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.1&#x2009;mg/dL, respectively. No association was found between dietary magnesium intake and iMg-125&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;176.95 (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.49) or s-Mg -9.33&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.04 (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.08). Whole blood iMgand s-Mg concentrations do not reflect short-term self-reported dietary intake in adults. Further research is needed to determine whether blood biomarkers of magnesium may reflect dietary magnesium intake.Key messagesDietary intake of magnesium, a shortfall nutrient, may be objectively measured using blood biomarkers of magnesium.Serum magnesium and whole blood iMgwere not associated with short-term dietary intake of magnesium.
