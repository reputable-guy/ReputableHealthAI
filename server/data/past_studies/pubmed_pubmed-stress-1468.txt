Study Title: An Interdisciplinary Intervention Based on Prescription of Physical Activity, Diet, and Positive Mental Health to Promote Healthy Lifestyle in Patients with Obesity: A Randomized Control Trial.

Study Summary:
This study used a multimodal approach to address the issue of obesity among individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 30 and 40 residing in a rural region of north-east Spain. A pretest-posttest model was employed in a clinical trial design, comparing an intervention group with a control group. The intervention, which lasted for a period of nine months, was based on three main strategies: the prescription of physical activity, the promotion of healthy nutritional habits, and the management of emotional wellbeing through Positive Mental Health (PMH). A variety of assessment tools were employed, including the CLASS-AF scale and a stress test for physical activity levels; advanced anthropometry and blood analysis for metabolic and body composition variables; a Mediterranean diet adherence questionnaire for nutritional habits; and a PMH multifactorial questionnaire for the assessment of emotional management. The results revealed significant improvements in the level of physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean diet in favor of the intervention group, where 89.4% (n = 17) of the participants went from being not very active/sedentary to being active. Also, adherence to the Mediterranean diet improved with a mean increase of 2.2 points on the scale [mean: 10.5 (CI 95%: 9.90, 11.09)]. In addition, significant reductions in body fat [mean: -2.50 kg (CI 95%: -3.56, -1.44)] and free fat mass [mean: -3.38% (IC 95%: -4.34, -2.41), along with decreased cholesterol levels (196 vs. 182 mg/dL), were observed, suggesting a decrease in cardiovascular and metabolic risk. In conclusion, this multimodal intervention was effective at improving the lifestyle of people with obesity and reducing their cardiovascular and metabolic risk. The combination of interventions focused on physical activity, diet, Positive Mental Health, and metabolic changes and were perceived as a comprehensive and complementary strategy in obesity care. These findings highlight the importance of approaching this condition from multiple perspectives to ensure optimal health outcomes.
