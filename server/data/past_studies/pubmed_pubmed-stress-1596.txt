Study Title: Examining immune-inflammatory mechanisms of probiotic supplementation in depression: secondary findings from a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
We recently indicated that four-week probiotic supplementation significantly reduced depression along with microbial and neural changes in people with depression. Here we further elucidated the biological modes of action underlying the beneficial clinical effects of probiotics by focusing on immune-inflammatory processes. The analysis included a total of N&#x2009;=&#x2009;43 participants with depression, from which N&#x2009;=&#x2009;19 received the probiotic supplement and N&#x2009;=&#x2009;24 received a placebo over four weeks, in addition to treatment as usual. Blood and saliva were collected at baseline, at post-intervention (week 4) and follow-up (week 8) to assess immune-inflammatory markers (IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, CRP, MIF), gut-related hormones (ghrelin, leptin), and a stress marker (cortisol). Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses were conducted to identify differentially expressed genes. Finally, we analyzed the associations between probiotic-induced clinical and immune-inflammatory changes. We observed a significant group x time interaction for the gut hormone ghrelin, indicative of an increase in the probiotics group. Additionally, the increase in ghrelin was correlated with the decrease in depressive symptoms in the probiotics group. Transcriptomic analyses identified 51 up- and 57 down-regulated genes, which were involved in functional pathways related to enhanced immune activity. We identified a probiotic-dependent upregulation of the genes ELANE, DEFA4 and OLFM4 associated to immune activation and ghrelin concentration. These results underscore the potential of probiotic supplementation to produce biological meaningful changes in immune activation in patients with depression. Further large-scale mechanistic trials are warranted to validate and extend our understanding of immune-inflammatory measures as potential biomarkers for stratification and treatment response in depression.
