Study Title: The dynamics of recovery of external breathing function in patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the acute period under the influence of the rehabilitation program.

Study Summary:
Aim: To determine the dynamics of renewal of the function of external respiration in patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the acute stage of rehabilitation under the influence of a rehabilitation program. Materials and Methods: The study is randomized, simple with blinded assessors. The forced vital capacity (FVC, l), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1, l) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR, l/s) were assessed. Spirometry was performed 120 patients on the first day of admission of patients to the surgical department for surgical intervention, on the second day and on the day of discharge. Methods of mathematical statistics: arithmetic mean (M) and standard error of the mean (}m), Student's t-test were calculated, differences at p<0,05 were considered statistically significant. Results: It has been established that laparoscopic cholecystectomy leads to a statistically significant decrease in the parameters of respiratory function in all age categories. More pronounced positive dynamics of respiratory function in the group of respiratory therapy. It was established that without respiratory therapy on the day of discharge there was no restoration (&#x440;<0.05) in groups of elderly patients of group of FVC l, FEV1 l, PEFR l/s; in middle-aged patients did no restoration FEV1, l, PEFR, l/s; in younger patients there was no recovery of FEV1, l. Conclusions: The results of the study indicate the effectiveness of the introduction of diaphragmatic breathing exercises in combination with early mobilization at the acute and subacute stages of rehabilitation in patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in order to restore the function of the respiratory system.
