Study Title: Evaluation of a Sparkling Water Promotion Intervention on Sales at Convenience Stores in the Southeastern US.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the feasibility of in-store signage promoting sparkling water and the impact of this signage on sparkling water sales in convenience stores. We conducted a randomized control trial. Convenience stores in North Carolina. Twenty-four convenience stores in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-eligible households. The 24 eligible stores were randomized to receive the in-store signage promoting sparkling water or to the control condition of no change. One poster was hung on the beverage cooler doors in front of the sparkling water selections at each of the 12 participating stores. Weekly sales data and fidelity checks were collected. The primary outcome measure was sales of total water, and the subanalysis was sales of sparkling water. T tests were conducted to assess changes in total water and sparkling water sales between intervention and control stores. In-store signage did not significantly increase sales of sparkling water, or all water, during the intervention. Signage alone may not be enough to impact healthy beverage purchasing, and signage should be paired with other promotional components to increase healthy beverage purchases in convenience stores.
