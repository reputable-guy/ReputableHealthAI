Study Title: Objective sleep enhancement in Parkinson's disease: A sham-controlled trial of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Study Summary:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by sleep disturbances, impacting patients' quality of life. While repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) shows promise in improving self-reported sleep quality, its effects on objective sleep architecture in PD remain understudied. Sleep disturbances, including rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep disturbances, correlate with cognitive decline and motor symptoms. This study investigated the effect of low-frequency rTMS targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) modifying objective sleep architecture and explored symptom improvement mechanisms in PD patients. In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, 67 PD patients received 10 consecutive days of 1-Hz rTMS over the right DLPFC. Polysomnography assessed sleep microstructure, while electroencephalogram recordings evaluated power spectral density and sleep spindle activity. Clinical scales measured sleep quality, motor symptoms, and cognition at baseline, post-treatment, and 3 months post-rTMS. The rTMS group exhibited improvements in sleep quality, motor symptoms, and cognition post-treatment, persisting at the 3-month follow-up. There was a notable increase in the REM sleep proportion post-rTMS. The rTMS group exhibited elevated low-frequency (0.5-2&#xa0;Hz) slow-wave electroencephalogram spectral density during non-REM sleep. Cognitive enhancement correlated with increased lower delta power, while motor symptom progression correlated with spindle frequency and slow-wave sleep percentage changes. Low-frequency rTMS targeting the right DLPFC holds promise for improving clinical symptoms and modulating sleep architecture in PD. These findings suggest a link between symptom improvement and sleep structure enhancement, highlighting the need for further investigation into the therapeutic potential of rTMS in PD management.
