Study Title: Personalized Postacute Hospitalization Recovery: A Novel Intervention to Improve Patient Experience and Reduce Cost.

Study Summary:
Readmissions are a significant financial burden for payers. Cardiovascular-related discharges are particularly prone to readmission. Posthospital discharge support can impact patient recovery and probably reduce patient readmissions. This study aimed to address the underlying behavioral and psychosocial factors that can negatively affect patients after discharge. The study population was adult patients admitted to the hospital with a cardiovascular diagnosis who had a plan to discharge home. Those who consented to participate were randomized to intervention or control groups on a 1:1 basis. The intervention group received behavioral and emotional support, whereas the control group received usual care. Interventions included motivational interviewing, patient activation, empathetic communication, addressing mental health and substance use, and mindfulness. Observed total readmission costs were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group ($1.1 million vs. $2.0 million) as was the observed mean cost per readmitted patient ($44,052 vs. $91,278). The mean expected cost of readmission after adjustment for confounding variables was lower in the intervention group than in the control group ($8,094 vs. $9,882, p = .011). Readmissions are a costly spend category. In this study, posthospital discharge support addressing the psychosocial factors contributing to patients' readmissions resulted in a lower total cost of care for those with a cardiovascular diagnosis. We describe an intervention that is reproducible and can be scaled broadly through technology to reduce readmission costs.
