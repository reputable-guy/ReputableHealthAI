Study Title: Correlation properties of heart rate variability for exercise prescription during prolonged running at constant speeds: A randomized cross-over trial.

Study Summary:
The study explores the validity of the nonlinear index alpha 1 of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFAa1) of heart rate (HR) variability for exercise prescription in prolonged constant load running bouts of different intensities. 21 trained endurance athletes (9&#xa0;w and 12&#xa0;m) performed a ramp test for ventilatory threshold (vVT1 and vVT2) and DFAa1-based (vDFAa1-1 at 0.75 and vDFAa1-2 at 0.5) running speed detection as well as two 20-min running bouts at vDFAa1-1 and vDFAa1-2 (20-vDFAa1-1 and 20-vDFAa1-2), in which HR, oxygen consumption (VO), respiratory frequency (RF), DFAa1, and blood lactate concentration [La-] were assessed. 20-vDFAa1-2 could not be finished by all participants (finisher group (FG), n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15 versus exhaustion group (EG), n&#xa0;=&#xa0;6). Despite similar mean external loads of vDFAa1-1 (10.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;km/h) and vDFAa1-2 (13.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;km/h) for all participants compared to vVT1 (10.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.7&#xa0;km/h) and vVT2 (13.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;km/h), considerable differences were present for 20-vDFAa1-2 in EG (15.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;km/h). 20-vDFAa1-1 and 20-DFAa1-2 yielded significant differences in FG for HR (76.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.7 vs. 86.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.9 %HR), VO(62.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.0 vs. 77.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8.6 %VO), RF (40.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;11.3 vs. 46.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9.8&#xa0;bpm), DFA-a1 (0.86&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.23 vs. 0.60&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.15), and [La-] (1.41&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.45 vs. 3.34&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.24&#xa0;mmol/L). Regarding alterations during 20-vDFAa1-1, all parameters showed small changes for all participants, while during 20-vDFAa1-2 RF and DFAa1 showed substantial alterations in FG (RF: 15.6% and DFAa1: -12.8%) and more pronounced in EG (RF: 20.1% and DFAa1: -35.9%). DFAa1-based exercise prescription from incremental testing could be useful for most participants in prolonged running bouts, at least in the moderate to heavy intensity domain. In addition, an individually different increased risk of overloading may occur in the heavy to severe exercise domains and should be further elucidated in the light of durability and decoupling assessment.
