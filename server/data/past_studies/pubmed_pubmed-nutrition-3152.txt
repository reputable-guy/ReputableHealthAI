Study Title: Skin-interfaced microfluidic biosensors for colorimetric measurements of the concentrations of ketones in sweat.

Study Summary:
Ketones, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), are important metabolites that can be used to monitor for conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and ketosis. Compared to conventional approaches that rely on samples of urine or blood evaluated using laboratory techniques, processes for monitoring of ketones in sweat using on-body sensors offer significant advantages. Here, we report a class of soft, skin-interfaced microfluidic devices that can quantify the concentrations of BHB in sweat based on simple and low-cost colorimetric schemes. These devices combine microfluidic structures and enzymatic colorimetric BHB assays for selective and accurate analysis. Human trials demonstrate the broad applicability of this technology in practical scenarios, and they also establish quantitative correlations between the concentration of BHB in sweat and in blood. The results represent a convenient means for managing DKA and aspects of personal nutrition/wellness.
