Study Title: Increasing physical activity among adults affected by COVID-19 social distancing restrictions: A feasibility trial of an online intervention.

Study Summary:
In response to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, digitally delivered health interventions present as a potential solution for maintaining or improving individuals' physical activity. This study explored the feasibility of a web-based intervention, informed by the multi-process action control (M-PAC) framework to promote PA among individuals affected by social distancing. Fifty adults self-reporting as insufficiently active were randomized to a 6-week web-intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) or wait-list control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23). Primary feasibility outcomes included recruitment and retention rates and usability and satisfaction scores; secondary outcomes of MVPA and M-PAC constructs and tertiary outcomes of mental health and wellbeing were also assessed. Overall, feasibility of the intervention was high, with a 96% recruitment rate, 84% retention rate, high satisfaction and usability scores, and comparable website usage to similar eHealth interventions. Intervention participants trended towards improved MVPA and M-PAC constructs and outcomes of mental health and wellbeing. Findings suggest study extension to a full-scale RCT.
