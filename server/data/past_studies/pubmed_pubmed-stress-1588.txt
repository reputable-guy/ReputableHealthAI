Study Title: Effects of online mindful self-compassion intervention on negative body image in breast cancer patients: A randomized controlled trail.

Study Summary:
The incidence of breast cancer patients with negative body image has increased. However, research on interventions that explicitly reduce negative body image among breast cancer patients remains inadequate. The development of more pragmatic interventions is imperative. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the effectiveness of a 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) intervention to reduce the negative body image in breast cancer patients. We randomly assigned 64 female breast cancer patients to either the MSC group or the control group. The MSC group received a 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion intervention, while the control group received no psychological training. Participants were surveyed by the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF), the Self-Acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ), the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and the Body Image Scale (BIS) at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 1-month follow-up (T3). All outcome variables demonstrated significant time main effects and nonsignificant group main effects. The MSC and control groups had significant time&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;group interaction effects on self-compassion, self-acceptance, perceived stress, and negative body image. Simple main effects analysis revealed significant improvements in outcome variables at three-time points for the MSC group. A 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion intervention can improve self-compassion and self-acceptance and reduce perceived stress and negative body image among the breast cancer patients in MSC group. Mindful Self-Compassion intervention shows promise as a viable way to maintain the mental well-being of breast cancer patients.
