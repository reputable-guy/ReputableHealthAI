Study Title: High-dose short-term creatine supplementation without beneficial effects in professional cyclists: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Growing evidence supports the ergogenic effects of creatine supplementation on muscle power/strength, but its effects on endurance performance remain unclear. We assessed the effects of high-dose short-term creatine supplementation in professional cyclists during a training camp. The study followed a double-blind, randomized parallel design. Twenty-three professional U23 cyclists (19&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1&#x2009;years, maximum oxygen uptake: 73.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.6&#x2009;mL/kg/min) participated in a 6-day training camp. Participants were randomized to consume daily either a recovery drink (containing carbohydrates and protein) with a 20-g creatine supplement (creatine group,&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) or just the recovery drink (placebo group,&#x2009;=&#x2009;12). Training loads and dietary intake were monitored, and indicators of fatigue/recovery (Hooper index, countermovement jump height), body composition, and performance (10-second sprint, 3-, 6-, and 12-minute time trials, respectively, as well as critical power and W') were assessed as study outcomes. The training camp resulted in a significant (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) increase of training loads (+50% for total training time and&#x2009;+&#x2009;61% for training stress score, compared with the preceding month) that in turn induced an increase in fatigue indicators (significant time effect [&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001] for delayed-onset muscle soreness, fatigue, and total Hooper index) and a decrease in performance (significant time effect [&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.020] for critical power, which decreased by -3.8%). However, no significant group-by-time interaction effect was found for any of the study outcomes (all&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). High-dose short-term creatine supplementation seems to exert no consistent beneficial effects on recovery, body composition or performance indicators during a strenuous training period in professional cyclists.
