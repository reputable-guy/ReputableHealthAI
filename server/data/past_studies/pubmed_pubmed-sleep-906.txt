Study Title: The Effect of Training Given to Patients with Septorhinoplasty on Nose Obstruction and Sleep Quality: A Randomized Controlled Prospective Trial.

Study Summary:
Clinical nurses play a primary role in the surgical adjustment of patients, to include monitoring and training patients in septorhinoplasty, which has a long recovery period. The effect of repetitive patient training nasal obstruction and sleep quality is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of repetitive training given to patients undergoing septorhinoplasty on nasal obstruction and sleep quality. The study is a randomized controlled prospective study. The study was conducted on a total of 180 patients (intervention: 90, control: 90) who underwent septorhinoplasty. In the intervention group, repeated training was given before and after (12 months) septorhinoplasty. The control group received routine care. Data were collected with Personal Information Form, Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A total of 66.7% of the intervention group and 71.1% of the control group reported that the primary symptom triggering the operation was the inability to breathe through the nose. The intervention group's PSQI and NOSE scale total score averages in the 6th and 12th months after septorhinoplasty were significantly lower than the control group. Correlation revealed a moderate-to-strong and positive correlation between PSQI and NOSE scores. Results supported that repetitive training was effective in reducing nasal obstruction symptoms and improving sleep quality in the intervention group compared to the control group.
