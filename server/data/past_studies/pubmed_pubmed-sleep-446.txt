Study Title: Low- versus High-Glycemic Index Mediterranean-Style Eating Patterns Improved Some Domains of Health-Related Quality of Life but Not Sleep in Adults at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes: The MEDGICarb Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
A healthy eating pattern such as the Mediterranean-style healthy eating pattern (MED-HEP) is associated with favorable effects on both cardiometabolic risk markers and self-reported health outcomes. Limited evidence exists regarding the influence of the glycemic index (GI) of carbohydrate foods consumed within a healthy eating pattern on self-reported health status and sleep. To investigate the effects of a low- compared with high-GI MED-HEP on changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and sleep. The MEDGICarb-intervention trial is a 12-wk randomized, controlled, parallel multi-center trial in adults with &#x2265;2 features of the metabolic syndrome. Participants consumed an eu-energetic diet profiled as a MED-HEP with either low GI (experimental) or high GI (control). HRQoL and sleep were measured with Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey version 2, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale at baseline and postintervention. One hundred and sixty adults with &#x2265;2 features of the metabolic syndrome completed the intervention [53% females, age 56 &#xb1; 10 y, body mass index (kg/m) 31.0 &#xb1; 3.1]. Low- compared with high-GI MED-HEP resulted in differential changes between the groups in the HRQoL domains role physical [5.6 &#xb1; 2.2 arbitrary units (AU) compared with -2.5 &#xb1; 2.5 AU) and vitality (6.9 &#xb1; 1.7 AU compared with 0.0 &#xb1; 1.8 AU] (P < 0.05), which were driven mostly by improvements in the low-GI group. There were no significant differences between the MED-HEPs for changes in aggregated physical or mental components or for the other individual domains of HRQoL (physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health) or for sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. Low compared to high GI in the context of a MED-HEP resulted in modest improvements in some, but not all, health domains of HRQoL. No major differences were seen between the groups for measures of sleep. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03410719.
