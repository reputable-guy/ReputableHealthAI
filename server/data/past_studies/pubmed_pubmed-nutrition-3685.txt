Study Title: Improvements in dietary intake, behaviors, and psychosocial measures in a community-randomized cardiovascular disease risk reduction intervention: Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities 2.0.

Study Summary:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence has disproportionately risen among midlife and older female adults of rural communities, partly due to poor diet and diet-related behaviors and psychosocial factors that impede healthy eating. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Strong Hearts Healthy Communities 2.0 (SHHC-2.0) on secondary diet-related outcomes between intervention and control participants that align with the dietary goal and behavioral aims of the SHHC-2.0, a CVD risk reduction program. A community-randomized controlled trial was conducted in rural, medically underserved communities. Participants were female adults &#x2265;40 y who were classified as obese or both overweight and sedentary. Communities were randomized to SHHC-2.0 intervention (n = 5 communities; n = 87 participants) or control (with delayed intervention) (n = 6 communities; n = 95 participants). SHHC-2.0 consisted of 24 wk of twice-weekly experiential nutrition education and group-based physical activity classes led by local health educators. Changes between baseline and end point (24 wk) in dietary intake (24-h recalls), dietary behaviors (e.g., Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants-Short Version [REAP-S] scores) and diet-related psychosocial measures (e.g., Three Factor Eating questionnaire) between groups were analyzed using linear mixed-effects multilevel models. At 24 wk, participants from the 5 intervention communities, compared with controls, consumed fewer calories (mean difference [MD]= -211 kcal, 95% CI: -412, -110, P = 0.039), improved overall dietary patterns measured by REAP-S scores (MD: 3.9; 95% CI: 2.26, 5.6; P < 0.001), and improved psychosocial measures (healthy eating attitudes, uncontrolled eating, cognitive restraint, and emotional eating). SHHC-2.0 has strong potential to improve diet patterns and diet-related psychosocial wellbeing consistent with improved cardiovascular health. This trial was registered at www. gov as NCT03059472.
