Study Title: The living centre: an innovative open-access model of breast cancer survivorship care.

Study Summary:
People affected by breast cancer experience a multitude of&#xa0;toxicities and unmet needs across physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and economic domains that adversely impact their quality of life. High-quality and diverse supportive care is required to improve outcomes and rehabilitation for people affected by breast cancer. However, the availability and access to high-quality supportive care services is limited due to factors including cost and demand. As such, many people affected by breast cancer do not receive optimal supportive care. The Think Pink Foundation facilitates free-of-charge supportive care services to breast cancer survivors, their families, and caregivers through 'The Living Centre'. Think Pink seeks to provide a high-quality survivorship care model that overcomes barriers associated with the economic burden of cancer. Within its suite of services, The Living Centre offers ongoing exercise classes, creative therapy, support groups, specialist breast cancer nurse consultations, wellness services, and education support through face-to-face and online service provision. This paper outlines the development, model of care, service provision, and planning for future outcomes and economic evaluation of The Living Centre as a supportive care model for others to consider establishing in their local context. This paper may therefore directly inform the development of cancer survivorship care services globally to increase equitable access to optimal supportive care.
