Study Title: Surgical masks and filtering facepiece class 2 respirators (FFP2) have no major physiological effects at rest and during moderate exercise at 3000-m altitude: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face masks has been recommended or enforced in several situations; however, their effects on physiological parameters and cognitive performance at high altitude are unknown. Eight healthy participants (four females) rested and exercised (cycling, 1&#xa0;W/kg) while wearing no mask, a surgical mask or a filtering facepiece class 2 respirator (FFP2), both in normoxia and hypobaric hypoxia corresponding to an altitude of 3000&#xa0;m. Arterialised oxygen saturation (SaO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2), heart and respiratory rate, pulse oximetry (SpO2), cerebral oxygenation, visual analogue scales for dyspnoea and mask's discomfort were systematically investigated. Resting cognitive performance and exercising tympanic temperature were also assessed. Mask use had a significant effect on PaCO2 (overall +1.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.7&#xa0;mmHg). There was no effect of mask use on all other investigated parameters except for dyspnoea and discomfort, which were highest with FFP2. Both masks were associated with a similar non-significant decrease in SaO2 during exercise in normoxia (-0.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4%) and, especially, in hypobaric hypoxia (-1.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5%), with similar trends for PaO2 and SpO2. Although mask use was associated with higher rates of dyspnoea, it had no clinically relevant impact on gas exchange at 3000&#xa0;m at rest and during moderate exercise, and no detectable effect on resting cognitive performance. Wearing a surgical mask or an FFP2 can be considered safe for healthy people living, working or spending their leisure time in mountains, high-altitude cities or other hypobaric environments (e.g. aircrafts) up to an altitude of 3000&#xa0;m.
