Study Title: Is it safe and feasible to use multi-lateral-pores drainage strategy after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery?

Study Summary:
Evidence-based studies optimizing chest tube management have been conducted to accelerate the recovery process for lung cancer patients after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This study is to evaluate whether using the multi-lateral pores chest tube can achieve better drainage performance than conventional-lateral-pore drainage. Data from patients undergoing VATS were consecutively collected from September 2023 to June 2024. The groups were randomized into two subgroups, which were multi-lateral-pores drainage group (MDG) and conventional-lateral-pore drainage group (CDG). The primary outcomes included chest drainage performance, and the secondary outcomes included postoperative complications (PPCs). After screening, 228 patients were randomized into two groups, in which 116 patients in MDG and 112 patients in CDG. The daily drainage volume [199.70 (95%CI: 165.19~234.99) mL/d vs 149.43 (95%CI: 120.70~179.21) mL/d, P<0.01] and total drainage volume [342.79 (95%CI: 291.91~392.63) mL vs 272.68 (95%CI: 225.87~322.11) mL, P = 0.04] in the MDG was significantly higher that that in the CDG. The drainage duration in the MDG was also less than that in the CDG [36.41 (95%CI: 32.23~40.72) h vs 51.02 (95%CI: 46.03~56.38) h, P < 0.01]. The incidence of pleural effusion was lower in the MDG when compared with that in CDG (1.7% vs 9.0%, P = 0.04). No differences were found in the other incidences of chest tube-related PPCs, including pneumothorax (12.0% vs 15.2%, P = 0.15) and subcutaneous emphysema (17.2% vs 17.9%, P = 0.35), however. Based on this single-center analysis, multi-lateral pores chest tube provided better drainage performance after VATS.
