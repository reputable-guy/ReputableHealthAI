Study Title: Patients and Providers Win with a Collaborative Community-Based, Health Education and Wellness Program.

Study Summary:
At the downturn of the COVID-19 pandemic, JPS Health Network sought creative ways to ramp up services and reengage patients in care. The network's strategies for population health management, community engagement, and access to care came together in 2022 with the initial development of the JPS Health and Wellness Program. Today, the program supports patients-particularly those most in need-in navigating the continuum of care. Offerings include classes and resources covering behavioral health, heart disease, diabetes, COVID-19, nutrition, and injury prevention. The program also provides referrals to partner agencies to address social determinants of health. Another important aspect of the JPS Health and Wellness Program is its role in workforce development to accommodate these vital new offerings.
