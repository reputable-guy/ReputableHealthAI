Study Title: The effects of acute dopamine reuptake inhibition on cognitive function during passive hyperthermia.

Study Summary:
Dopamine activity can modulate physical performance in the heat, but less is known about its effects on cognition during thermal stress. Twelves males completed a randomized, double-blinded protocol consisting of oral ingestion of 20 mg of methylphenidate (MPH) or placebo (lactose pill) during passive heating using a water-perfused suit (water temperature &#x223c;49&#x2009;&#xb0;C). To identify the impact of peripheral versus central thermal strain, a cognitive test battery was completed at 4 different thermal states: baseline (BASE; 37.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6&#x2009;&#xb0;C core, 32.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.7&#x2009;&#xb0;C skin), neutral core-hot skin (NC-HS; 37.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.3&#x2009;&#xb0;C, 37.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.3&#x2009;&#xb0;C), hyperthermic core-hot skin (HC-HS; 38.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4&#x2009;&#xb0;C, 38.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.2&#x2009;&#xb0;C), and hyperthermic core-cooled skin (HC-CS; 38.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4&#x2009;&#xb0;C, 35.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.8&#x2009;&#xb0;C). The cognitive test battery consisted of the 2-back task (i.e., working memory), set-shifting (i.e., executive function), Groton Maze Learning Task (i.e., executive function) and detection task (i.e., psychomotor processing). MPH led to significantly higher heart rates (&#x223c;5-15 b&#xb7;min) at BASE, NC-HS, and HC-HS (all< 0.05). There were no significant differences in the number of errors made on each task (all< 0.05). Participants were significantly faster (< 0.05) on the set-shifting task in the HC-HS timepoint, irrespective of drug condition (> 0.05). In summary, we demonstrated that 20 mg of MPH did not significantly alter cognitive function during either normothermia or moderate hyperthermia.Twenty milligrams of MPH did not significantly alter cognitive function during passive heat stress. MPH led to significant higher heart rates (&#x223c;5-15 b&#xb7;min) in thermoneutral and during passive heat stress. Future studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of why MPH improves physical but not cognitive performance during heat stress.
