Study Title: A 12-Week Randomized Intervention Comparing the Healthy US, Mediterranean, and Vegetarian Dietary Patterns of the US Dietary Guidelines for Changes in Body Weight, Hemoglobin A1c, Blood Pressure, and Dietary Quality among African American Adults.

Study Summary:
The US Dietary Guidelines (USDG) form the basis of nutrition guidelines, but the research informing the 3 USDG dietary patterns (Healthy US-Style [H-US], Mediterranean [Med], and vegetarian [Veg]) has been drawn largely from observational studies among White populations. The Dietary Guidelines 3 Diets study was a 3-arm, 12-wk randomly assigned intervention among African American (AA) adults at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus that tested the 3 USDG dietary patterns. The AAs (ages 18-65 y, BMI 25-49.9 kg/m, and BMI was measured in kg/m) with &#x2265;3 type 2 diabetes mellitus risk factors were recruited. Weight, HbA1c, blood pressure, and dietary quality (healthy eating index [HEI]) were collected at baseline and 12 wk. In addition, participants attended weekly online classes that were designed using material from the USDG/MyPlate. Repeated measures, mixed models with maximum likelihood estimation, and robust computation of standard errors were tested. Of the 227 participants screened, 63 were eligible (83% female; age 48.0 &#xb1; 10.6 y, BMI 35.9 &#xb1; 0.8 kg/m) and randomly assigned to the Healthy US-Style Eating Pattern (H-US) (n = 21, 81% completion), healthy Mediterranean-style eating pattern (Med) (n = 22, 86% completion), or healthy vegetarian eating pattern (Veg) (n = 20, 70% completion) groups. Within-group, but not between groups, weight loss was significant (-2.4 &#xb1; 0.7 kg H-US, -2.6 &#xb1; 0.7 kg Med, -2.4 &#xb1; 0.8 kg Veg; P = 0.97 between group). There was also no significant difference between groups for changes in HbA1c (0.03 &#xb1; 0.05% H-US, -0.10 &#xb1; 0.05% Med, 0.07 &#xb1; 0.06% Veg; P = 0.10), systolic BP (-5.5 &#xb1; 2.7 mmHg H-US, -3.2 &#xb1; 2.5 mmHg Med, -2.4 &#xb1; 2.9 mmHg Veg; P = 0.70), diastolic blood pressure (-5.2 &#xb1; 1.8 mmHg H-US, -2.0 &#xb1; 1.7 mmHg Med, -3.4 &#xb1; 1.9 mmHg Veg; P = 0.41), or HEI (7.1 &#xb1; 3.2 H-US, 15.2 &#xb1; 3.1 Med, 4.6 &#xb1; 3.4 Veg; P = 0.06). Post hoc analyses showed that the Med group had significantly greater improvements in HEI compared to the Veg group (difference = -10.6 &#xb1; 4.6; 95% CI: -19.7, -1.4; P = 0.02). The present study demonstrates that all 3 USDG dietary patterns lead to significant weight loss among AA adults. However, none of the outcomes were significantly different between groups. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04981847.
