Study Title: Effects of Dual-Task Group Training on Gait, Cognitive Executive Function, and Quality of Life in People With Parkinson Disease: Results of Randomized Controlled DUALGAIT Trial.

Study Summary:
The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of a dual-task group program, to compare it with the effects of a single-task group program, and to analyze the effects of functional secondary tasks. Single-blind randomized controlled trial. University laboratory and a rehabilitation gym at a health center. Patients (N=40) with a diagnosis of Parkinson disease (mean age, 66.72y; age range, 44-79y) with Hoehn and Yahr stage I to III who were on medication were randomized to either a group with dual-task training or a group with single-task training (only gait). Both interventions involved 20 sessions lasting 1 hour each and conducted twice a week. Dual-task training included walking exercises and cognitive or motor tasks carried out separately, then later performed together as a dual-task according to a progressive protocol in the same training session. Velocity and spatiotemporal parameters of gait were measured without a secondary task and during dual-task gait combined with a visual, verbal, auditory, and motor task. In addition, executive cognitive function and quality of life were measured. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postrehabilitation, and at the 8-week follow-up. The dual-task group demonstrated improved velocity and stride length time in all assessment conditions after training (P<.05), as well as perceived quality of life (P<.05). The single-task group experienced improvements in the same outcomes for only the motor condition (P<.05) after training, but failed to improve perceived quality of life (P>.05). Likewise, the dual-task group showed higher velocity and stride length after treatment than the single-task group across conditions. No significant changes were observed in cognitive performance (P>.05), although the dual-task group tended to improve performance during the executive function test. Dual-task training in functional contexts is associated with greater improvements in velocity and stride length in patients with PD compared with regular physiotherapy without secondary tasks. Dual-task training also improves perceived quality of life.
