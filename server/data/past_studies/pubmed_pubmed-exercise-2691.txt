Study Title: Effects of isolated shoulder versus core-shoulder chain exercises on motor control and isokinetic torque in baseball pitchers with shoulder impingement syndrome: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Recent biomechanical evidence suggests that shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is closely linked with altered core-shoulder kinetic chain, resulting pain, altered external shoulder muscle activation, and external muscle weakness. We aimed to compare the effects of conventional isolated shoulder exercise (ISE) and core-shoulder chain exercises (CCE) during isokinetic shoulder rotation in baseball pitchers with SIS. Forty male college baseball pitchers with SIS were randomly allocated to ISE and CCE groups and they performed the exercises 3 times a week for 6&#x2009;weeks. The standardised numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), electromyography (EMG) amplitude, and concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) torques were measured. Substantial improvements in NPRS and SPADI scores were observed after CCE compared to ISE (&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.046). Internal oblique/transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis, external oblique, serratus anterior, and infraspinatus muscle activation were significantly higher after CCE than ISE (&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.033). CON and ECC torques were higher after CCE than ISE (&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.002). The present findings demonstrated superior therapeutic effects of CCE in improving pain, disability level, shoulder muscle activation, and torque (muscle strength) in baseball pitchers with SIS compared to the conventional ISE, highlighting the importance of the chain exercise concept.
