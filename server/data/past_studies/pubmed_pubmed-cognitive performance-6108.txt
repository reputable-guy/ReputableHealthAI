Study Title: Concurrent training associated with moderate walnut consumption improved isokinetic strength, subjective sleep quality, cognitive performance and postural balance in elderly active men: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effects of concurrent training (resistance and endurance) associated with moderate walnut consumption on isokinetic strength, subjective sleep quality, cognitive performance and postural balance in physically active elderly men. Twenty healthy elderly men were divided into two matched groups, in a randomized controlled experiment. They have participated in three training sessions per week: concurrent (strength and endurance) training&#x2009;+&#x2009;ad libitum diet with walnuts (15&#xa0;g/day for 6 weeks, CTW: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10) and concurrent training&#x2009;+&#x2009;ad libitum diet (CT: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10). Isokinetic strength, Spiegel questionnaire, Montreal cognitive assessment and postural balance parameters were assessed 48&#xa0;h pre- and post-intervention. Absolute peak torque of knee extensors and knee flexors significantly increased compared to pre-training in CTW (15.2%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.7; 13.2%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.3, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05, respectively) and CT (10.6%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.8; 7.4%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.9, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05, respectively). Subjective sleep quality increased compared to pre-training for CTW and CT (24%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14.4; 10.5%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.4, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05, respectively) with a significantly greater increase in CTW (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Cognitive performance measured by Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)&#xa0;increased only in CTW compared to baseline (7.7%&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.5, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Postural balance parameters with dual task decreased only in CTW compared to baseline. The present study clearly revealed that concurrent training alone or associated with daily walnut (15 g) consumption for 6 weeks significantly increased knee isokinetic strength, support leg standing parameters and sleep quality. Meanwhile, cognitive performance evaluated by MoCA test and postural balance with dual task were improved for CTW group only.
