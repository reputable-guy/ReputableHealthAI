Study Title: Effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on recovery of gastrointestinal motility after laparotomy: A&#xa0;randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Postoperative Ileus (POI) negatively impacts patient outcomes and increases healthcare costs. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been found to improve gastrointestinal (GI) motility following abdominal surgery. However, its effectiveness in this context is not well-established. This study was designed to evaluate the role of TENS on the recovery of GI motility after exploratory laparotomy. Patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into control (standard treatment alone) and experimental (standard treatment&#xa0;+&#xa0;TENS) arms. TENS was terminated after 6&#xa0;days or after the passage of stool or stoma movement. The primary outcome was time for the first passage of stool/functioning stoma. Non-passage of stool or nonfunctioning stoma beyond 6&#xa0;days was labeled as prolonged POI. Patients were monitored until discharge. Median (interquartile range) time to first passage of stool/functioning stoma was 82.6 (49-115) hours in the standard treatment group and 50 (22-70.6) hours in the TENS group [p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001]. Prolonged POI was noted in 11 patients in the standard treatment group (35.5%) and one in the TENS group (3.2%) [p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003]. Postoperative hospital stay was similar in the two groups. TENS resulted in early recovery of GI motility by shortening the duration of POI without any improvement in postoperative hospital stay. CTRI/2021/10/037054.
