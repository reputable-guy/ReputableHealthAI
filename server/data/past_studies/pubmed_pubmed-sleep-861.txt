Study Title: Early sleep after action observation plus motor imagery improves gait and balance abilities in older adults.

Study Summary:
Action observation plus motor imagery (AOMI) is a rehabilitative approach to improve gait and balance performance. However, limited benefits have been reported in older adults. Early sleep after motor practice represents a strategy to enhance the consolidation of trained skills. Here, we investigated the effects of AOMI followed by early sleep on gait and balance performance in older adults. Forty-five older adults (mean age: 70.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.2&#xa0;years) were randomized into three groups performing a 3-week training. Specifically, AOMI-sleep and AOMI-control groups underwent observation and motor imagery of gait and balance tasks between 8:00 and 10:00 p.m. or between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. respectively, whereas Control group observed landscape video-clips. Participants were assessed for gait performance, static and dynamic balance and fear of falling before and after training and at 1-month follow-up. The results revealed that early sleep after AOMI training sessions improved gait and balance abilities in older adults compared to AOMI-control and Control groups. Furthermore, these benefits were retained at 1-month after the training end. These findings suggested that early sleep after AOMI may represent a safe and easy-applicable intervention to minimize the functional decay in older adults.
