Study Title: Comparison of the Effects of Ciprofol and Propofol on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Undergoing Outpatient Hysteroscopy.

Study Summary:
To evaluate and compare the effects of ciprofol and propofol on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy. Double-blind randomized controlled trial. This study included 1104 patients scheduled for elective outpatient hysteroscopy. Patients were randomly grouped to ciprofol Group (Group C, n = 539) and propofol Group (Group P, n = 547). Anesthesia was induced by sufentanil 0.1 ug/kg combined with ciprofol 0.3mg/kg or propofol 2.5mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained by ciprofol 1 to 1.5mg/kg/h or propofol 3 to 5mg/kg/h. The primary outcome of the study was PONV after surgery 1h and 24h. Secondary outcomes included heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), SpObefore anesthesia (T1), 3&#xa0;min after anesthesia (T2) and at the end of surgery (T3); the time of consciousness loss, recovery, hysteroscopy and discharge; and the incidence of adverse drug reactions such as hypotension, respiratory depression, bradycardia and injection pain was recorded in the two groups. Compared with group P, MAP and SpO2 at T2 were significantly increased in group C (<0.05). Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of PONV at 1h and 24h after surgery between 2 groups (> 0.05), the incidence of hypotension, injection pain and respiratory depression in group C were significantly reduced, compared with group P. (<0.05). Compared with propofol, ciprofol has a similar incidence of PONV and lower adverse effects such as hypotension, injection pain and respiratory depression in outpatient hysteroscopy.
