Study Title: Well-being fluctuations and injuries during an entire season in male professional soccer players: an observational study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to describe and relate the well-being perception and injury incidence of soccer players in an entire soccer season. For 37&#x2009;weeks, twenty-eight male professional soccer players (25.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.3&#x2009;years old; 22.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.4&#x2009;kg/m) daily scored (from 1: bad; to 5: perfect) well-being perception (fatigue, sleep, muscle soreness, stress and mood and Hooper Index (HI) as general status). Injuries were also registered. Results showed that players had the lowest well-being perception during Preseason (in terms of HI, fatigue, muscle soreness and stress), being lower than EarlySeason (p< 0.05, d> 1.0) and/or InSeason (p< 0.05, d> 1.0). The injury incidence was 8.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.2/1000&#x2009;h, being always higher in training compared to competition (35.0 vs 11.1/1000&#x2009;h). A lower stress perception (worse) correlated with a higher rate of new injuries during PreSeason (&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.84), while a greater muscle soreness and fatigue correlated with the new injuries occurring in the following week during the whole season (&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.38 and&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.39, respectively). As a conclusion, the well-being perception of professional soccer players was especially low during Preseason, with fatigue, muscle soreness and stress as the most affected items that correlated with injury incidence.
