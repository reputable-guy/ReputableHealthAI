Study Title: Preoperative Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet and Exclusive Enteral Nutrition in Adults with Crohn's Disease: A Feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Preoperative exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) improves nutritional status, reduces intestinal inflammation, and likely improves surgical outcomes. Crohn's disease exclusion diet with partial enteral nutrition (CDED) also reduces intestinal inflammation but its safety preoperatively is unknown. This single-blinded, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of three preoperative nutritional therapies aimed to assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining patients and collecting primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes. Adults undergoing elective Crohn's disease surgery with a body mass index (BMI) > 18.5 kg/mand without significant weight loss were eligible to participate. Patients were randomly assigned to six weeks of preoperative EEN, CDED, or standard care. Feasibility, nutritional, radiological, and surgical outcomes were recorded. Over 18 months, 48 patients were screened, 17 (35%) were randomised, and 13/17 (76%) patients were retained in the intervention phase. It was feasible to collect primary and secondary effectiveness data; at day 30, three patients had Clavien Dindo Grade 2 complications, and 10 had no complications. Nutritional therapy adherence of patients retained in the study was high. Recruitment and retention of patients who need elective Crohn's disease surgery for preoperative nutritional therapy is possible, although a shorter duration may improve EEN completion. The impact on surgical outcomes should be assessed in a larger study.
