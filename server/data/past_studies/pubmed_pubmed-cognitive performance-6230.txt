Study Title: Prefrontal oxygenation and working memory in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following integrated yoga: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) alters brain functional and structural connectivity leading to cognitive dysfunction. This study examined the effect of a 12-week yoga intervention on prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenation and working memory in patients with T2DM. Fifty participants were randomized into yoga and waitlist control groups. The yoga protocol specific to T2DM was followed. The pre- (day 1), mid- (6&#xa0;weeks) and post-intervention (12&#xa0;weeks) assessments included measurement of PFC oxygenation while performing working memory tasks (n-back) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Following a 12-week intervention, the yoga group showed improved performance in working memory [accuracy (geometric mean difference of 3.15%, 95% CI [2.33,3.96], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and reaction time (mean difference of 100.8 milliseconds,95% CI [-&#x2009;166.6, -&#x2009;35.1], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002] in the high task load (2-back) associated with higher oxygenation in dorsolateral PFC (&#x3b2; coefficient mean difference of 95.6, 95% CI [0.23,191], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049) and ventrolateral PFC (&#x3b2; coefficient mean difference of 53.4, 95% CI [7.8,98.9], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018) regions. Higher oxygenation in dorsolateral PFC during 2-back task was positively correlated with accuracy (r(23)&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.65, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and negatively correlated with reaction time (r(23)&#x2009;=&#x2009; -&#x2009;0.47,p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017). Integrated yoga practice may improve working memory performance associated with higher PFC oxygenation in patients with T2DM. As 12&#xa0;weeks of yoga intervention improved working memory performance, the regular practice of yoga may have the potential to prevent decline of cognitive functions in clinical conditions.
