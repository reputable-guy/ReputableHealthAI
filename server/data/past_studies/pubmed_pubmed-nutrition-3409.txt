Study Title: Teduglutide improves liver chemistries in short bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure: Post hoc analysis.

Study Summary:
Chronic hepatic complications are common in patients with short bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure (SBS-IF). Teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-2 analogue, demonstrated efficacy in reducing parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluid dependence among patients with SBS-IF in phase 3 clinical studies. This was a post hoc analysis of pooled data from two separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational phase 3 clinical studies. Adult patients with SBS-IF with parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluid dependence without liver disease at baseline were randomized to treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-2 analogue teduglutide (0.05 or 0.10&#x2009;mg/kg/day) or placebo subcutaneously once daily for 24 weeks. Mixed-effects models assessed the baseline predictors of change in liver chemistries. Between baseline and week 24, teduglutide treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;109) was associated with least squares mean reductions in aspartate aminotransferase (-7.51 IU/L; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014), alanine aminotransferase (-12.15&#x2009;IU/L; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and bilirubin (-5.03&#x2009;&#xb5;mol/L [-0.057&#x2009;mg/dl]; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) compared with that of the placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;59). These values were independent of reductions in parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluid dependence. Teduglutide treatment was associated with reductions in liver chemistries by week 24, which is beneficial for patients with SBS-IF beyond improvements in parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluid dependence. Future studies should examine how long-term teduglutide might mitigate the risk of liver disease in patients with SBS-IF.
