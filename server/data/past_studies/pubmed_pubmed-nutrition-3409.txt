Study Title: Perioperative nutrition management in patients with spinal tuberculosis taking ERAS measures.

Study Summary:
To explore the effect of nutrition management under ERAS concept in patients with spinal tuberculosis. The study was conducted in an orthopedic ward of a tertiary grade A special hospital in Beijing. The patients admitted from January 1, 2021 to June 27, 2023 were screened for inclusion. The qualified patients were randomized into experimental group or control group. The experimental group received perioperative nutrition management under the concept of ERAS while the control group received routine perioperative management in hospital. The data was collected on the next day of admission, the next day and the sixth day after operation, including laboratory indicators (lymphocyte count, hemoglobin level, etc), intraoperative bleeding volume, postoperative exhaust, defecation time, drainage volume, albumin infusion amount, nutritional risk score, length of stay, hospitalization costs, etc. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis correcting for gender, age, and baseline values were performed using SPSS24.0. A total of 127 patients with spinal tuberculosis completed the study. Compared with the control group, the intraoperative blood loss (p=0.028) in the experimental group was significantly reduced, the postoperative exhaust time (p=0.012) and defecation time (p=0.012) were significantly shortened, and the nutritional status (p<0.001) was significantly improved. Besides, the results of multivariate analysis are robust after correcting potential confounding factors. Nutrition management under the concept of ERAS is helpful to reduce intraoperative bleeding, promote postoperative flatus and defecation, and improve nutritional status in patients with spinal tuberculosis, which may further improve their clinical outcome and prognosis.
