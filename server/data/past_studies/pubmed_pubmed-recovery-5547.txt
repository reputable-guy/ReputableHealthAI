Study Title: Identifying the Mechanisms of a Peripherally Limited Exercise Phenotype in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.

Study Summary:
We identified peripherally limited patients using cardiopulmonary exercise testing and measured skeletal muscle oxygen transport and utilization during invasive single leg exercise testing to identify the mechanisms of the peripheral limitation. Forty-five patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (70&#xb1;7 years, 27 females) completed seated upright cardiopulmonary exercise testing and were defined as having a (1) peripheral limitation to exercise if cardiac output/oxygen consumption (VO) was elevated (&#x2265;6) or 5 to 6 with a stroke volume reserve >50% (n=31) or (2) a central limitation to exercise if cardiac output/VOslope was &#x2264;5 or 5 to 6 with stroke volume reserve <50% (n=14). Single leg knee extension exercise was used to quantify peak leg blood flow (Doppler ultrasound), arterial-to-venous oxygen content difference (femoral venous catheter), leg VO, and muscle oxygen diffusive conductance. In a subset of participants (n=36), phosphocreatine recovery time was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Peak VOduring cardiopulmonary exercise testing was not different between groups (central: 13.9&#xb1;5.7 versus peripheral: 12.0&#xb1;3.1 mL/min per kg;=0.135); however, the peripheral group had a lower peak arterial-to-venous oxygen content difference (central: 13.5&#xb1;2.0 versus peripheral: 11.1&#xb1;1.6 mLO/dL blood;<0.001). During single leg knee extension, there was no difference in peak leg VO(=0.306), but the peripherally limited group had greater blood flow/VOratio (=0.024), lower arterial-to-venous oxygen content difference (central: 12.3&#xb1;2.5 versus peripheral: 10.3&#xb1;2.2 mLO/dL blood;=0.013), and lower muscle oxygen diffusive conductance (=0.021). A difference in magnetic resonance spectroscopy-derived phosphocreatine recovery time was not detected (=0.199). Peripherally limited patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction identified by cardiopulmonary exercise testing have impairments in oxygen transport and utilization at the level of the skeletal muscle quantified by invasive knee extension exercise testing, which includes an increased blood flow/V&#x307;Oratio and poor muscle diffusive capacity.
