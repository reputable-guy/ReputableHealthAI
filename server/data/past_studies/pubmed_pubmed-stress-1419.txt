Study Title: Effect of kangaroo mother care and white noise on physiological-stress parameters in heel lancing: randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Newborns are exposed to varying degrees of stressful interventions due to procedures such as heel lancing used in routine metabolic screenings. It is an examination of the effects of white noise and kangaroo care on some physiological parameters and stress markers (cortisol and glucose-regulated protein 78-GRP78) in heel lancing in newborns. Randomized controlled study was conducted at a gynecology service of a hospital between January and September 2023. 90 babies were divided into three groups: 30 babies in the Kangaroo Care Group (KCG), 30 babies in the White Music Group (WMG), and 30 babies in the Control Group (CG). All babies were randomly divided into groups. Stress parameters were measured by saliva collection method and physiological parameters by saturation device. A statistically significant difference was determined between the total crying time, pulse and saturation values &#x200b;&#x200b;according to the groups (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). A statistically significant difference was determined between the mean values &#x200b;&#x200b;of cortisol and GRP78 measurements according to group and time interaction (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). KCG was more effective in reducing total crying time and stabilizing pulse, saturation, salivary cortisol, GRP-78 values compared to WNG and CG. It was concluded that white noise and kangaroo care help reduce newborns' stress in the case of heel lancing. The practice of kangaroo care and the use of white noise methods may assist healthcare professionals as supportive methods in stress management during invasive procedures.
