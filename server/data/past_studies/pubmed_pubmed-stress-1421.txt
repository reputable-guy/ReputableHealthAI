Study Title: Probiotics and magnesium orotate for the treatment of major depressive disorder: a randomised double blind controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Following on from our pilot studies, this study aimed to test the efficacy of a combination of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus), magnesium orotate and coenzyme 10 for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) through a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. The participants were 120 adults diagnosed with MDD randomised to daily oral administration, over 8&#xa0;weeks, of either the intervention or placebo, with a 16-week follow-up period. Intent-to-treat analysis found a significantly lower frequency of the presence of a major depressive episode in the intervention group compared with placebo at the end of the 8-week treatment phase, with no difference between the two conditions at 8-week follow-up. Both the categorical and continuous measure of depressive symptoms showed a significant difference between the two conditions at 4&#xa0;weeks, but not 8 and 16&#xa0;weeks. The secondary end-point was demonstrated with an overall reduction in self-rated symptoms of anxiety and stress in the active treatment group compared with placebo. These findings suggest that the combination of probiotics, magnesium orotate and coenzyme 10 may be an effective treatment of MDD over an 8-week period.
