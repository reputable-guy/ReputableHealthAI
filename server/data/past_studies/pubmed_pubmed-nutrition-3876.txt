Study Title: Who benefits most from a prenatal HEPA filter air cleaner intervention on childhood cognitive development? The UGAAR randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Air pollution exposure during pregnancy affects children's brain function. Maternal stress and nutrition, socioeconomic status, and the child's sex may modify this relationship. To identify characteristics of children with the largest increases in full-scale IQ (FSIQ) after their mothers used HEPA filter air cleaners during pregnancy. In this randomized controlled trial we randomly assigned women to receive 1-2 air cleaners or no air cleaners during pregnancy. We analyzed maternal hair samples for cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). When the children were 48 months old, we measured FSIQ with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. We evaluated ten potential modifiers of the intervention-FSIQ relationship using interaction terms in separate regression models. To account for correlations between modifiers, we also used a single regression model containing main effects and intervention x modifier terms for all potential modifiers. Among 242 mother-child dyads with complete data, the intervention was associated with a 2.3-point increase (95% CI: -1.5, 6.0 points) in mean FSIQ. The intervention improved mean FSIQ among children of mothers in the bottom (5.4 points; 95% CI: -0.8, 11.5) and top (6.1 points; 95% CI: 0.5, 11.8) cortisol tertiles, but not among those whose mothers were in the middle tertile. The largest between-group difference in the intervention's effect was a 7.5-point (95% CI: -0.7, 15.7) larger increase in mean FSIQ among children whose mothers did not take vitamins than among children whose mothers did take vitamins (interaction p-value&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.07). We also observed larger benefits among children whose mothers did not complete university, and those with lower hair DHEA concentrations, hair cortisol concentrations outside the middle tertile, or more perceived stress. The benefits of reducing air pollution during pregnancy on brain development may be greatest for children whose mothers who do not take vitamins, experience more stress, or have less education.
