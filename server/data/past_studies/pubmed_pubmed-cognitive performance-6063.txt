Study Title: Cognitive enhancing effect of rTMS combined with tDCS in patients with major depressive disorder: a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study.

Study Summary:
Cognitive dysfunction is one of the common symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been studied separately in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD patients. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of rTMS combined with tDCS as a new therapy to improve neurocognitive impairment in MDD patients. In this brief 2-week, double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled trial, a total of 550 patients were screened, and 240 MDD inpatients were randomized into four groups (active rTMS&#x2009;+&#x2009;active tDCS, active rTMS&#x2009;+&#x2009;sham tDCS, sham rTMS&#x2009;+&#x2009;active tDCS, sham rTMS&#x2009;+&#x2009;sham tDCS). Finally, 203 patients completed the study and received 10 treatment sessions over a 2-week period. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was performed to assess patients' cognitive function at baseline and week 2. Also, we applied the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-24) to assess patients' depressive symptoms at baseline and week 2. After 10 sessions of treatment, the rTMS combined with the tDCS group showed more significant improvements in the RBANS total score, immediate memory, and visuospatial/constructional index score (all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Moreover, post hoc tests revealed a significant increase in the RBANS total score and Visuospatial/Constructional in the combined treatment group compared to the other three groups but in the immediate memory, the combined treatment group only showed a better improvement than the sham group. The results also showed the RBANS total score increased significantly higher in the active rTMS group compared with the sham group. However, rTMS or tDCS alone was not superior to the sham group in terms of other cognitive performance. In addition, the rTMS combined with the tDCS group showed a greater reduction in HDRS-24 total score and a better depression response rate than the other three groups. rTMS combined with tDCS treatment is more effective than any single intervention in treating cognitive dysfunction and depressive symptoms in MDD patients.
