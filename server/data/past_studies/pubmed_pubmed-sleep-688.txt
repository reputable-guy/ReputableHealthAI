Study Title: Sleep Quality in High-Risk Pregnancies: Mixed Methods Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Mindfulness Training Intervention.

Study Summary:
Sleep difficulties in pregnancy are common and increase the risk for obstetric complications. Past research shows that mindfulness training (MT) is helpful for improving sleep in non-pregnant adults and may improve sleep during pregnancy. However, it is unknown if MT improves sleep among pregnant people at risk for obstetric complications. We examined the effects of MT on sleep quality in individuals at risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Twenty-nine participants (mean age, 32 &#xb1; 4 years; mean gestational age, 16 &#xb1; 3weeks) at risk for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) were randomized to an 8-week phone-delivered MT intervention (n = 15) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 14), designed to test MT feasibility and acceptability. As part of the study, participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and participated in a semi-structured individual qualitative interview which queried for sleep changes over pregnancy.Participants randomized to MT reported less daytime sleep dysfunction compared to TAU (F = 5.79,= 0.03, &#x3b7;= 0.28). Qualitative data illustrated the common experiences of sleep disturbance across both study groups; however, MT participants reported an improved ability to initiate sleep and return to sleep using mindfulness skills. About half of the participants in the MT condition reported an improvement in overall sleep quality due to less interference related to anxiety and restlessness, while other MT participants reported no change in sleep quality.Results from this study confirm that pregnant individuals frequently encounter sleep challenges. Findings also suggest that MT may be a helpful tool in improving sleep quality among pregnant people at risk for obstetric complications.
