Study Title: Positive effect of deep diaphragmatic breathing training on gastroesophageal reflux-induced chronic cough: a clinical randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
To explore the efficacy of deep diaphragmatic breathing training (DEP) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux-induced chronic cough (GERC). A randomized controlled study was conducted involving 60 GERC patients who were divided into the intervention group and the control group (each with 30 patients). Both groups received routine medication treatment for GERC, while the intervention group received DEP training additionally. Both groups were evaluated by cough symptom scores, Hull airway reflux questionnaire (HARQ), gastroesophageal reflux diagnostic questionnaire (GerdQ), generalized anxiety disorder scale-7 (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the Leicester cough questionnaire (LCQ), as well as capsaicin cough sensitivity testing, B-ultrasound and surface electromyography (sEMG) of the diaphragmatic muscles before and after treatment. The cough resolution rate and changes of the above indictors was compared between the two groups after eight weeks of treatment. After eight weeks of treatment, cough symptoms improved in both groups, but the cough resolution rate in the intervention group of 94% was significantly higher than that in the control group of 77% (&#x3c7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.402, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041). The intervention group showed significant improvements to the control group in GerdQ (6.13(0.35) VS 6.57(0.77)), GAD-7 (0(0;1) VS 1(0;3)), PSQI (2(1;3) VS 4(3;6)), LCQ (17.19(1.56) VS 15.88(1.92)) and PHQ-9 (0(0;0) VS 0(0;3)) after treatment. Compared to control group, sEMG activity of the diaphragmatic muscle was significantly increased in the intervention group after treatment, measured during DEP (79.00(2.49) VS 74.65 (1.93)) and quiet breathing (72.73 (1.96) VS 67.15 (2.48)). DEP training can improve cough symptoms as an adjunctive treatment in GERC patients. The protocol was registered in February 2, 2022 via the Chinese Clinical Trials Register ( http://www.chictr.org.cn/ ) [ChiCTR2200056246].
