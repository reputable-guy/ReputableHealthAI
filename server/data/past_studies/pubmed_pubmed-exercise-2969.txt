Study Title: Effects of Milk Fat Globule Membrane Supplementation Following Exercise Training on Physical Performance in Healthy Young Adults: A Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Trial.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to examine whether 4 wk of daily ingestion of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) combined with exercise training improves physical performance-muscle strength, agility and muscle power-in healthy young adults. The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial. Twenty healthy young adults received either an MFGM powder containing 1.6 g of fat and 160 mg of sphingomyelin or an isocaloric placebo powder daily throughout 4 wk of power or agility training. Physical performance tests and body composition measurements were conducted before and after the 4-wk intervention. Ingestion of MFGM did not affect isometric or isokinetic muscle strength, but it was associated with a greater increase in vertical jump peak power compared with placebo. There were no significant changes in body weight or lean body mass during the intervention period in either group, and no significant differences between groups. We conclude that daily MFGM supplementation combined with exercise training has the potential to improve physical performance in young adults; however, further studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to obtain more evidence supporting achievement of improved physical performance through MFGM supplementation.
