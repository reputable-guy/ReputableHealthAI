Study Title: The effect of pregnancy pilates-assisted childbirth preparation training on urinary incontinence and birth outcomes: a randomized-controlled study.

Study Summary:
To examine the effect of pregnancy pilates-assisted birth preparation training on urinary incontinence (UI) including stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) during pregnancy, and the postpartum period and birth outcomes. In this single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled study, 126 participants who have 28-30&#xa0;weeks of gestation and nulliparous were randomly assigned to receive either the (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;63) or control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;63). The study was carried out between March and August 2022. Pregnancy pilates intervention was applied twice in a week, a total of 8 weeks to pilates group. The control group was given routine obstetric and pregnancy care. A personal data form and the Michigan Incontinence Severity Index Form (M-ISI) were used as data collection tools. The mean weight gains of the experimental group during pregnancy were significantly lower than the control group. The experimental group had almost twice the rate of vaginal birth than those of the control group. The duration of labor mean score of experimental group was 5 h and 43&#xa0;min less than the duration of labor of the control group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). After intervention, and postpartum period, the SUI and UUI severity of the experimental group was significantly lower than those of the control group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Pilates-assisted childbirth preparation training reduced the severity of UI including SUI and UUI symptoms during pregnancy and the early postpartum. In addition, pilates-assisted childbirth preparation training contributes to decrease in weight gain during pregnancy, the increase in the vaginal birth rate, and the shortening of the duration of labor.
