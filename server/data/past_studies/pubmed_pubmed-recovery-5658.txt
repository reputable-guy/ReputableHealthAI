Study Title: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation improves anxiety symptoms and cortical activity during verbal fluency task in Parkinson's disease with anxiety.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of 20/4Hz transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on anxiety symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the potential neural mechanism. In the current randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, 30 PD patients with anxiety (PD-A), 30 PD patients without anxiety (PD-nA), and 30 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. PD-A patients were randomly (1:1) allotted to real taVNS stimulation group (RS) or sham stimulation group (SS) to explore the efficacy of a two-week treatment of taVNS to promote anxiety recovery. Simultaneously, all participants were measured activation in the bilateral prefrontal cortex during verbal fluency task (VFT) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. PD-A patients showed significantly decreased oxyhemoglobin in the left triangle part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during VFT, which was negatively related to the severity of anxiety symptoms. After two-week treatment of taVNS, the interaction of group and time had significant effect on HAMA scores (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;18.476, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001, &#x3b7;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.398). In RS group, compared with baseline, HAMA scores decreased significantly in the post-treatment and follow-up condition (both p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Meanwhile, in RS group, HAMA scores were lower than those in SS group in the post-treatment and follow-up condition (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006, <0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the 20/4Hz taVNS remarkably ameliorated anxiety symptoms in PD patients, directly correlated with the increased activation of the left triangle part of the IFG during VFT in RS group. Our results depicted that taVNS could ameliorate the anxiety symptoms of PD-A patients and regulated the function of the left triangle part of the IFG.
