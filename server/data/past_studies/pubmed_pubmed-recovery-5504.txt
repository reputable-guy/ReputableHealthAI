Study Title: Superiority of opioid free anesthesia with regional block over opioid anesthesia with regional block in the quality of recovery after retroperitoneiscopic renal surgery: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Opioids are the main analgesic drugs used in the perioperative period, but they often have various adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that quadratus lumborum block (QLB) has an opioid sparing effect. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the effect of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) combined with regional block on the quality of recovery in patients undergoing retroperitoneoscopic renal surgery. Sixty patients undergoing elective retroperitoneoscopic renal surgery were divided into the opioid-free anesthesia with quadratus lumborum block group (OFA group, N.=30) and opioid anesthesia with quadratus lumborum block group (OA group, N.=30) using the random number table method. The main outcome measures were the quality of recovery assessed by Quality of Recover-40 (QoR-40) at the 24postoperative hour. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain score, postoperative opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting, time to ambulate, and time to readiness for discharge. The QoR-40 score on the first postoperative day was significantly higher in the OFA group than that in the OA group (175.41&#xb1;6.74 vs. 165.07&#xb1;4.55; P<0.05). OFA also significantly reduced postoperative pain (P<0.05) and morphine consumption at both the 24th and 48th postoperative hour (P<0.05), as well as time to ambulate, and time to readiness for discharge (P<0.05). OFA with regional block is superior to opioid anesthesia with regional block in the quality of recovery after retroperitoneiscopic renal surgery.
