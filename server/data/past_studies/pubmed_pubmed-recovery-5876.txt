Study Title: A Study on the Effects of Esketamine Combined with Comprehensive Nursing Intervention on Postoperative Pain, Postpartum Depression, and Quality of Life in Women Undergoing Cesarean Section.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to investigate and analyze the effects of esketamine combined with comprehensive nursing intervention on postoperative pain, postpartum depression, and quality of life in women undergoing cesarean section. This study included 140 parturients who underwent cesarean section in The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University (from May 2021 to May 2022). The participants were divided into two groups: the control group and the study group, based on random allocation. The control group received traditional treatment and routine nursing care, while the study group received esketamine combined with comprehensive nursing intervention. Postoperative pain, postpartum depression, and quality of life were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and SF-36 questionnaire, respectively. The two groups had no significant differences in baseline data (P > .05). The postoperative VAS scores of the study group (1.86 &#xb1; 0.65) were lower than those of the control group (3.04 &#xb1; 0.79) (P < .05). The postoperative EPDS scores of the study group (5.23 &#xb1; 1.07) were lower than those of the control group (8.11 &#xb1; 1.84) (P < .05). The postoperative physiological recovery of the study group was superior to that of the control group (P < .05). The postoperative SF-36 scores of the study group were higher than those of the control group (P < .05). The combined use of esketamine and comprehensive nursing in cesarean sections offers practical benefits for patient care. Notably, it leads to reduced postoperative pain, as indicated by lower VAS scores, promising improved satisfaction for parturients. The intervention also demonstrates a positive impact on postpartum mental health, with lower EPDS scores suggesting potential benefits in alleviating depression. Moreover, the observed accelerated physiological recovery in the study group, along with shorter hospital stays, signifies efficiency gains in healthcare delivery. This not only optimizes resource utilization but also contributes to an enhanced overall recovery experience for women undergoing cesarean sections. The application of esketamine combined with comprehensive nursing intervention after cesarean section has a positive impact on the pain relief, postpartum depression, and quality of life of parturients. This study provides new insights and guidance for clinical practice, potentially enhancing the postoperative experience of women undergoing cesarean section. These findings furnish healthcare professionals with valuable insights and guidance, fostering a nuanced and improved standard of care in obstetric practices.
