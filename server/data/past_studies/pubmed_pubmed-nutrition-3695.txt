Study Title: The Effects of Nitrate Supplementation on Performance as a Function of Habitual Dietary Intake of Nitrates: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Elite Football Players.

Study Summary:
Nitrates are an effective ergogenic supplement; however, the effects of nitrate supplements based on habitual dietary nitrate intake through diet alone are not well understood. We aimed to assess this in a group of 15 highly trained football players from Slovenian football's First Division. Participants underwent two separate Cooper performance tests either with nitrate supplementation (400 mg nitrates) or placebo while having their nutrition assessed for nitrate intake, as well as energy and macronutrient intake. Nitrate supplementation had a statistically significant positive effect on performance if baseline dietary nitrate intake was below 300 mg (= 0.0104) in both the placebo and intervention groups. No effects of nitrate supplementation when baseline dietary nitrate intake was higher than 300 mg in the placebo group could be concluded due to the small sample size. Nitrate supplementation did not have a significant effect on perceived exertion. The daily nitrate intake of the participants was measured at 165 mg, with the majority of nitrates coming from nitrate-rich vegetables.
