The energy expenditure associated with body-weight resistance exercises of various movement patterns performed at different durations. J Strength Cond Res 38(12): 2034-2046, 2024-Although body-weight resistance exercises (BWRE) are popular and effective for body mass reduction and neuromuscular performance, limited information exists regarding their total energy expenditure (TEE). This study determined the energy cost associated with seven BWRE of different movement patterns plank, push-ups, squat, single-leg squat [SLS], forward lunge [FL], burpees, and jumping jacks [JJ] using 2 different durations (T30: 30-second; T45: 45-second) in 10 healthy young adults using a randomized, 2-trial, crossover, repeated-measures design. The level of significance was set at p &#x2264; 0.05. The burpees were associated with the highest and the plank with the lowest intensity (rates of perceived exertion [RPE] and mean heart rate [MHR]) and metabolic load (blood lactate [BL] accumulation, metabolic equivalents of task [METs], and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption [EPOC]) in both trials. In T30 and T45, TEE (kcals per minute) was 11.3/12.6 in plank, 18.6/22.0 in FL, 19.8/21.2 in SLS, 19.9/23.2 in squat, 22.0/24.9 in push-ups, 23.1/22.8 in JJ, and 32.2/40.7 in burpees. Although RPE, MHR, BL, and EPOC were comparable among T30 and T45, METs and TEE were greater in T45. These results suggest that TEE of BWRE ranges from &#x223c;11 to 40 kcals&#xb7;min -1 , depending on the movement pattern and the duration of exercise. This information may be valuable for those using BWRE for body-weight management and improvement of strength performance.
