Study Title: Skin Rejuvenation Efficacy and Safety Evaluation ofStandardized Extract (BG100) in Human 3D Skin Models and Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Polymethoxyflavones fromrhizomes have been shown to effectively combat aging in skin cells and tissues by inhibiting senescence, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing skin structure and function. This study assessed the anti-aging effects and safety of standardizedextract (BG100), enriched with polymethoxyflavones including 5,7-dimethoxyflavone, 5,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone, 3,5,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone, 3,5,7-trimethoxyflavone, and 3,5,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone. We evaluated BG100's impact on skin rejuvenation and antioxidant properties using photoaged human 3D full-thickness skin models. The potential for skin irritation and sensitization was also assessed through studies on reconstructed human epidermis and clinical trials. Additionally, in vitro genotoxicity testing was performed following OECD guidelines. Results indicate that BG100 promotes collagen and hyaluronic acid production, reduces oxidative stress, and minimizes DNA damage in photoaged full-thickness 3D skin models. Furthermore, it exhibited non-irritating and non-sensitizing properties, as supported by tests on reconstructed human epidermis and clinical settings. BG100 also passed in vitro genotoxicity tests, adhering to OECD guidelines. These results underscore BG100's potential as a highly effective and safe, natural anti-aging agent, suitable for inclusion in cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products aimed at promoting skin rejuvenation.
