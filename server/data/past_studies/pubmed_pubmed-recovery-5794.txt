Study Title: Improvement of Post-Surgery Constipation in Patients with Fractures byJYLR-127: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The high prevalence of constipation after fracture surgery brings intolerable discomfort to patients on the one hand, and affects post-surgery nutrient absorption on the other hand, resulting in poor prognosis. Given the acknowledged probiotic properties of, 100 fracture patients with post-surgery constipation were centrally enrolled and administered orally withJYLR-127 to assess the efficacy of probiotic-adjuvant therapy in alleviating post-fracture constipation symptoms. The results showed thatJYLR-127 improved fecal properties, promoted gastrointestinal recovery, and relieved constipation symptoms, which were mainly achieved by elevating Firmicutes (< 0.01) and descending Bacteroidetes (< 0.001), hence remodeling the disrupted intestinal microecology. In addition, blood routine presented a decrease in C-reactive protein levels (< 0.05) and an increase in platelet counts (< 0.05) after probiotic supplementation, prompting the feasibility ofJYLR-127 in anti-inflammation, anti-infection and hemorrhagic tendency prevention after fracture surgery. Our study to apply probiotics in ameliorating constipation after fracture surgery is expected to bless the bothered patients, and provide broader application scenarios forpreparations.
