Study Title: Virtual reality exposure reduce acute postoperative pain in female patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecology surgery: A Randomized Control Trial (RCT) study.

Study Summary:
Few studies have focused on the effect of virtual reality (VR) exposure on postoperative acute pain in adult female patients undergoing gynecology surgery. A randomized control trial (RCT) study. At Beijing Fuxing Hospital. 115 patients aged between 20 and 60&#xa0;years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I - II were consecutively enrolled and randomly divided into VR group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;58) or control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;57). Patients in the VR group received 15&#xa0;min of VR video viewing before surgery. The primary outcome was acute postoperative pain at 8&#xa0;h which was measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores. The secondary outcomes including the use of analgesic drugs, the incidence of moderate pain and postoperative recovery which were recorded 24&#xa0;h after surgery. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was also used to evaluate patients' emotional status before surgery. The VAS scores at 30&#xa0;min [2 (1,2) vs. 3 (2,3)], 2&#xa0;h [2 (2,3) vs. 4 (3,4)], 4&#xa0;h [3 (2,4) vs. 4 (4,5)], 8&#xa0;h [3 (2,4) vs. 4 (4,5)], 12&#xa0;h [2 (2,3) vs. 4 (3,4)], 24&#xa0;h [1 (1,2) vs. 3 (2,3)] after surgery. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) indicated that VR intervention was negatively correlated with postoperative VAS values (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.830, S.E&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.199, 95%CI (-1.220,-0.439), Wald &#x3c7;&#xa0;=&#xa0;17.359, p<0.05), in the meanwhile, VR also lower the incidence of moderate pain (VAS&#xa0;>&#xa0;4) at 8&#xa0;h postoperatively (12.1% vs 31.0%, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013). However, the 24&#xa0;h tramadol usage remained unchanged. Patients in the VR group had better sleep quality (6.33&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.3 vs. 4.12&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.5, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and lower incidence of nausea (43.1% vs. 63.2%, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), dizziness (0% vs. 14.0%, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), and headache (12.1% vs. 29.8%, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). VR could reduce the median HADS scores (9.81&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.1 vs 3.14&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.9, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and blood pressure preoperatively. VR intervention can reduce acute postoperative pain with better postoperative recovery and lower preoperative anxiety level in adult female patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecology surgery.
