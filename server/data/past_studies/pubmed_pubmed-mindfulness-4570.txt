Study Title: Effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction on depression, anxiety, and stress of women with the early loss of pregnancy in southeast Iran: a randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
The loss of the fetus may cause mental health problems in women. The present study aimed to determine the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on anxiety, depression, and stress in women with early pregnancy loss. &#xa0;This study was performed on 106 women with early pregnancy loss in Shiraz, Iran. The intervention group underwent eight counselling sessions. Pre-test and post-test were performed in both groups with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) 21 questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS 23. &#xa0;There was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores in the intervention group vs. the control group in terms of anxiety (7.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.07 vs. 13.79&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.36, respectively), stress (9.26&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.25 vs.18.13&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.66, respectively), and depression (7.83&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.05 vs.16.26&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.06, respectively) (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001). MBSR can be suggested to promote women's mental health.
