Study Title: Compound electrolyte intraocular irrigating solution produces better effects on vision recovery of cataract patients after surgery than Ringer lactate solution.

Study Summary:
Intraocular irrigating solution is extensively applied in cataract surgery. This paper explored the difference and relationship between optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical quality analysis system (OQAS) parameters induced by compound electrolyte intraocular irrigating solution (CEIIS) or Ringer lactate (RL) solution during uncomplicated cataract surgery. Totally 200 senior cataract patients were randomly divided into the CEIIS and RL groups (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;100 patients/group). The anterior chamber was irrigated by CEIIS or RL during phacoemulsification. Patients were subdivided into diabetes mellitus (DM)+&#x2009;and DM- groups. The central macular thickness (CMT), hyper reflective foci (HF), modulation transfer function cutoff frequency (MTF cutoff), Strehl ratio (SR), objective scatter index (OSI), and OQAS values (OVs) at 100%, 20%, and 9% contrast levels were measured preoperatively and 1&#xa0;day and 1&#xa0;week after operation using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and OQAS II, respectively. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed using the Snellen scale, followed by statistical analysis of its logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the CEIIS and RL groups. Both groups exhibited notably increased postoperative CMT, MTF cutoff, SR, OV at 100%, 20%, and 9% contrast levels, and reduced OSI, indicating CEIIS and RL improved postoperative visual quality. CEIIS surpassed RL solution in improving postoperative visual quality, decelerating the increase of macular HF numbers and CMT in DM+&#x2009;patients and postoperative BCVA. There was no difference between CEIIS and RL in long-term vision improvement. CEIIS surpasses RL in postoperative visual recovery and retards increases of macular HF numbers and CMT in senior DM+&#x2009;cataract patients.
