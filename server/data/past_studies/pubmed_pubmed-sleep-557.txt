Study Title: An exploration into the relationship between insomnia and repetitive negative thinking among cancer survivors.

Study Summary:
Insomnia and repetitive negative thinking (RNT) are both prevalent among cancer survivors, yet little work has investigated their interrelationship. To explore the hypothesis that RNT and insomnia are related, we conducted secondary analyses on data from a pilot clinical trial of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for cancer survivors. This study analyzed survey data from 40 cancer survivors with insomnia who participated in a pilot randomized trial of CBT-I. Correlations and linear regression models were used to determine associations between aspects of RNT and related constructs (fear of cancer recurrence [FCR], cancer-specific rumination, worry, and intolerance of uncertainty) and sleep (insomnia and sleep quality), while accounting for psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Treatment-related change in RNT was examined using a series of linear mixed models. Evidence for an association between RNT and insomnia among cancer survivors emerged. Higher levels of FCR and cancer-related rumination were correlated with more severe insomnia symptoms and worse sleep quality. Notably, FCR levels predicted insomnia, even after controlling for anxiety and depression. Results identified potential benefits and limitations of CBT-I in addressing RNT that should be examined more thoroughly in future research. RNT is a potential target to consider in insomnia treatment for cancer survivors.
