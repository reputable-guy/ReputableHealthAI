Study Title: Impact of mindfulness training on emotion regulation in multiple sclerosis: Secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Purpose/Objective Research: This secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) aimed to compare mindfulness-based training (MBT), adaptive cognitive training (aCT), and a waitlist control (WL) on the use of emotion regulation strategies during daily worries and ruminations. Further, we examined cognitive functioning as a moderator of training effects. Sixty-one PwMS were randomized into an MBT, aCT, or a WL control group for four weeks. Participants completed daily diaries assessing their use of emotion regulation strategies and measures of cognitive functioning at pre- and posttraining. The frequency of acceptance use, maladaptive strategies, and cognitive reappraisal, as well as the success of acceptance use, were the primary outcomes of interest. We also examined whether a cognitive composite score moderated treatment gains. Relative to pretraining, at posttraining, participants in the MBT group used acceptance more frequently, and this change was significantly greater compared to the change in aCT and WL groups. Training did not have differential effects on the frequency of maladaptive strategy and cognitive reappraisal use or on the success of acceptance use. Cognitive functioning did not moderate observed treatment gains. Our findings, based on this pilot study, suggest that after brief training in mindfulness meditation, PwMS used more acceptance strategies to regulate their emotions. Future studies with larger sample sizes, longer duration of treatment, and longitudinal follow-up are needed to better understand the efficacy of mindfulness mediation for promoting affective and cognitive health in PwMS.
