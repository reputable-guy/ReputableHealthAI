Study Title: Fitness and psychological effects of tele-exercise in healthy populations. Preliminary study.

Study Summary:
The study investigates the impact of tele-exercise on physical fitness and psychological well-being in healthy individuals. Tele-exercise, facilitated by technology, offers a flexible and accessible alternative to traditional exercise, particularly beneficial during restricted in-person interactions. In this study, 52 participants were divided into three groups: athletes, women, and young adults. They took part in an eight-week tele-exercise program, either synchronously or asynchronously. Physical fitness was evaluated using tests such as the 2-Minute Step and Curl Up Test, while psychological well-being was assessed using the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Significant improvements in physical fitness and psychological well-being were observed in post-intervention across all groups, regardless of training mode. In the fitness tests, a significant improvement was obtained in the 2-Minute-Step (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), in the curls up (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017), and in squats test (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). In the forward bending test, the increment was very close to the significance (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.051). In the psychological well-being tests, both PGWBI and WHO-5 scores increased after the training (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024 and&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 respectively) with no significant change in the PSS-10 score. The study found that tele-exercise can effectively introduce physical activity to previously inactive individuals and motivate them to adopt healthier lifestyle behaviors. The TELEexe4ALL project demonstrates the potential of tele-exercise to improve physical fitness and psychological well-being. The study suggests that tele-exercise is a feasible and well-accepted approach for enhancing overall wellness in healthy populations.
