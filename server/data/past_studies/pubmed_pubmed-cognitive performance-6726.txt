Study Title: Effects of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function and blood A&#x3b2;-related biomarkers in older adults with Alzheimer's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Our study aimed to assess the effect of a 12-month vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function and amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;)-related biomarkers in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS&#xa0;: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 210 AD patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Participants received 12-month 800&#x2009;IU/day of vitamin D or starch granules as placebo. Tests of cognitive performance and A&#x3b2;-related biomarkers were measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. RESULTS&#xa0;: Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant improvements in plasma A&#x3b2;42, APP, BACE1, APPmRNA, BACE1mRNA (p<0.001) levels and information, arithmetic, digit span, vocabulary, block design and picture arrange scores (p<0.05) in the intervention group over the control group. According to mixed-model analysis, vitamin D group had significant increase in full scale IQ during follow-up period (p<0.001). Daily oral vitamin D supplementation (800&#x2009;IU/day) for 12 months may improve cognitive function and decrease A&#x3b2;-related biomarkers in elderly patients with AD. Larger scale longer term randomised trials of vitamin D are needed. ChiCTR-IIR-16009549.
