Study Title: Well-being factors associated with confidence in providing calm, compassionate care in pediatric residents.

Study Summary:
Engagement in calm, compassionate care (CCC) is important in fostering patient-centered care. We aimed to study factors which predict confidence in providing CCC in pediatric residents. We performed a retrospective, multi-center, cohort study utilizing data from the Pediatric Resident Burnout and Resilience Study (PRB-RSC) from 2016 to 2018. The Calm Compassionate Care Scale (CCCS) was used to assess confidence in delivering CCC. We examined cross-sectional associations between CCC, demographic measures, programmatic features, and psychological scales. The following showed significant positive associations with confidence in providing CCC: Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale, Neff's Self Compassion, Patient Reported Outcomes Measures-mental health, and Interpersonal Reactivity Index-empathetic concern. For the Maslach Burnout Index subscales, decreased personal accomplishment, increased emotional exhaustion, and increased depersonalization showed significant negative associations. We found that several well-being measures and an increased sense of personal accomplishment are associated with increased confidence in providing CCC. These findings underscore the interrelatedness of these measures and highlight the importance of personal accomplishment as a positive factor in trainee development. Program level interventions that decrease trainee burnout and enhance resiliency as well as support trainees' development of empathy and compassion may help trainees develop skills that promote patient-centered, compassionate care.
