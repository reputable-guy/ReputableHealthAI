Study Title: The effect of music therapy on non-stress test results and anxiety levels in high-risk pregnant women: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study was conducted to determine the effects of music therapy on non-stress test results and anxiety levels in high-risk pregnant women. This randomized controlled study was conducted in pregnant women who were hospitalized in the High-Risk Pregnancy Service of Meram Medical Faculty Hospital, Konya, Turkey, between April 1 and July 31, 2021. In the intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;58), a 20-min music therapy with ney sounds was performed, while in the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;58), routine care practices were applied. H&#xfc;seyni maqam of ney was selected, a melodic mode used by Turks for music therapy. Data were collected using the Descriptive Information Form, the Non-Stress Test Evaluation Form, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. After music therapy, the intervention group experienced increased mean acceleration (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010) and foetal movement rates (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) while no such difference was observed in the control group. The state anxiety levels of pregnant women differed significantly between the intervention and control groups (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Regression analysis showed that music therapy reduced state anxiety levels in pregnant women by a factor of 4.6 (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Based on the findings, music therapy was found to enhance acceleration and foetal heart rate in high-risk pregnant women while reducing state anxiety levels.
