Study Title: Early Predictors of Recovery From Nonoperatively Treated Achilles Tendon Rupture: 1&#x2009;Year Follow-Up Study.

Study Summary:
To investigate early structural and mechanical predictors of plantarflexor muscle strength and the magnitude of Achilles tendon (AT) nonuniform displacement at 6 and 12&#x2009;months after AT rupture. Thirty-five participants (28 males and 7 females; mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD age 41.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.1&#x2009;years) were assessed for isometric plantarflexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and AT nonuniformity at 6 and 12&#x2009;months after rupture. Structural and mechanical AT and plantarflexor muscle properties were measured at 2&#x2009;months. Limb asymmetry index (LSI) was calculated for all variables. Multiple linear regression was used with the 6 and 12&#x2009;month MVC LSI and 12&#x2009;month AT nonuniformity LSI as dependent variables and AT and plantarflexor muscle properties at 2&#x2009;months as independent variables. The level of pre- and post-injury sports participation was inquired using Tegner score at 2 and 12&#x2009;months (scale 0-10, 10&#x2009;=&#x2009;best possible score). Subjective perception of recovery was assessed with Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS) at 12&#x2009;months (scale 0-100, 100=best possible score). Achilles tendon resting angle (ATRA) symmetry at 2&#x2009;months predicted MVC symmetry at 6 and 12&#x2009;months after rupture (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.530, 95% CI 1.041-4.018, adjusted R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.416, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002; &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.659, 95% CI 0.330-2.988, adjusted R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.418, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016, respectively). At 12&#x2009;months, participants had recovered their pre-injury level of sports participation (Tegner 6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2 points). The median (IQR) ATRS score was 92 (7) points at 12&#x2009;months. Greater asymmetry of ATRA in the early recovery phase may be a predictor of plantarflexor muscle strength deficits up to 1&#x2009;year after rupture. This research is a part of "nonoperative treatment of Achilles tendon rupture in Central Finland: a prospective cohort study" that has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03704532).
