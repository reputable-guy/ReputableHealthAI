Study Title: Exercise does not cause post-exertional malaise in Veterans with Gulf War Illness: A randomized, controlled, dose-response, crossover study.

Study Summary:
Chronic multisymptom illnesses (CMI) such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Long-COVID, and Gulf War Illness (GWI) are associated with an elevated risk of post-exertional malaise (PEM), an acute exacerbation of symptoms and other related outcomes following exercise. These individuals may benefit from personalized exercise prescriptions which prioritize risk minimization, necessitating a better understanding of dose-response effects of exercise intensity on PEM. Veterans with GWI (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40) completed a randomized controlled crossover experiment comparing 20&#xa0;min of seated rest to light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity cycling conditions over four separate study visits. Symptoms, pain sensitivity, cognitive performance, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and plasma cytokines) were measured before and within 1&#xa0;h after exercise and seated rest. Physical activity behavior was measured&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;7&#xa0;days following each study visit via actigraphy. Linear mixed effects regression models tested the central hypothesis that higher intensity exercise would elicit greater exacerbation of negative outcomes, as indicated by a significant condition-by-time interaction for symptom, pain sensitivity, cognitive performance, and inflammatory marker models and a significant main effect of condition for physical activity models. Significant condition-by-time interactions were not observed for primary or secondary measures of symptoms, pain sensitivity, cognitive performance, and a majority of inflammatory markers. Similarly, a significant effect of condition was not observed for primary or secondary measures of physical activity. Undesirable effects such as symptom exacerbation were observed for some participants, but the group-level risk of PEM following light-, moderate-, or vigorous-intensity exercise was no greater than seated rest. These findings challenge several prior views about PEM and lend support to a broader body of literature showing that the benefits of exercise outweigh the risks.
