Study Title: Study draft: "UVC-You Will See" study: longer vs. shorter umbilical venous catheter (UVC) dwell time (6-10 vs. 1-5&#xa0;days) in very premature infants with birth weight <&#x202f;1250&#x202f;g and/or gestational age <&#x202f;30&#xa0;weeks.

Study Summary:
Umbilical venous catheters (UVCs) are often used in preterm infants. Their use is associated with complications (infections, clot formation, organ injury). Very preterm infants with acquired bloodstream infection are at a&#xa0;higher risk for death and important morbidities (e.g., adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes). It is standard clinical practice to remove UVCs in the first days of life. Replacement of intravenous access is often performed using percutaneously inserted central catheters (PICCs). It is unclear whether serial central line use affects the rates of catheter-related complications. A&#xa0;multicenter randomized controlled trial (random group assignment) was performed in 562 very premature (gestational age <&#x202f;30&#xa0;weeks) and/or very low birth weight infants (<&#x202f;1250&#x202f;g) requiring an UVC for administration of parenteral nutrition and/or drugs. Group allocation was random. A&#xa0;UVC dwell time of 6-10&#xa0;days (281 infants) is not associated with an increased rate of central venous catheter (UVC, PICC)-related complications compared to 1-5&#xa0;days (281 infants), and a&#xa0;longer UVC dwell time will significantly reduce the number of painful, invasive procedures associated with the need for vascular access as well as radiation exposure, use of antibiotics, and medical costs. The number of catheter-related bloodstream infections and/or catheter-related thromboses and/or catheter-associated organ injuries related to the use of UVC/PICC was the primary outcome. Extending the UVC dwell time may significantly reduce the number of painful invasive procedures, with the potential to positively impact not only long-term pain perception but also important social competencies (attention, learning, and behavior). Thus, the "UVC-You Will See" study has the potential to substantially change current neonatal intensive care practice.
