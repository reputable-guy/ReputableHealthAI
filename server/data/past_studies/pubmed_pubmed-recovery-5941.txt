Study Title: Effect of an intravenous acetaminophen/ibuprofen fixed-dose combination on postoperative opioid consumption and pain after video-assisted thoracic surgery: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) often induces significant postoperative pain, potentially leading to chronic pain and decreased quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the acetaminophen/ibuprofen combination effectiveness in reducing analgesic requirements and pain intensity in patients undergoing VATS. This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Adult patients scheduled for elective VATS for lung resection were randomized to receive either intravenous acetaminophen and ibuprofen (intervention group) or 100&#xa0;mL normal saline (control group). Treatments were administered post-anesthesia induction and every 6&#xa0;h for three cycles. The primary outcome was total analgesic consumption at 24&#xa0;h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were cumulative analgesic consumption at 2 and 48&#xa0;h; analgesic-related side effects at 2, 24, and 48&#xa0;h; quality of recovery at 24&#xa0;h and 48&#xa0;h postoperatively; pain intensity at rest and during coughing; and rescue analgesics use. Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) was assessed through telephone interviews 3&#xa0;months postoperatively. The study included 96 participants. The intervention group showed significantly lower analgesic consumption at 24&#xa0;h and 48&#xa0;h postoperatively (24&#xa0;h: median difference:&#x2009;-&#x2009;100&#xa0;&#xb5;g equivalent intravenous fentanyl [95% confidence interval (CI)&#x2009;-&#x2009;200 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;5&#xa0;&#x3bc;g], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037; 48&#xa0;h: median difference:&#x2009;-&#x2009;140&#xa0;&#x3bc;g [95% CI&#x2009;-&#x2009;320 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;20&#xa0;&#x3bc;g], P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035). Compared to the controls, the intervention group exhibited a significantly lower quality of recovery 24&#xa0;h post-surgery, with no significant difference at 48&#xa0;h. All pain scores except for coughing at 48&#xa0;h post-surgery were significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the controls. No significant differences were observed between the groups in postoperative nausea and vomiting occurrence, hospital stay length, and CPSP. Perioperative administration of acetaminophen/ibuprofen significantly decreased analgesic needs in patients undergoing VATS, providing an effective postoperative pain management strategy, and potentially minimizing the need for stronger analgesics.
