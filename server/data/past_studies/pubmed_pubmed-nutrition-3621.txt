Study Title: Effects of Teduglutide on Diarrhea in Pediatric Patients with Short Bowel Syndrome-Associated Intestinal Failure.

Study Summary:
This post-hoc analysis evaluated the effect of teduglutide treatment on diarrhea in patients with short bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure (SBS-IF). Data from 2 open-label, multicenter, phase 3 pediatric SBS-IF clinical trials of teduglutide (NCT01952080 and NCT02682381) were pooled where possible. The primary objective was to evaluate the change in stool consistency, frequency, and volume from baseline to weeks 12 and 24 of treatment in patients who received any teduglutide dose from both studies ("total teduglutide"). Safety assessments included gastrointestinal adverse event reporting. Overall, 101 patients were analyzed. Among the total teduglutide group (n = 87), there were significant changes from baseline to weeks 12 and 24 in mean (standard error) Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) score [-1.8 (0.26; P < 0.0001) and -2.2 (0.27; P < 0.0001), respectively], parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluid (PN/IV) volume [-16.9 (1.7; P < 0.0001) and -20.1 (2.3; P < 0.0001) mL/kg/day, respectively], and enteral nutrition volume [9.2 (1.7; P < 0.0001) and 9.6 (2.3; P = 0.0002) mL/kg/day, respectively]. Among patients in the standard of care group (n = 14) there were numerical changes in BSFS score, and enteral nutrition volume at weeks 12 and 24; significant changes in PN/IV volume [-6.9 (1.5) mL/kg/day; P = 0.0041] were observed at 24 weeks, but not at 12 weeks. In this post-hoc analysis, short-term treatment with teduglutide was associated with improved stool consistency, as well as trends towards reductions in PN/IV requirements and advancements in enteral nutrition volume in children with SBS-IF. Further research assessing the impact of patient-level factors on stool characteristics when using teduglutide is warranted.
