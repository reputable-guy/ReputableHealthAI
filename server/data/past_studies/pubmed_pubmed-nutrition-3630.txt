Study Title: Effects of nutrition education and home gardening interventions on feto-maternal outcomes among pregnant women in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia: A cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Although pro-dietary practices and associated malnutrition are modifiable risk factors, they have a significant effect on maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effect of nutritional education and home gardening promotion on feto-maternal outcomes among pregnant women. A three parallel arms community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia from August 2020 to January 2021. Eighteen selected clusters were randomly assigned into three arms: husband (pregnant woman with her husband), peers (pregnant woman with her peers), and the controls. A total of 348 pregnant women were recruited in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to the study arms at the baseline and 336 attended the end-line survey. Three nutrition education sessions and four varieties of vegetable seeds were provided for women in the intervention arms (husband and peers) and only routine nutrition education for the controls. Data were collected using a pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation analysis (GEE) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal Wallis test were used to evaluate the effect of the interventions. The intervention effect estimates were obtained through a difference-in-differences approach. In the final model, neonates born to women in the husband group were 232 g heavier than those in the control groups (&#x3b2; = 232, 95%CI: 228.00, 236.27. Similarly, women in the husband group had a 0.45 g/dl greater hemoglobin level than the control groups (&#x3b2; = 0.45, 95% CI: 36.48, 54.40). Likewise, a minimum diet diversity score was higher in the husband group as compared to the controls (&#x3b2; = 0.87 95% CI: (0.56, 1.18). Therefore, nutrition education and home gardening interventions resulted in a significant positive effect on the mean birth weight and maternal hemoglobin level among the intervention groups. The findings imply the need for enhancing such interventions to improve feto-maternal outcomes. The trial was registered at Pan African Clinical Trial Registry as PACTR202008624731801.
