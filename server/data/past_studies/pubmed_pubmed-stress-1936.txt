Study Title: Peer mentoring in pharmacy programs: Recommendations for implementation based on a review of available literature.

Study Summary:
Stress experienced by pharmacy students is on the rise and is negatively impacting student success. Pharmacy accreditation standards encourage schools to promote student success and well-being. Peer to peer student support is a largely under-investigated strategy to address this. The objective of this manuscript is to conduct a literature review on the development of peer mentoring programs for pharmacy students and describe best practices for successful implementation into pharmacy programs. This literature review identified studies using major databases, including PubMed, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Education Resources Information Center. Search terms included [(peer mentor*) AND pharmacy]. Any study that involved peer assessment, peer tutoring, or peer learning within a course, faculty mentors only, non-pharmacy students, and/or did not implement a mentor-mentee relationship, was excluded. Three studies met the criteria for inclusion. Mentorship programs varied with regard to duration, mentor recruitment, participant incentives, and overall structure. Various methods of analyses were employed. Despite major differences between the included studies, three themes were identified regarding development of peer mentoring programs: participation, support, and pairing. Active engagement led to higher perceived benefit and both mentors and mentees found the programs beneficial, agreed to recommend the programs to others, and provided positive feedback. Successful mentoring programs should aim to incorporate the following characteristics to some degree: mandatory participation by mentor and mentee as well as support for mentors with training and faculty oversight. Peer mentoring programs have a positive impact on participants. More studies are needed to assess the effects of peer mentoring in pharmacy programs. This is the first known review of peer mentoring within pharmacy programs and identifies a gap in knowledge in this area. There is a paucity of data surrounding peer mentoring in pharmacy and its potential value as a tool to improve student well-being.
