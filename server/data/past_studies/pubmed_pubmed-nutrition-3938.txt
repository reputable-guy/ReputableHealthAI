Study Title: Age-Dependent Serum Volatilomics of Milk and Yogurt Intake: A Randomized Crossover Study in Healthy Young and Older Men.

Study Summary:
Nutritional biomarkers of dairy intake can be affected by both food transformation and the metabolic status of the consumer. To assess these effects, this study investigated the serum volatilome of 14 young (YA) and 14 older (OA) adult men undergoing a 3 week restriction of dairy and fermented foods followed by a randomized crossover acute intake of milk and yogurt. 3,5-Dimethyl-octan-2-one was identified as a potential marker of dairy product intake as its response after both milk and yogurt intake was significantly increased during the postprandial phase but significantly decreased in fasting serum samples of the OA group after the restriction phase. The postprandial response of two metabolites was significantly different for the two dairy products while 19 metabolites were modulated by age. Remarkably, the response of all age-dependent metabolites was higher in the OA than in the YA group after milk or yogurt intake, whereas at the end of the restriction phase, their fasting concentrations were lower in the OA than in the YA group. Among these,-cresol, a specific marker of colonic protein fermentation, had a significant response in the OA but not the YA group, which may suggest impaired intestinal processing of dietary proteins in the OA group.
