Study Title: Integrative Medicine Elective for the Well-being of Pharmacy Students.

Study Summary:
To describe the impact of an integrative medicine elective on the well-being of pharmacy students at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and examine the relationship between perceived stress and happiness. Students completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) before and 3 months after taking the course. Our study compared the outcomes of each composite score from the PSS and SHS before and after course participation to detect any difference. The interpretation of single composite scores was analyzed similarly. The correlation of the PSS and SHS was checked to determine their relationships, and the correlation between the change in PSS and the time the students spent practicing their identified integrative modality were also analyzed to detect whether any association existed. A total of 49 students completed the prewellness and postwellness inventories over 3 offerings of the class (2020, 2022, and 2023). There was a decrease in PSS of.8 that was not statistically significant, with most students reporting moderate perceived stress on the pre-PSS and post-PSS. The average SHS was 4.7. There was a strong negative correlation between PSS and SHS. There was a moderate negative correlation between the time practicing the integrative medicine modality and postcourse PSS. This practical, hands-on experience will add nonpharmacologic tools to the pharmacy student tool kit, which could be used in patient care and pharmacy student wellness.
