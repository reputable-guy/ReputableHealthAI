Study Title: Effects of Maitland mobilization technique on upper extremity function in stroke survivors with spasticity: An experimental study.

Study Summary:
The recovery of upper limb function is of great significance for stroke patients to regain their self-care ability, yet it is still a difficult point in clinical practice of neurological rehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Maitland joint mobilization technique on the recovery of upper extremity function in patients with spasticity after stroke. From August to December 2023, 71 patients with upper extremity flexor spasm after stroke were recruited and randomly divided into experimental group (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;35) and control group (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;36). The control group was given conventional rehabilitation treatment, while the experimental group was treated with Maitland mobilization technique treatment of upper extremity joints on the basis of the control group. The experiment lasted for 8 weeks. Participants of the 2 groups were observed for Fugl-Meyer motor assessment-upper extremity (FMA-UE), box and block test (BBT) and Brunnstrom stage, modified Ashworth scale (MAS), and functional independence measure (FIM) at pre- and post-8 weeks study. There was no significant difference in gender distribution, hemiplegic side, diagnosis, past history, age, duration, body mass index, and mini-mental state examination between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). After 8 weeks of intervention, both groups showed significant improvement in FMA-UE, Brunnstrom stage, BBT, FIM, and MAS of the shoulder (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); however, there was no significant change in MAS of the elbow, wrist, and finger joints (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). The posttreatment values showed a significant improvement in FMA-UE, BBT, and FIM in the experimental group compared to the control group. Comparing the changes in pretreatment and posttreatment, FMA-UE, BBT, and FIM in the experimental group were significantly improved compared with those in the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Maitland joint mobilization can improve the motor function of upper extremity and the spasticity of shoulder joint complex in patients with stroke.
