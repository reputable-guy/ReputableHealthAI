Study Title: Meditation involving people with cancer, medical staff and witnesses: a pilot study exploring improvement in wellness and connectedness.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness meditation is likely to promote better management of stress, pain and negative emotions. We propose to address the benefit of meditation in an open setting associating people with cancer (target population), medical staff and witnesses (neither patient nor medical staff). This study aims (1) to evaluate the effects of meditation on wellness improvement and (2) to identify criteria and modalities for a subsequent randomised study. We propose a longitudinal pilot study consisting of a non-randomised experimental preintervention/postintervention survey. The intervention consists in delivering a meditation programme (12 weekly meditation sessions of 1.5&#x2009;hours each), specifically adapted to our target population and addressing our research hypothesis in an open setting involving people with cancer, medical staff and witnesses (equally distributed in two groups of 15 participants). The main objective is to evaluate participants' adherence to the programme. The effects of meditation will be evaluated on stress, quality of life, feeling of personal effectiveness, on the development of mindfulness and empathy, and on satisfaction and perception of a change in quality of life. We will also measure the putative added value of 'meditating together'. This study is expected to allow validating the evaluation tools and refining the modalities of the workshops. We expect to demonstrate the evolution that this meditation-based intervention induces in the participants. We aim to promote bridge-building, between patients, medical staff but also others. In this way, one's own suffering may be understood in the light of others' suffering, thereby promoting the sense of otherness and giving insights into 'living better with'. This exploratory study will investigate the relevance of this hypothesis, which could then be explored by a randomised study. The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (Comit&#xe9; de Protection des Personnes Est II). Trial findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals. NCT04410185.
