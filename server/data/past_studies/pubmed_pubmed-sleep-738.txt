Study Title: Personal versus therapist perioperative music intervention: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Music interventions can alleviate patient anxiety and improve post-surgical satisfaction. However, it remains uncertain whether personal music preferences affect efficacy. The authors tested whether personal music intervention with patient-selected songs played ad libitum is more effective than standard therapist-designed treatment with classical music. A prospective, parallel-group, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with 229 participants (aged 18-60&#xa0;years) previously scheduled for elective surgery. Data analyses followed a modified intention-to-treat principle. The patients were randomized into three groups: Standard care without music (Control), therapist-designed classic music treatment (TT), or personal music intervention with patient-selected songs played ad libitum by the patient (PI). All patients received standard post-anaesthesia care, and music intervention was started upon arrival at the post-anaesthesia care unit. Primary outcomes were anxiety and overall satisfaction at discharge. In contrast, secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure during music intervention, the sleep quality of the night after surgery, and the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting within the first 24 h after surgery. Compared with therapist-designed music treatment, personal intervention decreased systolic blood pressure (T 0 : 124.3&#xb1;13.7, 95% CI:121-127.7; T 20min : 117.6&#xb1;10.4, 95% CI:115-120.1; T 30min : 116.9&#xb1;10.6, 95% CI:114.3-119.4), prevented postoperative nausea and vomiting (Control: 55.9%, TT: 64.6%, PI: 77.6%), including severe postoperative nausea (VAS score>4; Control: 44.1%; TT: 33.8%; PI: 20.9%) and severe emesis (Frequency&#x2265;3, Control: 13.2%; TT: 7.7%; PI: 4.5%). None of the treatments affected sleep quality at night after surgery (Median, Q1-Q3, Control: 3, 1-3; TT: 3, 1-4; PI: 3, 1-3.5). Personal, but not therapist, music intervention significantly prevented anxiety (Control: 36.4&#xb1;5.9, 95% CI:35.0-37.9; TT: 36.2&#xb1;7.1, 95% CI: 34.4-37.9; PI: 33.8&#xb1;5.6, 95% CI: 32.4-35.2) and emesis (Control: 23.9%; TT: 23.4%; PI: 13.2%) and improved patient satisfaction (Median, Q1-Q3, C: 8, 6-8; TT: 8, 7-9; PI: 8, 7-9). Personal music intervention improved postoperative systolic blood pressure, anxiety, nausea, emesis, and overall satisfaction, but not sleep quality, as compared to therapist-designed classic intervention.
