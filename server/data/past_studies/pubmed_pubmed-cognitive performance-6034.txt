Study Title: Implicit learning provides advantage over explicit learning for gait-cognitive dual-task interference.

Study Summary:
Dual-task performance holds significant relevance in real-world scenarios. Implicit learning is a possible approach for improving dual-task performance. Analogy learning, utilizing a single metaphor to convey essential information about motor skills, has emerged as a practical method for fostering implicit learning. However, evidence supporting the effect of implicit learning on gait-cognitive dual-task performance is insufficient. This exploratory study aimed to examine the effects of implicit and explicit learning on dual-task performance in both gait and cognitive tasks. Tandem gait was employed on a treadmill to assess motor function, whereas serial seven subtraction tasks were used to gauge cognitive performance. Thirty healthy community-dwelling older individuals were randomly assigned to implicit or explicit learning groups. Each group learned the tandem gait task according to their individual learning styles. The implicit learning group showed a significant improvement in gait performance under the dual-task condition compared with the explicit learning group. Furthermore, the implicit learning group exhibited improved dual-task interference for both tasks. Our findings suggest that implicit learning may offer greater advantages than explicit learning in acquiring autonomous motor skills. Future research is needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying implicit learning and to harness its potential for gait-cognitive dual-task performance in clinical settings.
