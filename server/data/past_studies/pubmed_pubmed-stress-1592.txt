Study Title: Evaluating the impact of short-term nitrate-rich dietary supplementation on endothelial function in COPD: A randomized crossover study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of dietary nitrate ingestion through l-arginine supplementation or dehydrated beet consumption on endothelial function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The secondary outcome was to analyze arterial stiffness, plasma nitrate, and nitrate/protein concentration. In this randomized crossover study, subjects with COPD underwent three series of supplementation: (1) l-arginine, (2) dehydrated beetroot, and (3) a placebo that appeared like the other supplements. Each intervention lasted 14 days, with a 7-day washout period between series. Participants underwent endothelial function assessment using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and plasma nitrate levels were measured at the end of each supplementation series. Seventeen subjects (twelve male) completed the study protocol. Only five subjects presented endothelial dysfunction (RHI &#x2264;0.51) at baseline. The mean baseline characteristics included age 66.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9.4 years, BMI 27.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.5&#xa0;kg/m, FEV0.79 (0.67-1.06) L. There were no differences (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05) between the groups or from pre-to post-interventions for RHI and arterial stiffness index (AIx) values, as well as parameters of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, such as blood flow velocity (BFV), shear stress, shear rate, FMD (mm), and FMD%. There was also no differences (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05) between the groups or from pre-to post-interventions plasma nitrate levels. Acute dietary supplementation with nitrates, at the doses provided, did not show a significant improvement in endothelial function assessed by FMD, EndoPAT, or plasma nitrate levels in COPD. These findings suggest that a higher dose or prolonged supplementation might be required to achieve a therapeutic effect.
