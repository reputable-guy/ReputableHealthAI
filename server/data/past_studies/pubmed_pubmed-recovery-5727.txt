Study Title: Analgesic effects of ultrasound-guided preoperative posterior Quadratus Lumborum block in laparoscopic hepatectomy: A prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To determine if single-injection bilateral posterior quadratus lumborum block (QLB) with ropivacaine would improve postoperative analgesia in the first 24&#xa0;h after laparoscopic hepatectomy, compared with 0.9% saline. Prospective, double blinded, randomized controlled trial. A single tertiary care center from November 2021 and January 2023. A total of 94 patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic hepatectomy due to hepatocellular carcinoma. Ninety-four patients were randomized into a QLB group (receiving 20&#xa0;mL of 0.375% ropivacaine on each side, 150&#xa0;mg in total) or a control group (receiving 20&#xa0;mL of 0.9% saline on each side). The primary outcome was the cumulative opioid consumption during the initial 24-h post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and intraoperative and recovery parameters. The mean cumulative opioid consumption during the initial 24-h post-surgery was 30.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;22.4&#xa0;mg in the QLB group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;46) and 34.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;19.4&#xa0;mg in the control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;46, mean differences: -3.3&#xa0;mg, 95% confidence interval, -11.9 to 5.4, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.457). The mean resting pain score at 1&#xa0;h post-surgery was significantly lower in the QLB group than in the control group (5 [4-6.25] vs. 7 [4.75-8], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.035). No significant intergroup differences were observed in the resting or coughing pain scores at other time points or in other secondary outcomes. Preoperative bilateral posterior QLB did not reduce cumulative opioid consumption during the first 24&#xa0;h after laparoscopic hepatectomy.
