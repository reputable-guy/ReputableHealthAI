Study Title: Risk factors for moderate acute malnutrition among children with acute diarrhoea in India and Tanzania: a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) affects over 30 million children aged&#x2009;<&#x2009;5&#xa0;years worldwide. MAM may confer a greater risk of developing severe malnutrition and even mortality in children. Assessing risk factors for MAM may allow for earlier recognition of children at risk of deleterious health outcomes. To determine risk factors associated with the prevalence and development of MAM among children aged 6 to 59&#xa0;months with acute diarrhoea who received treatment with oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized, dose-finding trial of zinc among children with acute diarrhoea in India and Tanzania. We used regression models to assess risk factors for prevalent MAM at the start of diarrhoea treatment and to identify risk factors associated with the development of MAM at 60&#xa0;days. MAM was defined as weight for length (or height) Z score&#x2009;&#x2264;-2 and&#x2009;>&#x2009;-3 or mid-upper arm circumference&#x2009;<&#x2009;12.5 and&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;11.5&#xa0;cm. A total of 4,500 children were enrolled; 593 (13.2%) had MAM at the baseline. MAM at baseline was significantly less common among children in Tanzania than in India (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30, 0.44, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), in children aged 24-&#x2009;<&#x2009;60&#xa0;months versus 6-&#x2009;<&#x2009;12&#xa0;months (aRR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.56, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and in families with household wealth index higher than the median (aRR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.92, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Sixty days after outpatient treatment and follow-up, 87 (2.5%) children developed MAM. When compared to children aged 6-&#x2009;<&#x2009;12&#xa0;months, children aged 24-&#x2009;<&#x2009;60&#xa0;months had a 52% lower risk of developing MAM. Every one unit increase in weight for length (or height) Z score at enrolment was associated with a 93% lower risk of developing MAM during follow-up. Among children with diarrhoea, younger children and those from households with lower wealth were at greater risk of MAM. These children may benefit from targeted interventions focusing on feeding (targeted nutrition support for at-risk households) and follow up in order to reduce the occurrence of MAM and its consequences.
