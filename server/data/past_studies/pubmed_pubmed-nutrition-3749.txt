Study Title: Healthy Eating in the Australian Coal Mining Industry: Assessing the Efficacy of the 'Out of the Box' Workplace Health Promotion Program.

Study Summary:
Noncommunicable diseases are the world's leading cause of death. To curb the global rise in these diseases, using the workplace as a front to disseminate health communication messages and resources has been suggested. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a workplace health promotion program, 'Out of the Box', that targeted nutrition outcomes and nutrition guideline knowledge. A 6-month workplace health promotion program was implemented within a coal mine site. Over the 6 months, there were four wellness focus areas, lasting 1 month each, including fruits, vegetables and portion controlling, label reading, alcohol awareness, and hydration promotion. The study utilized a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design, with measurements via self-reported paper-based surveys. At baseline there were 163 responses, and 106 at follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up, respondents had increased odds of recalling the current fruit (OR 1.29,= 0.032) and vegetable (OR 1.76,< 0.001) guidelines. Being male was associated with lower vegetable intake (B: -0.28), although this did not reach statistical significance. A nutrition-focused workplace health promotion program can be an efficacious strategy in improving knowledge of fruit and vegetable guidelines. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs over time.
