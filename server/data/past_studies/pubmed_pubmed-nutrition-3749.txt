Study Title: Concept of an Intervention for Sustainable Weight Loss in Postmenopausal Women with Overweight-Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Dietary Intervention Study.

Study Summary:
The approach of an individual diet has great potential for sustainable weight reduction. Social support, participation and empowerment are also key factors for high motivation and compliance. So, the impact of an individual diet in combination with group sessions on weight loss in postmenopausal women with overweight was investigated. In this reanalysis of a controlled intervention study, postmenopausal women (= 54; BMI 30.9 &#xb1; 3.4 kg/m; 59 &#xb1; 7 years) were recruited receiving an energy restricted diet for 12 weeks, followed by a six-month follow-up phase. The women received 51 individual meal plans based on their habits and were trained in four group sessions. Forty-six women completed the intervention phase, and 29 completed the follow-up. Average weight loss was -5.8 &#xb1; 3.0 kg (< 0.001) after 12 weeks and was still significant at follow-up (-4.9 &#xb1; 5.4 kg,< 0.001). Also, decreases in fat-free mass (-1.1 &#xb1; 1.2 kg,< 0.001) and resting energy expenditure (-1096 &#xb1; 439 kJ/24 h,< 0.001) were observed. The individual nutrition approach with a focus on nutritype in combination with group sessions was effective for long-lasting weight loss in postmenopausal women. An important factor is close individual and group support.
