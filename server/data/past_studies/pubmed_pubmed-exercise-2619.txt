Study Title: Efficacy and safety of macitentan in Fontan-palliated patients: 52-week randomized, placebo-controlled RUBATO Phase 3 trial and open-label extension.

Study Summary:
The efficacy and safety of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, were assessed in a 52-week, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study assessing the efficacy and safety of macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent patients (RUBATO-DB) and an open-label extension trial (RUBATO-OL). Patients aged 12&#xa0;years and older with New York Heart Association functional class II or III underwent total cavopulmonary connection more than 1&#xa0;year before screening and showed no signs of Fontan failure/clinical deterioration. In RUBATO-DB, the primary efficacy end point was change in peak oxygen consumption from baseline to week 16; secondary end points were change from baseline over 52&#xa0;weeks in peak oxygen consumption and change in mean count/minute of daily physical activity via accelerometer from baseline to week 16. Safety was assessed&#xa0;throughout both studies. In RUBATO-DB, 137 patients were randomized to macitentan 10&#xa0;mg (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;68) or placebo (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;69); 92.7% completed 52-week double-blind treatment. At week 16, mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD change in peak oxygen consumption was -0.16&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.86 versus -0.67&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.66&#xa0;mL/kg/minute with macitentan versus placebo (median unbiased treatment difference estimate, 0.62&#xa0;mL/kg/minute [99% repeated CI, -0.62 to 1.85]; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.19). No treatment effect was observed in either of the secondary end points. During RUBATO-DB, most common adverse events with macitentan were headache, nasopharyngitis, and pyrexia. Across RUBATO-DB and RUBATO-OL, most common adverse events were COVID-19, headache, and fatigue. RUBATO-OL was prematurely discontinued because RUBATO-DB did not meet its primary or secondary end point. The primary end point of RUBATO-DB was not met; macitentan did&#xa0;not improve exercise capacity versus placebo in patients with Fontan palliation. Macitentan was generally well tolerated over long-term treatment.
