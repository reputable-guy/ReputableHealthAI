Study Title: Can cerebellar theta-burst stimulation improve balance function and gait in stroke patients? A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The cerebellum is a key structure involved in balance and motor control, and has become a new stimulation target in brain regulation technology. Interference theta-burst simulation (iTBS) is a novel simulation mode of repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation. However, the impact of cerebellar iTBS on balance function and gait in stroke patients is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether cerebellar iTBS can improve function, particularly balance and gait, in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. This study is a randomized, double-blind, sham controlled clinical trial. The study was carried out at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine in a general hospital. Patients with stroke with first unilateral lesions were enrolled in the study. Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to the cerebellar iTBS group or sham stimulation group. The cerebellar iTBS or pseudo stimulation site is the ipsilateral cerebellum on the paralyzed side, which is completed just before daily physical therapy. The study was conducted five times a week for two consecutive weeks. All patients were assessed before the intervention (T0) and at the end of 2 weeks of treatment (T1), respectively. The primary outcome was the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), while secondary outcome measures included the Fugl Meyer Lower Limb Assessment Scale (FMA-LE), timed up and go (TUG), Barthel Index (BI), and gait analysis. After 2 weeks of intervention, the BBS, FMA-LE, TUG, and BI score in both the iTBS group and the sham group were significantly improved compared to the baseline (all P<0.05). Also, there was a significant gait parameter improvement including the cadence, stride length, velocity, step length compared to the baseline (P<0.05) in the iTBS group, but only significant improvement in cadence was identified in the sham group (P<0.05). Intergroup comparison showed that the BBS (P<0.001), FMA-LE (P<0.001), and BI (P=0.002) in the iTBS group were significantly higher than those in the sham group, and the TUG in the iTBS was significantly lower than that in the sham group (P=0.002). In addition, there were significant differences in cadence (P=0.029), strip length (P=0.046), gain velocity (P=0.002), and step length of affected lower limb (P=0.024) between the iTBS group and the sham iTBS group. Physical therapy is able to improve the functional recovery in hemiplegic patients after stroke, but the cerebellar iTBS can facilitate and accelerate the recovery, particularly the balance function and gait. Cerebellar iTBS could be an efficient and facilitative treatment for patients with stroke. Cerebellar iTBS provides a convenient and efficient treatment modality for functional recovery of patients with stroke, especially balance function and gait.
