Study Title: Telenutrition Education Is Effective for Glycemic Management in People with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial in Japan.

Study Summary:
This study examined the non-inferior efficacy of telenutrition education compared with face-to-face nutrition education in managing glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Participants had T2DM and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ranged 6.5-9.5%. Thirty participants were randomly assigned to either the telenutrition or face-to-face nutrition education group. During the 32-week intervention period, the participants received four sessions on nutrition education from a registered dietitian at the hospital. The telenutrition group received remote education via a videoconferencing platform. Face-to-face nutrition education was conducted using paper-based instructions. The main outcome measure was the non-inferiority of HbA1c levels in the telenutrition group compared to the face-to-face nutrition group. The non-inferiority of telenutrition education was considered valid if the intergroup difference in the mean values of the change in HbA1c had a bilateral 95% confidence interval (CI) upper limit below 0.40%. The intergroup difference in the mean HbA1c change from baseline to the fourth nutrition education session was -0.11 (95% CI -0.54-0.32) for both groups. The upper limit of the bilateral 95% CI was 0.32%, which was below the 0.40% non-inferiority margin (non-inferiority test;= 0.011). Telenutrition education was not inferior to face-to-face nutrition education for glycemic management in people with T2DM.
