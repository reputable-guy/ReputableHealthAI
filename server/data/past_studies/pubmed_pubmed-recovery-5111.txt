Study Title: Efficacy of honey suppositories in treating paediatric functional constipation: A comparative study.

Study Summary:
This study sought to assess the clinical efficacy of honey suppositories in managing functional constipation in pre-school children, with a focus on those exhibiting Yin deficiency and intestinal dryness according to traditional Chinese medicine principles. The investigation aimed to determine whether honey suppositories could serve as a safer and more efficacious alternative to standard treatments. A randomised controlled trial was conducted involving pre-school children diagnosed with functional constipation. They were allocated to either a control group or a treatment group. While both groups received standard care, the treatment group also received honey suppositories. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated based on the 'Guiding Principles for Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicines', and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0. Following treatment, the treatment group demonstrated significantly lower constipation scoring system scores and higher bowel movement frequencies compared with the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The clinical efficacy of the treatment group was notably superior, with a higher rate of complete recovery and effectiveness observed (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between the groups, confirming the comparability of the study cohorts. Honey suppositories offer a promising therapeutic intervention for paediatric functional constipation, with significant clinical benefits over standard care.
