Study Title: Cognitive behavioral rehabilitation for bipolar disorder patients: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Bipolar disorder is frequently associated with cognitive impairment even during euthymia. Previous studies have reported significant impairments in functional and quality of life outcomes and a possible relationship between these variables and cognitive performance. Cognitive rehabilitation interventions have been proposed to address these outcomes but positive results are still scarce. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new intervention developed to address both cognitive and functional impairment. Thirty-nine individuals were included in this randomized controlled trial. All participants were evaluated by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and completed functional and quality of life (QOL) scales. Patients were randomized to either treatment as usual (TAU) or Cognitive Behavior Rehabilitation (CBR), an add-on treatment delivered in 12 weekly group sessions. All individuals were revaluated after 12&#xa0;weeks. A total of 39 bipolar type I or II patients were included in the analysis, 19 in the TAU group and 20 in the CBR condition. At the entrance of the study, both groups were statistically similar regarding clinical, socio-demographics and cognitive variables. After the end of the intervention, CBR individuals had significantly improved reaction time, visual memory and emotion recognition. In contrast, individuals in the CBR did not present a statistically change in functional and QOL scores after the 12-week intervention. CBR intervention showed promising results in improving some of the commonly impaired cognitive domains in BD. A longer follow-up period may be necessary to detect changes in functional and QOL domains.
