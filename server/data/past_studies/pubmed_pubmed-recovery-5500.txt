Study Title: Effect of care intervention with a health education form for breastfeeding on breast distension, pain, and lactation in postpartum mothers.

Study Summary:
Breastfeeding not only meets the nutritional needs of newborn growth and development but also promotes uterine contraction and discharge of lochia, which helps in maternal recovery. However, some mothers experience abnormal lactation and breast swelling due to a lack of breastfeeding knowledge, painful cesarean incisions, anesthesia, negative emotions, and other factors, resulting in a reduced breastfeeding rate, which adversely affects neonatal and maternal health. To explore the effects of care intervention with a health education form for breastfeeding on breastfeeding-related conditions. In this study, 207 mothers with postpartum breast pain and difficulty lactating were selected and divided into intervention and control groups using a random number table. Both groups of mothers were provided with basic nursing and related treatment measures after delivery. The intervention group additionally received care intervention with a health education form for breastfeeding. The scores of lactation volume, breast distension and pain, breastfeeding rate, breastfeeding self-efficacy, treatment effect, and complication rate of the two groups were compared. After treatment, the breast pain score of the intervention group was significantly lower than that of the control group, while the lactation score, score of Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale Short Form scale, parent-child communication score, maternal-infant interaction score, total score of maternal-infant communication, and breastfeeding rate of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. After intervention, the overall therapeutic effect of the intervention group was better than that of the control group, and the complication rate of the intervention group was lower than that of the control group. Breastfeeding health education and nursing intervention combined with basic clinical treatment have good clinical effects in managing postpartum breast distension and pain and increasing lactation yield.
