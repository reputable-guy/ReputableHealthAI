Study Title: Euglena gracilis (Euglena) powder supplementation enhanced immune function through natural killer cell activity in apparently healthy participants: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Euglena gracilis (Euglena) is a microalgae found in most freshwater environments that produces paramylon, an insoluble &#x3b2;-1,3-glucan linked to human immunity. We hypothesized that Euglena powder has effects on immune function in apparently healthy adults. The study included male or female volunteers between the ages of 20 and 70 years who had white blood cell counts ranging from 4&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;10/&#xb5;L to 10&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;10/&#xb5;L, a "severe" rating on the stress questionnaire from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and at least 2 upper respiratory infections with cold-like symptoms in the previous year. Participants received either a placebo or 700 mg of Euglena powder daily for 8 weeks. The study measured natural killer cell activity, cytokine concentrations, and blood lipid profiles to confirm the immune effect of Euglena consumption. In conclusion, Euglena improved immunological function through natural killer cell activity. Safety assessment showed no significant changes in vital signs or clinical chemistry indicators, and there were no adverse events associated with Euglena consumption. Euglena supplementation may help boost the immune systems of healthy individuals.
