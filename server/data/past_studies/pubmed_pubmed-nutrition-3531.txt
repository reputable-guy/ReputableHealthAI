Study Title: A cross-sectional study on stool- and gastrointestinal-related outcomes of Mexican infants consuming different formulae.

Study Summary:
Immaturities present at birth, such as in the gut microbiome and digestive, nervous, and immune system, resolve with time. Nevertheless, this may result in mild digestive symptoms early in life, particularly in formula-fed infants. Formula composition and processing may impact this discomfort. This study therefore aimed to assess stool characteristics and gastrointestinal symptoms of healthy infants fed different formulae. A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational trial was performed in Mexico between November 2019 and January 2022, where exclusively formula-fed infants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;342, aged 1-4 months) were studied in four groups based on their existing formula use. Feeding was continued per practice following label instructions. For 7 days, parents/caregivers were requested to record fecal characteristics, using the Amsterdam Infant Stool Scale, and rate gastrointestinal symptoms. Stool samples were collected to determine pH, dry matter content, and fecal calprotectin levels. Most infants had a soft/formed stool consistency, although odds for hard stools were different between groups. Gastrointestinal symptom scores revealed significant differences for burping and diarrhea, while other symptoms did not differ between groups. No significant differences between groups were found for stool frequency, dry matter content, and fecal pH. Although calprotectin was within the expected healthy ranges, significant differences among groups were seen. Furthermore, calprotectin significantly correlated with the severity of the gastrointestinal symptoms burping, flatulence, abdominal distension, and diarrhea. Differences in stool characteristics and specific differences in gastrointestinal symptoms were observed between different formula brand users. This may potentially be explained by the different composition and processing of the formulae, although there are multiple factors that influence the assessed outcomes. The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Registry (NL7805), linked to https://trialsearch.who.int/ , on 11/06/2019.
