Study Title: Using Body Composition Analysis for Improved Nutritional Intervention in Septic Patients: A Prospective Interventional Study.

Study Summary:
The study aimed to determine whether using body composition data acquired through bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) to adjust diet formulas could improve outcomes in septic patients. There were 132 septic patients in medical intensive care units enrolled in the prospective, randomized, double-blind, interventional study. For the intervention group, dietitians had access to BIA data for adjusting diet formulas according to body composition variables on days 1, 3, and 8. The patients were also stratified based on nutritional risk using the modified Nutrition Risk in Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score. Patients with intervention were more likely to achieve caloric and protein intake goals compared to the control group, especially in the low-risk group. The intervention did not significantly affect mortality, but the survival curves suggested potential benefits. The high-risk group had longer ICU stays and mechanical ventilation duration, which were mitigated by the intervention. Certain body composition variables (e.g., extracellular water to total body water ratio and phase angle) showed differences between high-risk and low-risk groups and may be related to patient outcomes. Non-invasive body composition assessment using BIA can help dietitians adjust diet formulas for critically ill septic patients. Body composition variables may be associated with sepsis outcomes, but further research with larger patient numbers is needed to confirm these findings.
