Study Title: Effects of an individualized nutritional educational program in pregnant women: A randomized controlled trial in Japan.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness of an individualized nutritional education program in promoting adequate nutrient intake in pregnant women. A stratified randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were stratified by factors affecting the primary outcome and randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. Intervention group participants received an individualized 30-min booklet-based education program in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters; the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was protein intake after the intervention, which was compared between the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes included comparing the amount of increase of protein before and after the intervention. Nutrient intake was measured using a self-administered short dietary history questionnaire, and analyses of covariance and t tests were performed. Of the 130 participants, 66 were assigned to the intervention group and 64 to the control group. There was no difference in protein intake between the two groups after the intervention (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.051, 95% CI [-0.021, 12.4]). Comparing the increase in protein intake before and after intervention, the intervention group was 7.4&#x2009;g/day higher than that of the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.040; F&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.31; effect size&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36). The primary outcome, a comparison of protein intake between the groups after the program, revealed no significant differences. However, on comparing the amount of protein increase before and after the intervention, the intervention group's increase was significantly higher than that of the control group. Results indicate the potential for individualized face-to-face interventions for pregnant women in Japan.
