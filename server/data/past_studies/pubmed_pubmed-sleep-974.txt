Study Title: Trial Readiness of Cavernous Malformations With Symptomatic Hemorrhage, Part I: Event Rates and Clinical Outcome.

Study Summary:
Cerebral cavernous malformation with symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are targets for novel therapies. A multisite trial-readiness project (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03652181) aimed to identify clinical, imaging, and functional changes in these patients. We enrolled adult cerebral cavernous malformation patients from 5 high-volume centers with SH within the prior year and no planned surgery. In addition to clinical and imaging review, we assessed baseline, 1- and 2-year National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale, European Quality of Life 5D-3 L, and patient-reported outcome-measurement information system, Version 2.0. SH and asymptomatic change rates were adjudicated. Changes in functional scores were assessed as a marker for hemorrhage. One hundred twenty-three, 102, and 69 patients completed baseline, 1- and 2-year clinical assessments, respectively. There were 21 SH during 178.3 patient years of follow-up (11.8% per patient year). At baseline, 62.6% and 95.1% of patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of 1 and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 0 to 4, respectively, which improved to 75.4% (=0.03) and 100% (=0.06) at 2 years. At baseline, 74.8% had at least one abnormal patient-reported outcome-measurement information system, Version 2.0 domain compared with 61.2% at 2 years (=0.004). The most common abnormal European Quality of Life 5D-3 L domains were pain (48.7%), anxiety (41.5%), and participation in usual activities (41.4%). Patients with prospective SH were more likely than those without SH to display functional decline in sleep, fatigue, and social function patient-reported outcome-measurement information system, Version 2.0 domains at 2 years. Other score changes did not differ significantly between groups at 2 years. The sensitivity of scores as an SH marker remained poor at the time interval assessed. We report SH rate, functional, and patient-reported outcomes in trial-eligible cerebral cavernous malformation with SH patients. Functional outcomes and patient-reported outcomes generally improved over 2 years. No score change was highly sensitive or specific for SH and could not be used as a primary end point in a trial.
