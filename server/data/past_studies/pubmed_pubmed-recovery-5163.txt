Study Title: The effects of a 6-week intervention with Limosilactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 alone and in combination with L. reuteri DSM 17938 on gut barrier function, immune markers, and symptoms in patients with IBS-D-An exploratory RCT.

Study Summary:
An increased intestinal permeability is a common feature in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Probiotics have shown to improve IBS symptoms and might also affect intestinal barrier function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 6-week intervention with Limosilactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 alone (single strain) or in combination with Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (dual strain) on gut barrier function, immune markers, and symptoms in IBS-D patients (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03986476). 65 IBS-D patients were randomised into three groups (placebo, single strain, dual strain). Small and large intestinal permeability were assessed using a multi-sugar urinary recovery test. Blood, saliva, faecal samples, and several symptom scales were collected before, and after three and six weeks of intervention. Small and large intestinal permeability as well as other markers of gut barrier function were not significantly affected by the probiotic interventions. Serum IL-6 levels showed a tendency to be reduced in the single strain group (descriptive p = 0.052). In addition, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly reduced in the dual strain group (p = 0.041). The participants in both treatment groups reported less gastrointestinal symptoms after three weeks, but this reached significance only in the dual strain group (total score: p = 0.032, pain subscore: p = 0.028). After six weeks, none of the assessed symptoms were significantly different from the placebo. The probiotic compounds investigated in this study did not seem to affect IBS-D patients' gut barrier function, but showed potential anti-inflammatory and symptom-improving properties, which need to be confirmed in larger study cohorts.
