Study Title: Effect of Bilateral Erector Spinae Plane Block versus Fentanyl Infusion on Postoperative Recovery in Cardiac Surgeries via Median Sternotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the effect of ultrasound-guided bilateral erector spinae plane block (ESPB) on the time to extubation in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery through a midline sternotomy. Randomized controlled trial. Cairo University Hospital and National Heart Institute, Egypt. Patients aged 18 to 70 years who underwent a cardiac surgical procedure through a midline sternotomy. Recruited patients were randomized to receive either preoperative single-shot ultrasound-guided bilateral ESPB or fentanyl infusion. The primary outcome was the time to extubation. Other outcomes included total perioperative fentanyl consumption, pain score using the numerical rating score (NRS), length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and incidence of perioperative complications. Two hundred and nineteen patients were available for final analysis. The mean time to extubation was significantly shorter In the ESPB group compared to the control group (159.5 &#xb1; 109.5 minutes vs 303.2 &#xb1; 95.9 minutes; mean difference, -143.7 minutes; 95% confidence interval, -171.1 to -116.3 minutes; p = 0.0001). Ultra-fast track (immediate postoperative) extubation was achieved in 23 patients (21.1%) in the ESPB group compared to only 1 patient (0.9%) in the control group. The ICU stay was significantly reduced in the ESPB group compared to the control group (mean, 47.2 &#xb1; 13.3 hours vs 78.9 &#xb1; 25.2 hours; p = 0.0001). There was a more significant reduction in NRS in the ESPB group compared to the control group for up to 24 hours postoperatively (p = 0.001). Among adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery through a midline sternotomy, the extubation time was halved in patients who received single-shot bilateral ESPB compared to patients who received fentanyl infusion.
