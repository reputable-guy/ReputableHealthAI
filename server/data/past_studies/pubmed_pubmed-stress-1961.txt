Study Title: Effects of proof-of-concept training on reducing work stress and anxiety of &#xa0;junior&#xa0;medical staff: a randomized controlled trial proof-of-concept.

Study Summary:
Psychological stress and anxiety have seriously affected the ability of new clinicians to adapt and coordinate their clinical work. Traditional pre-job training is often not very good at assisting new recruits to regulate their emotional problems. This study is a randomized controlled study. A total of 435 newly recruited clinicians participated in the study. 428 clinicians were randomized into a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;214) and an intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;214). The control group conducted regular pre-job training. Doctors of the intervention group attend a themed course every two weeks on the basis of regular induction training. Their physiological status was evaluated by Perceived Stress Scale (PPS-10), Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) and Psychological Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10) 3&#xa0;months later. Participants in the intervention group received a training satisfaction questionnaire. After entering the clinic for 3&#xa0;months, the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scores of the intervention group were significantly lower than that of the control group. Consistently, the CD-RISC-10 score of new clinicians who received proof-of-concept pre-job training was significantly higher than that of new doctors in the control group. New doctors received the proof-of-concept group experienced alleviation in stress and anxiety.
