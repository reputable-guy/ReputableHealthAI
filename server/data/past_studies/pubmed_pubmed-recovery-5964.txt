Study Title: Phase 1 randomized trial of inpatient high-intensity interval training after major surgery.

Study Summary:
High-intensity interval training (HIT) can provide physiologic benefits and may improve postoperative recovery but has not been evaluated in inpatients. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HIT after major surgery. We performed a phase I randomized study comparing HIT with low-intensity continuous ambulation (40&#xa0;m) during the initial inpatient stay after major surgery at a large academic center. Clinicopathologic and pre- and post-exercise physiologic data were captured. Perceived exertion was measured throughout the intervention. Twenty-two subjects were enrolled and randomized with 90% (20 subjects, 10 per arm) completing all aspects of the study. One patient declined participation in the exercise intervention. The HIT and continuous ambulation groups were relatively similar in terms of median age (65.5 vs 63.5), female sex (20% vs 40%), White race (90% vs 90%), having a cancer diagnosis (100% vs 80%), undergoing gastrointestinal surgery (60% vs 80%), median Karnofsky score (60 vs 60), and ability to independently ambulate preoperatively (100% vs 90%). All subjects completed the exercise without protocol deviation, cohort crossover, or safety events. Compared with the continuous ambulation group, the HIT group had higher end median perceived exertion (5.0 [IQR, 5.5] vs 3.0 [IQR, 1.8]), shorter overall time to complete assigned exercise (56.6 seconds vs 91.8 seconds), and a trend toward higher median gait speed over 40&#xa0;m (0.71&#xa0;m/s vs 0.44&#xa0;m/s, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.126). HIT in the hospitalized postoperative patient is safe and may be implemented to help promote positive physiologic outcomes and recovery.
