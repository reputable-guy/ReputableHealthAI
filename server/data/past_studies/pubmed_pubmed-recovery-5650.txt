Study Title: subsp.LPL-RH improves postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms and nutrition indexes by regulating the gut microbiota in patients with valvular heart disease: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Gastrointestinal symptoms constitute a frequent complication in postoperative patients with valvular heart disease (VHD), impacting their postoperative recovery. Probiotics contribute to regulating human gut microbiota balance and alleviating postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms. Our objective involved assessing the potential ofsubsp.LPL-RH to alleviate postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms and expedite patient recovery. Adult patients diagnosed with VHD scheduled for valve surgery were enrolled. 110 patients were randomly divided into two groups and received LPL-RH or a placebo for 14 days. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire. An analysis of the time to recovery of bowel function and various postoperative variables was conducted in both study groups. Variations in the intestinal microbiota were detected16S rRNA sequencing. The study was completed by 105 participants, with 53 in the probiotic group and 52 in the placebo group. Compared to the placebo group, LPL-RH significantly reduced the total gastrointestinal symptom score after surgery (= 0.004). Additionally, LPL-RH was found to significantly reduce abdominal pain (= 0.001), bloating (= 0.018), and constipation (= 0.022) symptom scores. Furthermore, LPL-RH dramatically shortened the time to recovery of bowel function (= 0.017). Moreover, LPL-RH administration significantly enhanced patients' postoperative nutrition indexes (red blood cell counts, hemoglobin level,< 0.05). Microbiome analysis showed that the composition and diversity of the postoperative intestinal microbiota differed between the probiotic and placebo groups. No adverse incidents associated with probiotics were documented, emphasizing their safety. This study initially discovered that oralsubsp.LPL-RH can assist in regulating intestinal microbiota balance, alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms, promoting intestinal function recovery, and enhancing nutrition indexes in patients with VHD after surgery. Regulating the intestinal microbiota may represent a potential mechanism for LPL-RH to exert clinical benefits.
