Study Title: Assessment of Acceptability, Usage, and Impact on Caregivers of Children With Autism's Stress and Mindfulness: Multiple-Method Feasibility Study of the 5Minutes4Myself App's Mindfulness Module.

Study Summary:
Caregiver wellness programs need to be easily accessible to address caregivers' constraints to participation. We aimed to assess the feasibility of 5Minutes4Myself app's mindfulness module (usability, usage, and impact on caregivers' levels of mindfulness and perceived stress). Before and after participation in the 5Minutes4Myself program, 15 participants were asked to complete the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Data on the usage of app-delivered meditations were collected electronically via the app, and app usability was rated on the Modified System Usability Scale. Analyses assessed participants' frequency of use of app-delivered meditations, app usability, and changes in participants' stress and mindfulness post intervention. Overall, participants completed 10.9 minutes of mindfulness meditations per week and rated the app 76.7, indicating above-average usability. Related samples t tests (2-tailed) found that group PSS (t10=1.20, P=.26) and FFMQ (t10=-1.57, P=.15) pre- or postintervention mean scores were not significantly different. However, a visualization of pre- and post-PSS and mindfulness scores suggested there was a group of responders who had decreased stress with increased mindfulness. This was confirmed via an individual change analysis. The effect size of the FFMQ scores (d=0.47) suggests there may be treatment effects with a larger sample. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis examined the degree mindfulness impacted perceived stress; 20% of the variance in participants' perceived stress could be attributed to increases in self-rated mindfulness (P=.04) when controlling for preintervention stress levels. Caregivers found the app highly usable and on average used low-dose levels of mindfulness meditations (10 min/wk). For responders, increased mindfulness was related to stress reduction to population-based levels.
