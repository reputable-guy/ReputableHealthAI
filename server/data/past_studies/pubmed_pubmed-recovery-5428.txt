Study Title: Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Post-Stroke Comorbid Cognitive Impairment and Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
There are currently no uniform treatments for post-stroke comorbid cognitive impairment and depression (PSCCID). To verify whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve PSCCID symptoms and explore the underlying roles of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Thirty PSCCID patients were randomized in a 1&#x200a;:&#x200a;1 ratio to receive 4 weeks of rTMS (intervention group) or sham rTMS (control group) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). rs-fMRI was acquired to analyze the functional plasticity of brain regions at baseline and immediately after the last intervention. Cognition, depression status, and neural electrophysiology were improved in both intervention and control groups after treatment (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.015-0.042), and the intervention group had more significant improvement than the control group. Analysis of functional connectivities (FCs) within the default mood network (DMN) showed that the connection strength of the left temporal pole/left parahippocampal cortex and right lateral temporal cortex/right retrosplenial cortex in the intervention group were enhanced compared with its pre-intervention and that in the control group after treatment (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05), and the both FC values were positively correlated with MMSE scores (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001). The intervention group had stronger FCs within the DMN compared with the control group after treatment, and some of the enhanced FCs were correlated with the P300 latency and amplitude. rTMS over the left DLPFC is an effective treatment for improving both cognitive impairment and depression among patients with PSCCID. The enhanced FCs within the DMN may serve as a compensatory functional recombination to promote clinical recovery.
