Study Title: A cultural adaptation of acceptance and commitment therapy with exercise for older Chinese with chronic pain and depressive symptoms: A mixed-methods study.

Study Summary:
Chronic pain and depression are highly prevalent and correlated in older adults. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and exercise have been shown to be effective for both conditions, mostly in Western literature. Little is known about integrating two approaches, particularly in Asian cultures and among less well-educated people. This article describes the iterative process of developing a culturally adapted ACT with exercise intervention for older Chinese with chronic pain and depressive symptoms. A multidisciplinary expert panel codesigned a culturally adapted ACT with exercise intervention, comprising a weekly 2-hr ACT and a 1&#xbd;-hr exercise program for 8 weeks, focusing on six ACT core components and low-to-moderate intensity circuit-based resistance exercise. Its feasibility was tested through a mixed-methods, pretest-posttest design with 22 older Chinese experiencing chronic pain and depressive symptoms (= 71.5 years,= 7.5, 86% female). Participants showed significant improvements in pain intensity, pain interference, pain self-efficacy, physical performance, pain acceptance, and committed action (all< .05). We identified five themes to inform protocol revision: (1) contextualizing values, (2) utilizing experiential learning, (3) using culturally appropriate metaphors, (4) establishing linkage between ACT concepts and pain, and (5) promoting application through repetition and prompts. Incorporating these findings, the final protocol emphasized three core ACT components and one set of physical exercises. This is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of a culturally adapted, person-centered tailoring ACT with exercise intervention for improving pain-related outcomes and mental wellness among older Chinese.
