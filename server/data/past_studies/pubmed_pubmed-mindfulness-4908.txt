Study Title: Mental health benefits of a 1-week intensive multimodal group program for adolescents with multiple adverse childhood experiences.

Study Summary:
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with a wide range of diseases, unsafe behavior and shorter life expectancy. However, there is scarce evidence on effective interventions for children or adolescents who report multiple ACEs, including abuse, neglect and household dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health outcomes of a multimodal program designed for adolescents with multiple ACEs. Forty-four girls (aged 13-16&#xa0;years, mean ACE score&#xa0;>&#xa0;5) were randomized to an intervention group or a care-as-usual control group. The intervention included mindfulness-based practices, expressive arts and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Integrative) group treatment. We used questionnaires for adolescents to assess trauma (SPRINT, CPSS) and attention/awareness-related outcomes (MAAS-A) at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and two-months post-discharge (T3). Linear mixed effects model analyses showed significant Group by Time interactions on all the scales (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;11.0, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.015; F&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.5 p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; and F&#xa0;=&#xa0;6.4, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001, for SPRINT, CPSS and MAAS-A, respectively). After completing the program, the intervention group showed significant reduction in trauma-related outcomes (SPRINT, &#x394;%&#xa0;=&#xa0;-73%, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; CPSS, &#x394;%&#xa0;=&#xa0;-26%, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) while attention/awareness-related outcomes were improved by 57% (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). These changes remained stable two months after discharge. SPRINT and CPSS scales were highly correlated (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.833, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and outcomes from both trauma-related scales negatively correlated with mindfulness scores (MAAS-A/SPRINT, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.515, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007; MAAS-A/CPSS, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.553, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Results presented here support this multimodal group intervention as a feasible and promising program for reducing the psychological burden in adolescents with a history of multiple ACEs.
