Study Title: Ultrasound-Guided Double-Point Versus Single-Point Serratus Anterior Plane Block for Modified Radical Mastectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The double-point serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) covers more area, including the axilla, than the single-point approach, potentially offering better pain relief after modified radical mastectomy (MRM). The objective of this study were to evaluate the clinical outcomes of these 2 procedures for patients treated with MRMs. Sixty women were randomly assigned to double- or single-point groups. Double-point received SAPB at the third and fifth ribs, single-point at the fifth rib. The primary outcome includes pain numeric rating scale (NRS) at rest and movement 24 hours postsurgery. The secondary outcomes are axilla comfort NRS, recovery quality, and adverse events. At 24 hours postsurgery, the double-point group compared with the single-point group showed movement pain NRS of 3 (2 to 3) versus 3 (3 to 4) ( P =0.011) and rest pain NRS of 1 (1 to 1) versus 2 (1 to 3) ( P =0.037). The difference between them did not exceed the minimum clindically important difference (MCID). The axillary comfort NRS in the double-point group was lower than the single-point group at 6 and 12 hours postsurgery, at 1 (1 to 2) versus 2 (2 to 4) ( P =0.001) and 1 (1 to 2) versus 2 (2 to 4) ( P =0.01), respectively, but there were no statistically significant differences at 24 and 48 hours postsurgery. At 48 hours postsurgery, pain scores and opioid use were similar in both groups. Recovery scores, rescue analgesia timing, adverse events, and hospital stay length were similar in both groups. Double-point SAPB offers wider anesthetic spread but shows no significant clinical advantage in pain or axillary comfort over single-point SAPB after MRM.
