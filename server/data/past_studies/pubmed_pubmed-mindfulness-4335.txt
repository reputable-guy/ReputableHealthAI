Study Title: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Reduces Proinflammatory Gene Regulation But Not Systemic Inflammation Among Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Aging is associated with increased proinflammatory gene expression and systemic inflammation, and psychosocial stress may accelerate these changes. Mindfulness interventions show promise for reducing psychosocial stress and extending healthspan. Inflammatory pathways may play a role. In a sample of lonely older adults, we tested whether mindfulness training reduces proinflammatory gene expression and protein markers of systemic inflammation. Lonely older adults (65-85 years; N = 190) were randomly assigned to an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or matched Health Enhancement Program (HEP). Blood was drawn before and after the intervention and at 3-month follow-up. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, RNA profiling was used to assess transcriptional regulation by proinflammatory nuclear factor &#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B) as well as &#x3b2;-adrenergic cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), antiviral interferon regulatory factor (IRF), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription factors. Plasma was assayed for proinflammatory markers interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Analyses tested time (pre, post, follow-up) by condition (MBSR versus HEP) effects. MBSR reduced NF-&#x3ba;B ( d = 0.17, p = .028) but did not alter CREB ( d = 0.10, p = .20), IRF ( d = 0.13, p = .086), or GR activity ( d = 0.14, p = .063) relative to HEP over time. Contrary to predictions, there were no time by condition effects of MBSR compared with HEP on reducing circulating IL-6 or CRP. In lonely older adults, MBSR reduced cellular proinflammatory gene regulation in ways that would predict reduced disease risk. However, no similar effect was observed for circulating protein markers of inflammation. These results provide specificity about how mindfulness interventions may impact distinct inflammatory markers among aging adults in ways that may have important implications for healthspan.
