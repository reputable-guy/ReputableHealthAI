Study Title: Results of a 12-Month Randomized Controlled Trial Testing the Efficacy of the Diabetes Prevention Program Group Lifestyle Balance (DPP-GLB) for People Post Stroke (GLB-CVA).

Study Summary:
Experience of stroke is associated with an increased risk for diabetes and metabolic syndrome, yet few interventions exist that have been tailored to the population's unique needs. To examine adherence and efficacy of the Diabetes Prevention Program Group Lifestyle Balance program (DPP-GLB) modified for individuals post stroke (GLB-CVA) using a randomized controlled trial. Adults (18-85 years of age), >12 months post stroke, and body mass index &#x2265;25 kg/m2 were included in this study. Sixty-five individuals were assigned to either the GLB-CVA intervention or a 6-month wait-list control. Participants completed the 12-month GLB-CVA intervention, with attendance and assessment of weight, anthropometric, biomarker, functional, and patient reported outcome data collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. High attendance (90%) and dietary and activity tracking (71%) suggest high adherence to the 12-month GLB-CVA. Six-month randomized controlled trial data indicate significant weight loss (p = .005) in the GLB-CVA group (7.4 &#xb1; 13.6 lbs, 3.65%) compared with the wait-list control (0.1 &#xb1; 10.1 lbs, 0%), and improvements in arm circumference (p = .04), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p = .028), 8-year diabetes risk (p = .011), and pain interference (p < .001). Combined 12-month data showed participants lost 10.1 &#xb1; 16.8 lbs (4.88%) and improved waist circumference (p = .001), HbA1c (3.6%), diastolic blood pressure (p < .001), pain (p = .001), social participation (p = .025), and eating practices (p = .01) and habits (p < .001). Engagement in the GLB-CVA can result in weight loss and improved health for individuals who are overweight or obese following stroke. Future efforts should examine effectiveness in real-world settings and focus on knowledge translation efforts.
