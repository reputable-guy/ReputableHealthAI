Study Title: Cardiometabolic Risk and Dietary Behaviors in Middle-School Children Consuming School-Sourced Lunch.

Study Summary:
Childhood obesity remains a major public health issue. This study assessed the association between school-sourced lunches and cardiometabolic risk factors in middle-school students. Data from health behavior surveys and physiologic screenings in a Michigan middle-school wellness program between 2005 and 2019 were used to analyze the association of school lunch consumption with cardiometabolic risk factors (overweight/obesity, non-fasting lipids/glucose, blood pressure) and dietary behaviors (fruit/vegetable consumption, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages/foods). Students were divided into three groups based on their responses to the survey item if they 1) always, 2) sometimes, or 3) never consumed school-sourced lunches. Groups were compared using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests. Students consuming school-sourced lunches were more likely to have overweight or obesity, without significant differences in total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol. There was no difference in non-fasting glucose levels, blood pressure, or resting heart rate. Students consuming school sourced lunch were more likely to have increased sugary and fatty food or beverage consumption. Students consuming school sourced lunch were more likely to attend school in a low or middle socioeconomic status region. In this large cohort of middle-school children, consuming school-sourced lunches was associated with a greater prevalence of overweight and obesity and consumption of fatty foods and sugary beverages. School-based interventions should target methods to reduce consumption of sugary beverages and unhealthy snacks and promote consumption of fruits and vegetables, particularly among high-risk individuals.
