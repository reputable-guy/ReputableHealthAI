Study Title: Addition of Dexmedetomidine to the Anesthesia Regimen Attenuates Pain and Improves Early Recovery After Esophageal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Postoperative pain is a common yet often underestimated complication following esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), with limited strategies for effective management. This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of adding dexmedetomidine (DEX) to the anesthesia regimen on postoperative pain and early recovery in patients undergoing esophageal ESD. In total, 60 patients scheduled for elective esophageal ESD under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to the DEX or control group. The DEX group received an intravenous loading dose of DEX at 1&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/kg for 10&#xa0;min, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.6&#xa0;&#xb5;g/kg/h, which was stopped 30&#xa0;min before the end of the procedure. The control group received normal saline as a placebo. The study's primary outcome was the incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain scores, hemodynamic parameters, the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), patient satisfaction, and lengths of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital. The incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain in the DEX group was significantly lower than that in the control group (absolute difference: -33.4%; OR: 0.250; 95% CI: 0.085-0.731,= 0.01). Pain scores at 1&#xa0;h postoperatively (0.5[2.0]3.0[1.3],= 0.003) were significantly lower in the DEX group. Additionally, morphine dosage in the PACU (0[0]1.0[2.0]= 0.004) was significantly reduced in the DEX group compared with the control group. In the DEX group, the incidence and severity of PONV were significantly decreased and the length of PACU stay was shorter than in the control group (0.01). However, the rates of intraoperative hypotension, tachycardia, and bradycardia were similar between the two groups. Patient satisfaction and length of hospital stay were also comparable. Adding DEX to the anesthesia regimen for esophageal ESD significantly attenuates postoperative pain and improves early recovery outcomes.
