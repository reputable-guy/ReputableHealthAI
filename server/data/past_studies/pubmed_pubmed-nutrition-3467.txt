Study Title: Nutrition self-efficacy intervention to improve nutritional status of Iranian older adults.

Study Summary:
Older adults are a vulnerable group that is at risk of poor nutritional status, which can lead to disease and increase their healthcare costs. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of a self-efficacy intervention on the nutritional status of older adults. A controlled before and after study was conducted on 110 older adults in the Mashhad, Iran, from 2020 to 2022. Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55) and control groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55). Participants in the intervention group received educational training that was based on the self-efficacy theory. The control group received the routine care. Data collection tools included demographic information questionnaire, Mini Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire, and standard self-efficacy questionnaire. The questionnaires were completed at baseline (before intervention), instantly after the intervention, and at 3-months follow-up by participants in both groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25 and the significance level was considered less than 0.05. The Mean of nutritional status in the intervention group, at the baseline, immediately after intervention and 3 months of follow-up were 25.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.3, 28.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.2 and 27.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6., respectively. This increase was significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Our findings revealed that self-efficacy among participants in the intervention group significantly changed (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) across time from baseline through follow-up. There was no significant difference in the mean of self-efficacy and nutritional status in the control group during the study period (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). This current study provided a basis to examine in the effectiveness of such intervention using a properly powered randomized controlled study. Therefore, it can be concluded that self-efficacy interventions are a promising approach to improving the nutritional behaviors of the older adults. IRCT20160619028529N9.
