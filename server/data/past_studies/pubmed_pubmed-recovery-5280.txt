Study Title: Preventing Postoperative Catheter-Related Bladder Discomfort (CRBD) with Bladder Irrigation Using 0.05% Lidocaine Saline Solution: Monitoring with Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) after Transurethral Surgery.

Study Summary:
(1): Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD), a common and distressing consequence of indwelling urinary catheters, can significantly impact postoperative recovery. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of bladder irrigation with a 0.05% lidocaine normal saline solution for the prevention of CRBD following transurethral surgery. (2): In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were assigned to either a control group receiving normal saline or a treatment group receiving 0.05% lidocaine (2% lidocaine 25 mL in 1000 mL saline) for bladder irrigation. Both groups were administered fentanyl (1 &#x3bc;g/kg) for analgesia at the end of the procedure. The primary endpoint was the assessment of the incidence and severity of CRBD upon awakening within the first 6 h postoperatively, using a four-grade scale based on the patients' reports of discomfort. (3): Out of 79 patients completing the study, the incidence of moderate to severe CRBD was significantly lower in the lidocaine group (5.1%, 2/39) compared to the control group (25%, 10/40) at 10 min after waking from anesthesia (= 0.014). Furthermore, the lidocaine group experienced significantly less CRBD at 1 and 2 h postoperative (2.6% and 0%, respectively) compared to the control group (20% and 10%, respectively) (= 0.015,= 0.043), with no significant differences at 6 h (= 0.317). (4): The results suggest that bladder irrigation with 0.05% lidocaine reduces the occurrence of moderate to severe CRBD by nearly 80% in the initial 2 h postoperative period after transurethral surgery.
