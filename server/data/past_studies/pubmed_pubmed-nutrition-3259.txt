Study Title: Nutritional Support in Malnourished Outpatients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: The evidence for nutritional support in COPD is almost entirely based on ready-to-drink oral nutritional supplements (ONSs). This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of powdered ONSs alongside individualized dietary counseling in the management of malnutrition. (2) Methods: Malnourished outpatients with COPD were randomized to receive either routine care (Group A: counseling + recommended to purchase powdered ONSs) or an enhanced intervention (Group B: counseling + provision of powdered ONSs at no cost to the patient) for 12 weeks. Outcomes of interest were nutritional intake, weight status, and quality of life. (3) Results: A total of 33 outpatients were included, categorized as follows: Group A (= 21); Group B (= 12); severely malnourished (= 9), moderately malnourished (= 24), mean BMI 18.0 SD 2.5 kg/m. No differences were observed between groups at baseline or at week 12; however, analysis of the whole cohort (Group A + B) revealed nutrition intervention resulted in significant improvements in protein intake (+25.4 SD 53.4 g/d;= 0.040), weight (+1.1 SD 2.6 kg;= 0.032) and quality of life (-4.4 SD 10.0;= 0.040). Only 41.2% of Group A and 58.3% of Group B reported consuming ONSs at week 12. Adherence to ONSs was associated with weight gain (+1.9 SD 2.5 kg vs. +0.4 SD 2.5 kg;= 0.098). (4) Conclusions: Nutritional support results in significant improvements in nutrition status and quality of life in malnourished outpatients with COPD. However, improvements are associated with adherence to ONSs, suggesting the type of ONSs and how they are provided are important considerations in clinical practice and future studies.
