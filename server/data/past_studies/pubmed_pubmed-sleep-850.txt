Study Title: A phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bedtime sublingual cyclobenzaprine (TNX-102 SL) in military-related posttraumatic stress disorder.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbances in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are a potential target for improving PTSD severity with pharmacotherapy. TNX-102 SL is a bedtime sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine with potent binding and antagonist activity at 5-HT, &#x3b1;-adrenergic, Hhistaminergic, and Mmuscarinic receptors, which play roles in the pharmacological management of sleep disturbances. This Phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of TNX-102 SL in patients with military-related PTSD. Early and sustained improvements in sleep were associated with TNX-102 SL treatment by PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) "sleep disturbance" item, establishing a sleep quality benefit. Primary analysis comparing change from baseline in CAPS-5 total severity between TNX-102 SL and placebo at week 12 was not significant; however, week 4 was associated with an improvement. Secondary analyses showed TNX-102 SL treatment was associated with benefits on the Clinician Global Impression of Improvement at week 4 and the Patient Global Impression of Change at week 12. Time since trauma exposure was a discriminator of CAPS-5 treatment response in the subgroup &#x2264; 9 years since the index event. This study provides preliminary evidence that TNX-102 SL is well-tolerated and may promote recovery from PTSD by addressing sleep-related symptoms.
