Study Title: Lifestyle Medicine for the Health Care Worker, Workplace, and Community Well-Being: A Butterfly Effect.

Study Summary:
Description Burnout is a prevalent and expensive problem in the US, and the National Plan For Health Workforce Well-Being included a goal to institutionalize well-being as a long-term value. Lifestyle Medicine (LM), an evidence-based practice using behavioral interventions to treat, prevent, and reverse certain chronic conditions, can achieve this goal. Implementing small changes in the workplace that support lifestyle medicine has a butterfly effect on both workplace and community well-being. Furthermore, the health of health care workers (HCWs) and patients improves, and health care costs decrease. This can be done with LM wellness programs or LM training for HCWs. LM wellness programs help the individual HCWs' and patients' well-being through the implementation of the 6 pillars of lifestyle medicine (nutrition, diet, stress reduction, social connection, avoiding/reducing toxins, restorative sleep) on an institutional level. LM initiatives, like LM training, help HCWs and their patients embark on this journey of optimal well-being, disease prevention, treatment, or reversal. Aligning policies to support evidence-based lifestyle changes that improve mood and stress reduction would support restorative rest, leaving HCWs less drained and allowing for more energy to be spent devoted to other lifestyle pillars. The Lifestyle Medicine Residency Curriculum is an example of an LM training program that leads to successful lifestyle change in residents' lives, improving their ability to coach patients. Finally, health care delivery that supports lifestyle medicine, such as shared medical appointments, is in alignment with the trend towards a value-based system for the improvement of public health.
