Study Title: Scalp Acupuncture Synchronizing Dual Task Gait for Enhancing Prefrontal Cortex Response.

Study Summary:
Studies have shown that motor-cognitive dual task can greatly improve motor/cognitive function. However, the therapeutic effect of motor-cognitive dual task is still limited. How to improve dual-task performance is the key to solving this problem. Scalp acupuncture is a non-drug intervention method of traditional Chinese medicine to treat brain-derived diseases by acupuncturing the corresponding projection area of cerebral cortex function on the scalp. Studies have shown that scalp acupuncture helps improve neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction and plays a neuroprotective function in central nervous system diseases. However, no relevant studies have discussed the synergistic gain effect of motor-cognitive dual task and scalp acupuncture. Therefore, this protocol aims to demonstrate the standardized operation of scalp acupuncture synchronizing motor-cognitive dual task and motor-cognitive dual task and compares the differences between these two tasks in healthy subjects through a randomized cross-over trial. This protocol initially revealed the possible influence mechanism of scalp acupuncture synchronizing motor-cognitive dual task on cognitive performance, gait control, and cortical brain function, which can provide new ideas and a theoretical basis for clinical exploration of new and effective non-drug treatment of integrated Chinese and Western medicine.
