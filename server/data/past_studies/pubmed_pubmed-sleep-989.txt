Study Title: Motor cortex transcranial direct current stimulation improves non-motor symptoms in early-onset Parkinson's disease: a pilot study.

Study Summary:
Early-onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD) demands tailored treatments. The younger age of patients might account for a higher sensitivity to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) based non-invasive neuromodulation, which may raise as an integrative therapy in the field. Accordingly, here we&#xa0;assessed the safety and efficacy of the primary left motor cortex (M1) anodal tDCS in EOPD. Ten idiopathic EOPD patients received tDCS at 2.0&#xa0;mA per 20&#xa0;min for 10&#xa0;days within a crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study. The outcome was evaluated by measuring changes in MDS-UPDRS part III, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), PD-cognitive rating scale, and PD Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 scores. We showed that&#xa0;anodal but not sham tDCS significantly reduced the NMSS total and "item 2" (sleep/fatigue) scores. Other parameters were not modified. No adverse events occurred. M1 anodal tDCS might thus&#xa0;evoke plasticity changes in cortical-subcortical circuits involved in non-motor functions, supporting the value as a therapeutic option in EOPD.
