Study Title: Effects of multi-task training on motor and cognitive performances in multiple sclerosis patients without clinical disability: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effects of multi-task training on motor and cognitive performance in People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) without clinical disability compared to single-task training and a control group. A total of 42 patients were randomly assigned to three groups labeled as Multi-Task Training Group (MTTG, n:14), Single-Task Training Group (STTG, n:14), and Control Group (CG, n:14). The STTG performed only motor tasks based on the task-oriented training program twice a week for 6&#xa0;weeks while the MTTG performed the same tasks concurrently with additional motor and cognitive tasks. The CG performed relaxation exercises at home. Postural stability by posturography, walking by Timed Up-and-Go, manual dexterity by Nine-Hole Peg Test, mental tracking by Counting Backward, and verbal fluency by Word List Generation were assessed before and after the intervention under single and dual-task conditions. In the MTTG, both single cognitive and single motor task performances increased, and, moreover, the cognitive Dual-Task Costs (DTCs) decreased although the motor DTCs were not changed significantly. There were significant group-by-time interactions in favor of MTTG only on the mental tracking DTC during walking compared to the STTG. Moreover, the changes in postural and walking DTCs were associated with changes in single-motor task performance. This study suggests that multi-task training is effective in reducing cognitive DTC rather than motor DTC under dual-task conditions in PwMS without clinical disability. NCT03512886.
