Study Title: Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has no impact on postpartum transient longitudinal changes in hip geometry in adolescent mothers: a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
We have previously demonstrated that calcium plus vitamin D supplementation during adolescent pregnancy reduces the magnitude of transient postpartum bone mass loss. In the present post hoc analysis, we further investigated the effect of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in hip geometry throughout one year postpartum in Brazilian adolescents with low daily calcium intake (&#x223c;600 mg/d). Pregnant adolescents (14-19 years) were randomly assigned to receive calcium (600 mg/d) plus vitamin D(200 &#x3bc;g/d) or a placebo from 26 weeks of gestation until parturition. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry images were obtained at 5 (30 and 26 for calcium plus vitamin D and placebo, respectively), 20 (26 and 21) and 56 (18 and 12) weeks postpartum, and hip geometry parameters were analysed by Advanced Hip Assessment software. The effects of the intervention, time point and their interaction were assessed using repeated-measures mixed-effects models. No significant intervention effects or intervention &#xd7; time interactions were observed on hip geometry parameters (> 0&#xb7;05). Time effects were observed in cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia and section modulus parameters with decreases from the 5th to the 20th week postpartum followed by recovery from the 20th to the 56th week (< 0&#xb7;05). Our findings indicate that the postpartum period is associated with transient changes in the hip geometry of lactating adolescent mothers, regardless of the low calcium intake and the supplementation offered during pregnancy, suggesting that a physiological adaptation of these adolescents to low calcium intake is at play.
