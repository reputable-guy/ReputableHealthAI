Study Title: A 2-Year Longitudinal Randomized Control Trial of Speed of Processing Cognitive Training in Aging Adults with HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder: Results of the Think Fast Study.

Study Summary:
Nearly 40% of people with HIV (PWH) experience HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). In this 3-group efficacy study, 216 PWH 40&#x2009;+&#x2009;years with HAND or borderline HAND were randomized to either: (1) 10&#xa0;h of SOP training (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;70); (2) 20&#xa0;h of SOP training (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;73), or (3) 10&#xa0;h of Internet navigation training (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;73; contact control group). Participants were administered a measure of SOP [i.e., the Useful Field of View Test (UFOV&#xae;)] at baseline, at posttest immediately after training, and at year 1 and year 2 follow up. Intent-to-treat linear mixed-effect models with subject-specific intercept and slope were fitted to estimate between-group mean differences at the follow-up time-points. At the post-intervention time-point, small beneficial SOP training effects were observed for the 10-h group in UFOV&#xae; total (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Effects were of larger magnitude for the 20-h group in these same outcomes [UFOV&#xae; total (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001)]. These results indicated better benefit with more training. No intervention effect was observed at year 1. At year 2, beneficial effects of small magnitude were observed again in the 10-h group [UFOV&#xae; total (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.253)] with larger small-to-moderate magnitude in the 20-h group [UFOV&#xae; total (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.104)]. This study suggests that SOP training can improve a key indicator of this cognitive performance and that treatment gains are small-to-moderate over a two-year period. Prior literature suggests slower SOP is predictive of impairment in everyday functioning in older PWH; such an approach could potentially improve everyday functioning in PWH.
