Study Title: Clinical effect of perioperative stellate ganglion block on mechanical ventilation and respiratory function of elderly patients with septic shock.

Study Summary:
Here we investigated the effect of a stellate ganglion block on the perioperative mechanical ventilation and postoperative recovery of respiratory function of elderly patients with infectious shock. Thirty-six elderly patients with septic shock who underwent emergency general anesthesia at our hospital were randomly divided into treatment (T) and control (C) groups (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;18 each). Group T received a preoperative stellate ganglion block, whereas group C received normal saline. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels were compared preoperatively and at 1 and 7 days postoperative. Mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, and mean pulmonary artery pressure were measured preoperative and postoperative as well as at 1 and 7 days later. A blood gas analysis was performed preoperatively, at the end of the operation, during extubation, and at 1 and 7 days postoperative. Intubation under general anesthesia, the completion of anesthesia, and spontaneous respiratory recovery involve pulmonary dynamic compliance, plateau pressure, and mechanical ventilation. General condition did not differ significantly between groups (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). However, mean arterial pressure at the end of surgery and at 1 and 7 days postoperative were significantly higher in group T versus C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Furthermore, mean oxygen saturation at the end of surgery and at 1 and 7 days postoperative was significantly lower in group T versus C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05), while procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower at 1 and 7 days postoperative. Group T had significantly better arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen than group C at the end of surgery, during extubation, and at 1 and 7 days postoperative (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Group T exhibited superior inflammatory responses and respiratory function. Stellate ganglion block in elderly patients with septic shock reduces inflammation, improves mechanical ventilation perioperatively, and promotes postoperative recovery and respiratory function.
