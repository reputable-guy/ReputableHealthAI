Study Title: Reducing parenting stress in Chinese parents of children with learning disabilities with a mindful parenting program: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Parents raising children with Learning Disabilities (LDs) often face multiple challenges and high levels of parenting stress, especially in societies with intense academic competitions. Mindful parenting (MP) is an emerging approach that brings mindful awareness to parent-child interactions and is found effective in reducing parenting stress in various parent populations. This study examined the effectivenesss of an 8-week online MP program on Chinese parents of children with LDs. A MP program was adapted and implemented in an online format with 69 parents of children with LDs. A randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the efficacy of the mindful parenting group compared with a wait-list control group. Parenting stress, mindful parenting and self-compassion were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Compared with the wait-list control group, the MP group participants showed decreased parenting stress (d = 0.62, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), improved mindful parenting (d = 0.63, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), and increased self-compassion (d = 0.61, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). These findings support the effectiveness of an online MP intervention in reducing parenting stress and increasing mindful parenting and self-compassion among Chinese parents of children with LDs. The behavioral and intrapersonal aspects of MP are more amenable to improvement, whereas the attitudinal and interpersonal aspects, particularly non-judgmental acceptance and compassion towards the child, are resistant to change. Future studies should explore strategies to enhance these attitudinal aspects and interpersonal processes of MP.
