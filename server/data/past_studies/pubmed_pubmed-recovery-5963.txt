Study Title: Comparison of the effects of ring block and dorsal penile nerve block on parental satisfaction for circumcision operation in children: randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
In children, circumcision is a procedure associated with perioperative pain and parental satisfaction is an important parameter in the evaluation of anesthesia procedures. Inadequate dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) for the ventral shaft of the penis might impact parental satisfaction negatively. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared the effects of penile ring block (RB) and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) on parental satisfaction. Postoperative pain, need for additional analgesia, intraoperative hemodynamic data, recovery status, side effects, and postoperative complications were evaluated as secondary outcomes between the blocks. Parental satisfaction and anesthetic effectiveness of RB and DPNB for circumcision in children were compared. 86 patients were randomized 1:1 to Group RB and Group DPNB, which were administered the same dose of anesthesia. Parental satisfaction was evaluated with the Pediatric Anesthesia Parental Satisfaction Questionnaire (PAPS). Postoperative pain evaluations were made with the Face, Legs, Activity, Crying, Consolability Pain Scale (FLACC). In terms of parent satisfaction, no differences were detected between the groups in the pre-anesthesia, pre-anesthesia and post-anesthesia, post-anesthesia, hospital team, and anesthesia team parameters (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The scores of Group DPNB patients were higher only in the "Q11" subparameter in the "anesthesia team" parameter, and this difference was significant (0.024). RB and DPNB were compared in circumcision, which is the most common surgical procedure for children. Parental satisfaction, anesthesia, and analgesic effects of both blocks were found to be similar.
