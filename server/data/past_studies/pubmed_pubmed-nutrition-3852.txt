Study Title: Effectiveness of a text-messaging intervention on intuitive eating: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Intuitive eating (IE) is a concept based on mind-body integration of instinct, emotion and rational thought, to improve eating behaviours, physical and mental health. Several attempts were developed to teach IE principles including text-messaging interventions given that they are easy to implement and low cost. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a 5-week text message-based IE intervention on IE, while correcting for perceived stress (PS) and self-compassion (SC). A randomised controlled trial. Online, in Lebanon. Adults (195) were randomised into one of three groups: the active IE group receiving IE-related messages with a practice exercise, the passive IE group receiving only IE-related messages and the control group receiving general health-related tips. Ten messages were delivered over 5 weeks. Two follow-ups were made: directly post-intervention and 7 weeks later. Baseline data and follow-ups included demographics, nutrition-related variables and measures of IE, SC and PS. Results indicated improvements in IE scores in the two intervention groups (= 0&#xb7;05), with the passive IE group showing the most improvement. Also, a significant improvement in SC (&#x39b; = 0&#xb7;88, F (2, 63) = 4&#xb7;40,= 0&#xb7;01) and reduction in PS (&#x39b; = 0&#xb7;86, F (2, 63) = 5&#xb7;21,= 0&#xb7;008) were observed in the active IE group. Text-messaging interventions might be efficient in enhancing IE. Results shed light on the need for further large-scale interventions that use visual aids and provide practical guidance to teach IE, while further characterising the relation between IE, SC and stress.
