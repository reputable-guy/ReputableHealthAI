Study Title: Incorporating biofeedback into the Mindfulness in Motion Intervention for health care professionals: Impact on sleep and stress.

Study Summary:
Health care providers (HCP) experience high stress and burnout rates. Mindfulness Based Interventions (MBI) with biofeedback may help improve resiliency but require further research. Aims were to evaluate changes in sleep patterns, nocturnal physiology, stress, mood disturbances, and perceived experience with biofeedback during the Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) intervention. Data from 66 HCP were included after removing those below 75 % compliance with wearable sensors and wellness surveys. Participants were enrolled in MIM, including eight weekly one-hour virtually delivered synchronous group meetings and &#x223c;10 min of mindfulness home practice at least 3 times per week using a mobile application. Participants wore wearable sensors to monitor sleep and nocturnal physiology and completed short daily stress and mood disturbances. According to mixed effect models, no sleep nor physiological metrics changed across MIM (p > 0.05). More time was spent in bed after MIM sessions (8.33&#xb1;1.03 h) compared to night before (8.05&#xb1;0.93 h; p = 0.040). Heart rate variability was lower nights after MIM (33.00&#xb1;15.59 ms) compared to nights before (34.50&#xb1;17.04 ms; p = 0.004) but was not clinically meaningful (effect= 0.033). Significant reductions were noted in perceived stress at weeks 3 through 8 compared to Baseline and lower Total Mood Disturbance at weeks 3, 5, 6, and 8 compared to Baseline (p < 0.001). Participating in the MIM with mobile applications and wearable sensors reduced perceived stress and mood disturbances but did not induce physiological changes. Additional research is warranted to further evaluate objective physiological outcomes while controlling for confounding variables (e.g., alcohol, medications).
