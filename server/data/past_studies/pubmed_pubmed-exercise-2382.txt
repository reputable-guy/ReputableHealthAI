Study Title: The effect of aerobic and high-intensity interval training on plasma pentraxin 3 and lipid parameters in overweight and obese women.

Study Summary:
It is unclear whether different exercise programs lead to an increase in the concentration of plasma Pentraxin3 (PTX3), an anti-inflammatory protein. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise (AE) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on plasma PTX3 levels in overweight and obese women. A total of 45 sedentary women aged between 32.26 &#xb1; 6.30 voluntarily participated in the study. The control group (CG,&#xa0;=&#xa0;15) was selected among normal-weight women. Women in the group of participants who partook in exercise consisted of overweight and obese women according to a random method, including the AE group (&#xa0;=&#xa0;15) and the HIIT group (&#xa0;=&#xa0;15). The AE session conducted was 50 min in duration and consisted of warm-up exercises (5 min), and primary exercises (40 min, basic aerobic-step exercises). HIIT consists of warm-up exercises (5 min), primary exercises (work intervals: 6-10 &#xd7; 1 min (80-90% HRmax), rest intervals: 1 min (walk, 50% HRmax), 21-29 min running. The exercises were applied for three sessions/week for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken from all participants before and after exercise and their body composition was measured. As a result of two different 12-week exercises, serum PTX3 levels increased significantly by 47.53% in the AE group and 50.21% in the HIIT group (&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). It was determined that the mean PTX3 before and after exercise increased from 1.71 &#xb1; 0.43 to 2.47 &#xb1; 0.40 ng/dL and HIIT from 1.62 &#xb1; 0.39 to 2.31 &#xb1; 0.33 ng/dL. A significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) values were detected, approximately 5.81% in the AE group and 5.06% in the HIIT group (&#xa0;<&#xa0;.01). A significant decrease was detected in glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-C, and hsCRP whereas HDL-C and VOvalue increased significantly in both exercise groups (&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05;&#xa0;<&#xa0;.01). There were no significant differences in TG and TC levels between groups (&#xa0;>&#xa0;.05). Also, no significant differences were found between the two types of exercises in terms of parameters. A significant negative correlation in the total sample was found between PTX3 with BMI, fat mass, LDL-C, and hsCRP. The percentage change in PTX3 values was not different between exercise types, whereas PTX3 was increased with exercise, regardless of the type of exercise. It can be said that both aerobic and HIIT increase PTX3, VOlevels and improve lipid metabolism in overweight and obese women.
