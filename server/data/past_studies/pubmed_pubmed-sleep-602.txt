Study Title: Exogenous melatonin's effect on salivary cortisol and amylase: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to examine the effect of acute exogenous melatonin administration on salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sCort and sAA) as representatives of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, respectively. A single-dose prolonged-release melatonin (2&#x2009;mg) or a placebo tablet was given to healthy volunteers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;64) at 20:00&#x2009;h in a crossover design. The saliva was collected at six time points (20:00, 21:00, awakening, 30&#x2009;min after awakening, 10:00, and 12:00&#x2009;h) and was measured for sCort, sAA, and salivary melatonin (sMT) levels. Pulse rates and sleep parameters were also collected. Melatonin was effective in improving sleep onset latency by 7:04&#x2009;min (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.037) and increasing total sleep time by 24&#x2009;min (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.006). Participants with poor baseline sleep quality responded more strongly to melatonin than participants with normal baseline sleep quality as they reported more satisfaction in having adequate sleep (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.017). Melatonin administration resulted in higher sCort levels at awakening time point (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.023) and a tendency of lower sAA levels but these were not significant. Melatonin ingestion at 20:00&#x2009;h resulted in a marked increase in sMT levels at 21:00&#x2009;h and remained higher than baseline up to at least 10:00&#x2009;h (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). Melatonin increases sCort levels at certain time point with a tendency to lower sAA levels. These opposing effects of melatonin suggested a complex interplay between melatonin and these biomarkers. Also, the results confirmed the positive acute effect of a single-dose melatonin on sleep quality.
