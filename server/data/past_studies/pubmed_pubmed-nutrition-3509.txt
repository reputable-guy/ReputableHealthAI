Study Title: An exploratory study of clinical factors associated with IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in preterm infants.

Study Summary:
Despite advances in parenteral nutrition, postnatal growth failure in very low birthweight (VLBW) preterm infants is common and associated with chronic health problems. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is positively associated with improved infant growth, but factors which promote IGF-1 levels in this population have not been clearly identified. The objective of this study was to explore early factors that influence IGF-1 in VLBW preterm infants. VLBW infants were enrolled into a prospective, randomized controlled nutrition trial (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;87). Outcome measures included IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels measured at 35 weeks PMA. Linear regression analyses tested the relationships between candidate clinical predictors and levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. Higher protein intake, longer duration of parenteral nutrition, and lower IGFBP-3 levels at 1 week of life were associated with lower IGF-1 levels at 35 weeks PMA. Neither early markers of insulin resistance nor degree of illness were associated with IGF-1 levels at 35 weeks PMA. Optimization of early nutrient intake, and attention to route of delivery, may have a lasting influence on IGF-1/IGFBP-3, and in turn, long-term health outcomes. In very low birthweight preterm infants, early protein intake, duration of parenteral nutrition, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels at 1 week of life are positively associated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels at 35 weeks postmenstrual age. Data from this study highlight the influence of early nutrition on components of the endocrine axis in preterm infants. Strategies aimed at early initiation of enteral nutrition, as well as optimizing composition of parenteral nutrition, may bolster hormones involved in promoting preterm infant growth.
