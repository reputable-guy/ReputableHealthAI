Study Title: Emerging Technologies and Open-Source Platforms for Remote Physical Exercise: Innovations and Opportunities for Healthy Population-A Narrative Review.

Study Summary:
The emergence of tele-exercise as a response to the impact of technology on physical activity has opened up new possibilities for promoting physical health. By integrating innovative technologies and open-source platforms, tele-exercise encourages people to stay active. In our latest analysis, we delved into the scientific literature surrounding the use of tele-exercise technologies in training healthy individuals. After conducting an extensive search on the PubMed database using the keywords "tele-exercise" and "physical activity" (from 2020 to 2023), we identified 44 clinical trials that were applicable to tele-exercise, but less than 10% of them were aimed at healthy individuals, precisely 9.09% (four out of forty-four studies analyzed). Our review highlights the potential of tele-exercise to help maintain physical fitness and psychological well-being, especially when traditional fitness facilities are not an option. We also underscore the importance of interoperability, standardization, and the incorporation of biomechanics, exercise physiology, and neuroscience into the development of tele-exercise platforms. Nevertheless, despite these promising benefits, research has shown that there is still a significant gap in the knowledge concerning the definition and evaluation of training parameters for healthy individuals. As a result, we call for further research to establish evidence-based practices for tele-exercise in the healthy population.
