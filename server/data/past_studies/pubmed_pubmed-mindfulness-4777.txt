Study Title: A pragmatic preference trial of therapeutic yoga as an adjunct to group cognitive behaviour therapy versus group CBT alone for depression and anxiety.

Study Summary:
Yoga has several mechanisms that make it a promising treatment for depression and anxiety, including physical activity, behavioural activation, and mindfulness. Following positive outcomes from adapted CBT interventions incorporating mindfulness-based practices, this study explored the effects of a therapeutic yoga program as an adjunct to group-based CBT for depression or anxiety. This was a pragmatic preference trial involving adults diagnosed with depression or anxiety in a regional primary mental healthcare service (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;59), comparing transdiagnostic group CBT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27) with transdiagnostic group CBT combined with an adjunct therapeutic yoga program (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32). A preference recruitment design allowed eligible participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;35) to self-select into the adjunct program. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS) was assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and three-months follow up. CBT&#xa0;+&#xa0;Yoga was an acceptable alternative to CBT alone. Significant reductions were observed in total DASS scores and the 3 subscales of the DASS for both groups, however CBT&#xa0;+&#xa0;Yoga showed significantly lower depressive and anxiety symptoms post-intervention, compared to CBT alone. CBT&#xa0;+&#xa0;Yoga also showed sustained reductions in depressive symptoms over three-months, and more rapid reductions in depressive symptoms, compared to CBT alone. These findings should be considered preliminary due to the moderate sample size, with a rigorous randomised control trial necessary to definitively support the integration of yoga within mental health care to augment the benefits and uptake of transdiagnostic CBT for depression and anxiety. Complementing other mindfulness-based practices, therapeutic yoga shows promise as an adjunct to transdiagnostic CBT.
