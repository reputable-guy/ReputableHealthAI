Study Title: Comparison of Ultrasound-guided Single-injection Erector Spinae Plane Block, Retrolaminar Block, and Paravertebral Block for Postoperative Analgesia in Single-incision Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery: A 3-arm, Double-blind, Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial.

Study Summary:
Effective postoperative analgesia is critical for thoracic surgery. This study compares the analgesic efficacy of the erector spinae plane block (ESPB), retrolaminar block (RLB), and paravertebral block (TPVB) in single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SITS). Seventy-six patients underwent general anesthesia followed by ultrasound-guided nerve blocks with 20&#xa0;mL of 0.5% ropivacaine. Primary outcomes included the area under the curve (AUC) of numeric rating scale (NRS) scores during rest and coughing over 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included perioperative opioid use, plasma biomarkers, and postoperative recovery measures. The AUC for NRS was 107.8&#xb1;10.53 in the ESPB group, 104.8&#xb1;8.05 in the RLB group, and 103.6&#xb1;10.42 in the TPVB group, demonstrating noninferiority for ESPB (difference: 4.2&#xb1;3.0, 95% CI: -1.82 to 10.22) and RLB (difference: 1.2&#xb1;2.6, 95% CI: -3.97 to 6.37) compared with TPVB. No statistically significant differences were observed in opioid use, plasma biomarkers, QoR-15 scores, or adverse events. ESPB and RLB provide noninferior analgesia compared with TPVB in SITS patients and are effective alternatives that enhance safety.
