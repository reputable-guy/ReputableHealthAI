Study Title: Clinical nursing application of parenteral nutrition combined with enteral nutrition support in neurosurgery.

Study Summary:
To explore the clinical nursing effect of parenteral nutrition combined with enteral nutrition support in neurosurgery. 200 neurosurgical patients were randomly divided into two groups. The time of parenteral nutrition combined with enteral nutrition support in our hospital (January 2021) was used as the cut-off point, the PN group and the PN+EN group were divided according to the cut-off point. Nutritional status, immune status, occurrence of adverse events, prognosis-related indicators were compared between the two groups. Nutritional status and immune status at 7 days of nutritional support in the PN+EN group were higher than those in the PN group, The difference was statistically significant. The total incidence of adverse events in the PN+EN group (3.00%) was significantly lower than that in the PN group (11.00%), and the difference was statistically significant. The average ICU treatment time, average hospital stay and emerging infection rate in the PN+EN group were lower than those in the PN group, and the differences were statistically significant (< 0.05). Parenteral nutrition combined with enteral nutrition support in neurosurgery can achieve a more ideal intervention effect. It is beneficial to the prognosis of patients and has a certain value of promotion and application.
