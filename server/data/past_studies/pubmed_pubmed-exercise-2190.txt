Study Title: Sexuality in Older Adults: Comprehensive Strategies for Clinicians and Patient-Centered Care.

Study Summary:
Healthcare providers play a crucial role in promoting sexual health among older adults, an important yet often neglected aspect of aging well. Although sexuality evolves beyond the reproductive years, it remains a meaningful part of life for many. Despite the natural decline in sexual activity with age, numerous older adults continue to value and engage in fulfilling sexual relationships. Unfortunately, targeted interventions to support later-life sexuality are lacking, creating gaps in care. Sexuality in older adults is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. Clinicians should include comprehensive sexual health assessments, including STI screenings, as part of routine care. Providing age-appropriate sexual education and resources helps promote lifelong sexual wellness. Open communication between healthcare providers and patients is vital for addressing sexual concerns, often left unspoken due to stigma or discomfort. Additionally, adopting lifestyle medicine principles-such as balanced nutrition, regular exercise, stress management, and social connection-can enhance sexual health and overall well-being. Specialized training for healthcare professionals on the unique aspects of older adult sexuality is essential to bridge knowledge gaps. A holistic, evidence-based approach will empower providers to better support the evolving sexual health needs of older adults, improving their quality of life.
