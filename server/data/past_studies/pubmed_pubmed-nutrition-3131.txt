Study Title: Comparative Analysis of Nutritional Advice and a Combined Approach for Addressing Impending Stunting in Infants: A Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Weight faltering (WF) has been associated with stunting and with long-term adverse consequences for health and development. Nutritional care for managing WF may consist of giving nutritional advice (NA) and/or provision of oral nutrition supplements (ONSs). In this study, we aimed to evaluate practical management options in the community for infants with WF aged 6-12 months. This nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted in the community of Makassar, South Sulawesi, from March 2022 to March 2023. A total of 1013 infants were enrolled for screening. Anthropometric measures were performed in 913 infants, of which 170 showed WF below the 15th percentile of the WHO weight increment table without stunting. Infants with a weight increment below P5th were assigned to receive NA plus ONS, while infants between P5th and below P15th were assigned to receive only NA. At the second and third months, ONSs were administered to WF infants who were below P15th. One month after the intervention, 87/105 infants in the NA-plus-ONS group (82.8%) and 52/65 infants in the NA-only group (80%) were no longer WF. After 3 months, infants in the NA-plus-ONS group achieved greater weight gain than infants in the NA group (264.1 g vs. 137.4 g,< 0.001) as well as greater length gain (2.35 cm vs. 2.14 cm,< 0.001). WF management should be started at below P15th to achieve a better result. Infants with greater nutritional deficits should be assigned to receive the combination of NA plus ONSs to achieve a higher rate of resolution of growth.
