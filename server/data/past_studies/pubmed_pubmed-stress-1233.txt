Study Title: Pelvic Binder Radiography Is Safe and Feasible for Quantifying Fracture Instability in LC1 Pelvis Fractures: A Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
To demonstrate fracture displacement, patient tolerance, and in-hospital safety quantifying lateral compression type 1 (LC1) pelvis fracture stability with awake stress radiography using a pelvic binder (PBR). Prospective clinical trial of PBR diagnostic intervention. Two centers, Level I trauma center and academic hospital. Alert adults with LC1 (OTA/AO B1.1/2.1) pelvic fractures from blunt mechanism presenting within 3 weeks of injury between February and December 2023 without hypotension or injury precluding pelvic binder application. The primary outcome was fracture displacement on PBR. Secondary outcomes included feasibility (&#x2265;85% patient tolerance) and safety (no major adverse events). Exploratory outcomes included pain during examination, opioid medication consumption within 96 hours, length of hospital stay, discharge destination, and correlation between fracture displacement on PBR and examination under anesthetic. One hundred sixty-nine patients with pelvis fractures were screened, 58 were eligible, and 31 were enrolled. The mean age of enrolled patients was 58.7 &#xb1; 23 years, 54.8% were female, 22.6% were White, and 67.7% Hispanic. Fracture displacement was 4.3 &#xb1; 4.7 mm on PBR at 5 kg and 8.4 &#xb1; 9.0 mm at 10 kg. All patients tolerated PBR. Sixteen patients (52%) reported pain during PBR but completed the test. No patient experienced an adverse event. Patients received 40.4 &#xb1; 56.4 mg oral morphine equivalents within 96 hours of PBR. Ten patients (32.2%) received internal fixation. The median hospital stay was 6 days (interquartile range 5.5 days) with no inpatient mortality. Fourteen patients (45.2%) discharged home. PBR is feasible and safe as a point-of-care test for LC1 pelvis fracture instability. Level II Diagnostic.
