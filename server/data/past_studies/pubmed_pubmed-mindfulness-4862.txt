Study Title: Non-pharmacologic interventions to improve depression and anxiety among pregnant and parenting women who use substances: An integrative literature review.

Study Summary:
Pregnant and parenting women who use substances report high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety. Due to the significant impact of this comorbidity on treatment adherence and maternal/child outcomes, effective psychosocial and behavioral interventions to address depression and anxiety in this population are necessary. A directed search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases produced 22 articles from 20 distinct studies examining non-pharmacologic interventions with an effect on depression and anxiety among pregnant or parenting women using substances. Of the 20 studies reviewed, 8 were randomized controlled trials, 7 were quasi-experimental studies, and 5 were cohort studies. Results revealed a wide array of interventions targeting intrapersonal, interpersonal, and/or structural factors within these women's lives. Parenting therapy and psychosocially enhanced treatment programs had the strongest evidence for positive treatment effect in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety. The use of contingency-management, case-managed care, patient or wellness navigators, mindfulness-based therapy, maternal-child relationship-focused therapy, family therapy, peer support, and therapeutic community-based interventions show promise but warrant further experimental exploration. Comprehensive and gender-specific residential treatment was observationally associated with improvements in depression and anxiety; however, the specific modality of efficacy is unclear. Future research should focus on identifying which modalities are most cost-effective, feasible, and acceptable among this uniquely vulnerable population.
