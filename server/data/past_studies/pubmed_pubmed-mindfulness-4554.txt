Study Title: Pilot randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based relapse prevention vs cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking and alcohol use.

Study Summary:
The combined use of cigarettes and alcohol is associated with a synergistic increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality. Continued alcohol use during a smoking quit attempt is a considerable risk factor for smoking relapse. As such, there is a need for interventions that address both behaviors concurrently. Mindfulness-based interventions hold much promise for simultaneously addressing tobacco and alcohol use. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness-based intervention using a two-arm randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention for Smoking and Alcohol (MBRP-SA) vs Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Interventions were delivered via telehealth in a group setting; all participants received a 6-week supply of the nicotine patch. Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;69) were adults who smoked cigarettes who reported binge drinking and were motivated to both quit smoking and change their alcohol use. Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of MBRP-SA compared to CBT. Changes in tobacco and alcohol use are also presented. Participants in MBRP-SA and CBT indicated that the treatments were highly acceptable, meeting a priori benchmarks. Feasibility was mixed with some outcomes meeting benchmarks (e.g., recruitment) and others falling below (e.g., retention). Participants in both conditions demonstrated significant reductions in tobacco and alcohol use at the end of treatment. In sum, MBRP-SA had comparable outcomes to CBT on all metrics measured. Future research should evaluate the efficacy of MBRP-SA on smoking abstinence and drinking reductions in a large-scale, fully powered trial. This study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03734666).
