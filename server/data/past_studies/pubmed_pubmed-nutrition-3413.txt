Study Title: A ketone monoester drink reduces postprandial blood glucose concentrations in adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of the present study was to conduct a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial to determine whether pre-meal ketone monoester ingestion reduces postprandial glucose concentrations in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study, ten participants with type 2 diabetes (age 59&#xb1;1.7 years, 50% female, BMI 32&#xb1;1 kg/m, HbA54&#xb1;2 mmol/mol [7.1&#xb1;0.2%]) were randomised using computer-generated random numbers. The study took place at the Nutritional Physiology Research Unit, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK. Using a dual-glucose tracer approach, we assessed glucose kinetics after the ingestion of a 0.5 g/kg body mass ketone monoester (KME) or a taste-matched non-caloric placebo before a mixed-meal tolerance test. The primary outcome measure was endogenous glucose production. Secondary outcome measures were total glucose appearance rate and exogenous glucose appearance rate, glucose disappearance rate, blood glucose, serum insulin, &#x3b2;-OHB and NEFA levels, and energy expenditure. Data for all ten participants were analysed. KME ingestion increased mean &#xb1; SEM plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate from 0.3&#xb1;0.03 mmol/l to a peak of 4.3&#xb1;1.2 mmol/l while reducing 2 h postprandial glucose concentrations by ~18% and 4 h postprandial glucose concentrations by ~12%, predominately as a result of a 28% decrease in the 2 h rate of glucose appearance following meal ingestion (all p<0.05). The reduction in blood glucose concentrations was associated with suppressed plasma NEFA concentrations after KME ingestion, with no difference in plasma insulin concentrations between the control and KME conditions. Postprandial endogenous glucose production was unaffected by KME ingestion (mean &#xb1; SEM 0.76&#xb1;0.15 and 0.88&#xb1;0.10 mg kgminfor the control and KME, respectively). No adverse effects of KME ingestion were observed. KME ingestion appears to delay glucose absorption in adults with type 2 diabetes, thereby reducing postprandial glucose concentrations. Future work to explore the therapeutic potential of KME supplementation in type 2 diabetes is warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05518448.
