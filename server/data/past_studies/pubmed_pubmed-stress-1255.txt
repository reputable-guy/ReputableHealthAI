Study Title: Oxytocin moderates fMRI connectivity and response to implicit threat processing in cocaine use disorder.

Study Summary:
Stressful social experiences play an important role in increasing vulnerability to substance use, including cocaine. Oxytocin (OXT), known for its anxiolytic properties and involvement in social functioning, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic for cocaine use disorder (CUD). However, limited research has explored OXT's influence on social stress in CUD, and no study has examined its effects on neural response to subconscious (implicit) social threat cues in this population. To address this gap, the present study administered intranasal OXT (24 IU) or placebo (PBO) to participants with CUD (CUD+, N = 76) or without CUD (CUD-, N = 61) in a randomized parallel design. Participants then completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task involving briefly presented facial fear and anger (i.e., threat) cues, followed by neutral face stimuli. Whole-brain activation and amygdala functional connectivity (using psychophysiological interaction modeling) were examined in response to the facial threat cues. OXT reduced activation in the thalamus and pontine reticular formation in response to fear cues, and in the supplementary motor area for both fear and anger cues, regardless of CUD status. Additionally, under PBO, amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity to fear stimuli was negative for the CUD+ group, but under OXT, this coupling was positive, similar to the positive coupling observed for the CUD- group under both PBO and OXT administration. The finding of OXT-mediated reversal of amygdala-prefrontal coupling was specific to CUD+ and suggests that OXT alters circuitry related to threat surveillance and implicit emotion regulation in CUD. However, additional research is needed to determine whether these alterations due to OXT have clinical significance in CUD.
