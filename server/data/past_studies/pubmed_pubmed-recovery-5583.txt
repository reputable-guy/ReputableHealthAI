Study Title: Application of dezocine patient-controlled epidural analgesia in postoperative analgesia in patients with total myomectomy.

Study Summary:
Uterine fibroids are common benign gynecological conditions. Patients who experience excessive menstruation, anemia, and pressure symptoms should be administered medication, and severe cases require a total hysterectomy. This procedure is invasive and causes severe postoperative pain, which can affect the patient's postoperative sleep quality and, thus, the recovery process. To evaluate use of dezocine in patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing total myomectomy. We selected 100 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids and randomized them into two groups: A control group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.06 mg/mL of morphine and an observation group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.3 mg/mL of diazoxide in their PCEA. Outcomes assessed included pain levels, sedation, recovery indices, PCEA usage, stress factors, and sleep quality. The observation group showed lower visual analog scale scores, shorter postoperative recovery indices, fewer mean PCEA compressions, lower cortisol and blood glucose levels, and better polysomnographic parameters compared to the control group (< 0.05). The cumulative incidence of adverse reactions was lower in the observation group than in the control group (< 0.05). Dezocine PCEA can effectively control the pain associated with total myomectomy, reduce the negative impact of stress factors, and have less impact on patients' sleep, consequently resulting in fewer adverse effects.
