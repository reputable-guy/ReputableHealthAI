Study Title: Community Health Benefits Through a Student-Run Nonprofit Pediatric Wellness Clinic.

Study Summary:
Purpose Community screening programs have been in effect since they were utilized in the 19th century at county fairs. A free pediatric health screening program was created by an osteopathic medical school in South Carolina in collaboration with a pediatric dental outreach organization to engage the local underserved community and train community-minded medical professionals. This study sought to demonstrate the efficacy and need for a student-run monthly pediatric health screening program in an underserved pediatric demographic. Methods A retrospective study of preexisting de-identified data obtained from a student-run health screening program was analyzed to determine the efficacy of the screening program in detecting chronic health risk factors in children in an underserved population. Patients were recruited through a partnership with a free dental clinic for underserved and uninsured children. Patients who attended the clinic were offered the opportunity to have a free, comprehensive health assessment following their dental visit. The function of this program was unique in that uninsured, underserved patients were provided free dental care and a free health assessment. Pediatric patients were screened for basic health information such as weight, height, BMI, vision, cardiovascular health, hypertension, asthma (reported via questionnaire by either the parent or child when applicable), nutrition, and lead poisoning (via questionnaire). The program also offered families additional support by connecting them to local resources and answering any questions they had about their children's health. Data from 14 health screening events was collected for quality improvement and efficacy monitoring. Descriptive analyses were performed. Results and analysis The health screening program assessed 124 children between October 2021 and March 2023 over 14 health screening events. The patients ranged from one year old to 26 years old, with a mean age of 9.65 years. Patients were predominantly Hispanic (79.67%). About one-third (27.64%) of children who were screened had positive findings associated with increased risk for chronic disease. Nearly half (43.90%) of families that were screened requested further information on ways to obtain health insurance and regular primary care services (utilized Access Health). Of the one-third of children with positive risk factors, 12.20% reported positive findings associated with asthma. Of the patients with positive risk factors, 8.94% had vision abnormalities, most of whom had not been seen by an ophthalmologist. This preliminary analysis will be followed by a secondary analysis that further investigates patient demographics (primarily Hispanic) as well as age distribution across various risk factors. Conclusion This pediatric health screening program has demonstrated a basic level of efficacy by successfully identifying increased risk for chronic disease in the underserved pediatric population. The need for these screening events was highlighted by the identification of untreated positive findings.
