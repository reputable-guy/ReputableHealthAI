Study Title: University Coaching for Activity and Nutrition (UCAN): A weight-inclusive health coaching program.

Study Summary:
Given the body image and disordered eating struggles prevalent in young adults, weight-inclusive anti-diet programs are needed on college campuses. Such programs replace weight loss advice with changes that center physical and mental well-being.University health and wellness programs such as University Coaching for Activity and Nutrition (UCAN) is a novel weight-inclusive health and wellness coaching program designed to support university students and faculty/staff in their development and maintenance of self-care behaviors related to physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Specifically, we describe the program's mechanisms for participant recruitment, health coach training, session protocol, program evaluation, and supervision so other campuses can replicate the program model at their respective universities.This work can help campuses cultivate positive self-care habits that improve physical and mental health through the lens of a weight-inclusive paradigm while also creating research and service-learning experiences for pre-health professionals.
