Study Title: Influence of text messages promoting mental imagery on self-reported physical activity in women with breast cancer: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to test whether text messages prompting women with breast cancer to perform motor imagery would increase self-report Physical Activity (PA) duration using a randomized parallel trial design. 52 participants were assigned to a Placebo, Imagery first or Imagery second group. The groups were exposed to two counterbalanced conditions: no morning text message or morning text message for 4 weeks. In the morning text message condition, the Imagery first and Imagery second groups received a message with the instruction to imagine realizing an aerobic exercise of their choice whereas the Placebo group received a placebo message, 3 days per week. In addition, all participants received an evening text message: "Did you do your cardio today? If yes, what did you do?". Before, during and after the experimental session the participants fulfilled questionnaires assessing weekly PA, motivation to perform PA, self-efficacy and fatigue. Participants in the Imagery groups reported significantly more weekly minutes of aerobic exercise and self-efficacy scores in the imagery morning message condition compared with the no morning message condition. The imagery groups reported significantly higher PA than participants in the Placebo group when the latter received the neutral morning message. Text message can be effective in increasing minutes of aerobic exercise and self-efficacy in women with breast cancer.
