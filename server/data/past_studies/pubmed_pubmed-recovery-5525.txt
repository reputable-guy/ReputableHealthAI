Study Title: A Tender Reduced-Intensity Conditioning for the Unfit: A Novel 4 Gy Total Body Irradiation-Based Conditioning Followed by Two-Step Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant, Results of a Prospective Trial.

Study Summary:
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) remains the only potentially curative treatment for many hematologic malignancies (HM). We previously developed a two-step approach that separates the lymphoid and myeloid portions of the graft, allowing a consistent T cell dosing and sparing the stem cells from the effect of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (CY). The two-step approach demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients treated with myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning. Here, we extended our two-step platform to older and less fit patients and explored the effects of using a high dose of T cells on disease relapse and transplant outcomes. Thirty-four patients with HM were treated. Median age was 68 years old and included a minority population constituting 32%. Eighty-two percent had a hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index score &#x2265;3. Ninety-one percent were haploidentical, and the rest were matched-related donor HSCT. Following administration of fludarabine and 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) (13 patients) or 4 Gy TBI (21 patients) conditioning regimen, a fixed dose of 2 &#xd7; 10/kg CD3+ T cells was given, followed 2 days later by CY, then infusion of CD34-selected stem cells. Overall survival (OS) was 70% at 1 year and 48% at 3 years. The cumulative incidence (CI) of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were 22% and 33% at 3 years. However, the CI of relapse was much lower for patients treated with 4 Gy TBI versus those treated with 2 Gy TBI (11% versus 54%, P = .045), while NRM was similar (23% versus 15%, P = .399). This contributed to a high OS of 64% in patients who received 4 Gy TBI-based conditioning at 3 years, with median OS not reached, although this was not statistically significant (P = .68). The median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 12 and 17 days, respectively. The CI of grade II acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) was 22% and 26% at 100 days and 6 months, respectively. The CI of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 7.5% at 3 years. There was no grade III or IV aGVHD, no severe cGVHD, and no deaths attributable to GVHD. In conclusion, the two-step approach HSCT demonstrated a low disease relapse rate and high survival in patients treated with 4 Gy TBI-based conditioning, despite a generally older and more medically compromised patient population.
