Study Title: Early enteral nutrition with arginine compensates for negative nitrogen balance in patients undergoing curative total gastrectomy.

Study Summary:
The effects of early enteral arginine-rich nutrition (EAN) were analyzed among patients undergoing curative-intent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. There were 19 patients in this prospective study, all randomly assigned to either a parenteral nutrition (PN) group or an EAN group for the first seven days after surgery. The EAN group received 1.8-fold greater arginine (10.1 g/day) compared with the PN group, which was administered through an enteral tube inserted into the jejunal loop. Both groups were provided almost identical amounts of total amino acids (54 g/day), and the total energy was set at 65% of the total requirement (25 kcal/kg/day). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, oral intake, nutritional status, or body weight. The serum arginine profile was similar in the two groups, as it decreased significantly on postoperative day (POD) 1, and gradually returned to preoperative levels by POD 7. The nitrogen balance remained negative until POD 7 in the PN group, but turned neutral at POD 7 in the EAN group. While we could not confirm body weight loss improvement, these results suggested that early arginine-rich enteral nutrition could improve the nitrogen balance after total gastrectomy. J. Med.
