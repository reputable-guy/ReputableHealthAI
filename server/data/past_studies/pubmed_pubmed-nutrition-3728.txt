Study Title: Adaptive Nutrition Intervention Stabilizes Serum Phosphorus Levels in Hemodialysis Patients: A Multicenter Decentralized Clinical Trial Using Real-World Data.

Study Summary:
This study aims to evaluate the effect of an adaptive nutritional and educational intervention for patients on hemodialysis (HD) in a routine care setting, using real-world data from electronic health records. Decentralized clinical trial of seven HD facilities recruited patients who have been on HD for over 3&#xa0;months (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;153) for an 8-week adaptive intervention protocol. Patients were divided into four groups: (1) control (2) education intervention (3) meal intervention (4) education and meal interventions. Educational contents were digitally delivered via mobile phones and premade meals tailored on laboratory findings were home-delivered. Changes in serum electrolytes and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS) were analyzed. Meal intervention statistically significantly stabilized serum phosphorus level (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.81&#xa0;mg/dL, 95% confidence interval&#xa0;=&#xa0;[-1.40, -0.22]) at week 8, with increased likelihood of being within target serum value range (odds ratio&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.21, 95% confidence interval&#xa0;=&#xa0;[1.04, 1.40]). Meal group showed better nutritional status (MIS&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.65) than the education group (MIS&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.10) at week 8 (adjusted p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05). No significant changes were observed in serum potassium level, depression, and self-efficacy. It was demonstrated that an adaptive meal intervention in a real-world care setting may benefit serum phosphorus control and nutritional status of patients on HD, without negative effect on depression levels or self-efficacy. More work is needed to develop an effective educational intervention.
