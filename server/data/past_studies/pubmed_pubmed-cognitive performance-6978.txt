Study Title: The ketogenic diet in patients with myoclonic status in non-progressive encephalopathy.

Study Summary:
Myoclonic status in non-progressive encephalopathy (MSNPE) is characterized by the recurrence of long-lasting atypical status epilepticus associated with attention impairment and continuous polymorphous jerks, mixed with other complex abnormal movements, in infants suffering from a non-progressive encephalopathy. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used as an alternative to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for patients with refractory epileptic encephalopathies. In this study we assess the efficacy and tolerability of the KD in patients with MSNPE. Between March 1, 1980 and August 31, 2013, 99 patients who met the diagnostic criteria of MSNPE were seen (58 patients in Verona and 41 patients in Buenos Aires). Six of these 99 patients were placed on the KD using the Hopkins protocol and followed for a minimum period of 24 months. Twelve months after initiating the diet, three patients had a 75%-99% decrease in seizures, two had a 50%-74% decrease in seizures, and the remaining child had a less than 50% seizure reduction. In five patients with a seizure reduction of more than 50%, the myoclonic status epilepticus disappeared within 6 months after starting the diet. All patients had very good tolerability and no adverse events were identified. In most of the patients AEDs were reduced. The KD is a promising therapy for MSNPE, with most of our patients showing a more than 50% seizure reduction. In patients that responded well to the diet cognitive performance and quality of life also improved.
