Study Title: Early Oral Feeding is Safe and Comfortable in Patients with Gastric Cancer Undergoing Radical Total Gastrectomy.

Study Summary:
Data supporting the safety and clinical efficacy of early oral feeding (EOF) after total gastrectomy are limited. The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to explore the safety and clinical efficacy of two early enteral nutrition approaches for gastric cancer patients after radical total gastrectomy. The EOF group had faster postoperative recovery of intestinal function than the enteral tube feeding (ETF) group. The times to first flatus and first defecation were shorter in the EOF group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In addition, the EOF protocol effectively avoided abdominal distension (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The hospitalization cost of the EOF group was lower than that of the ETF group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Moreover, oral nutrition satisfied the physiological need for oral intake. People were more satisfied with EOF (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Furthermore, it is worth noting that compared with ETF, EOF did not increase the risk of anastomotic complications such as leakage and bleeding. Most obviously, EOF not only avoided the risk of complications during tube insertion, but also avoided the discomfort experience of nasal feeding tube. In summary, compared with ETF, EOF promotes early bowel recovery effectively without increasing the risk of postoperative complications. It is safe and comfortable for gastric cancer patients undergoing radical total gastrectomy.
