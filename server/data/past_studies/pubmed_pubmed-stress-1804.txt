Study Title: Cognitive analytic therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Post-traumatic stress disorder represents a multifaceted clinical entity with a profound impact on mental health. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of cognitive analytic therapy on the manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder. From May 21, 2023, to July 7, 2023, we conducted a randomized control trial in the outpatient clinic of a psychiatry Hospital. Participants were Iran-Iraq war veterans (&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) with a confirmed diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. They were randomly allocated to cognitive analytic therapy and control groups. The primary outcome was re-experiencing, and the secondary outcomes included avoidance, hyperarousal, depression, anxiety, and numbness scores measured by appropriate questionnaires before and after the interventions. The cognitive analytic therapy group received a weekly program totaling 12 sessions of therapy adjunct to pharmacotherapy, each session lasting 90&#x2009;min, and the control group received only pharmacotherapy. Within-group analysis showed that cognitive analytic therapy (&#x2009;=&#x2009;19) decreased all symptom scores (all&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), while the control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) showed a decrease in hyper-arousal, depression, and anxiety (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) scores. Between-group analysis implied that cognitive analytic therapy was more successful than usual pharmacotherapy in decreasing all outcome scores (all&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). A 12-session program of cognitive analytic therapy was effective in alleviating re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal, depression, anxiety, and numbness in post-traumatic stress disorder. It was safe and acceptable by participants reflected by a high retention rate. We recommend the incorporation of cognitive analytic therapy to the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.
