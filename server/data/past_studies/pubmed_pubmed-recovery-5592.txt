Study Title: Assessing the Potential of an Enzymatically Liberated Salmon Oil to Support Immune Health Recovery from Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection via Change in the Expression of Cytokine, Chemokine and Interferon-Related Genes.

Study Summary:
Cytokines, chemokines, and interferons are released in response to viral infection with the ultimate aim of viral clearance. However, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an imbalanced immune response, with raised cytokine levels but only a limited interferon response with inefficient viral clearance. Furthermore, the inflammatory response can be exaggerated, which risks both acute and chronic sequelae. Several observational studies have suggested a reduced risk of progression to severe COVID-19 in subjects with a higher omega-3 index. However, randomized studies of omega-3 supplementation have failed to replicate this benefit. Omega-3 fats provide important anti-inflammatory effects; however, fatty fish contains many other fatty acids that provide health benefits distinct from omega-3. Therefore, the immune health benefit of whole salmon oil (SO) was assessed in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. Eleven subjects were randomized to best supportive care (BSC) with or without a full spectrum, enzymatically liberated SO, dosed at 4g daily, for twenty-eight days. Nasal swabs were taken to measure the change in gene expression of markers of immune response and showed that the SO provided both broad inflammation-resolving effects and improved interferon response. The results also suggest improved lung barrier function and enhanced immune memory, although the clinical relevance needs to be assessed in longer-duration studies. In conclusion, the salmon oil was well tolerated and provided broad inflammation-resolving effects, indicating a potential to enhance immune health.
