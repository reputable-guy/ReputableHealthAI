Study Title: Move or Not to Move: Factors of Mind-Body Practice Engagement in a Population-Based Study.

Study Summary:
Mind-body practices (MBPs), which include seated- (meditation) and movement-based practices (yoga, Tai Chi,), have grown increasingly popular in the United States for improving mental and physical wellness. While literature has identified socioeconomic and health-related factors related to seated- and movement-MBP engagement separately, no studies have explored the factors associated with combined-MBP use. This study accordingly used Anderson's behavioral model of health service utilization to explore sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with seated-, movement-, and combined-MBP engagement among a representative adult sample in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey.Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression using survey weights examined associations between predisposing (,,,,, and), enabling (,,, and), and needs factors (,,) with type of MBP engagement.Nearly 6% (5.8%) of the U.S. adult population practiced combined-MBPs. Results also showed that educational attainment was associated with increasingly higher odds of utilizing all forms of MBPs and revealed racial-ethnic disparities in movement- and combined-MBP engagement. Combined-MBP engagement was roughly two times higher among those with moderate psychological distress (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.58-2.32;< 0.001), severe psychological distress (RRR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.35-2.85;< 0.001), and chronic pain.Findings suggest that combined-MBPs are utilized by a significant portion of the U.S. population and that engagement has varied distribution across sociodemographic and health factors. Considering the association of combined-MBP usage with mental and physical health needs, the authors recommend that health care providers suggest combined-MBPs as an additional resource for patients with psychological distress or mild chronic pain. Future practice and research can focus on increasing accessibility to MBPs in education settings to reduce racial-ethnic disparities.
