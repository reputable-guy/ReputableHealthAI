Study Title: Therapeutic effects of acyclovir and acyclovir-clobetasol nanofibers vs. cream formulation for recurrent herpes labialis.

Study Summary:
This study aims to compare the therapeutic effects of acyclovir nanofiber and acyclovir-clobetasol nanofiber formulations with their non-nano formulations (cream formulation) on recurrent labial herpes. Eighty patients with labial herpes lesions were divided into four groups, each receiving one of the following treatments: acyclovir-clobetasol nano patch, acyclovir-clobetasol cream, acyclovir nano patch, or acyclovir cream. Pain levels and recovery times were assessed. The Wilcoxon test compared pain levels, while the log-rank test compared healing and scabbing times. Acyclovir-clobetasol nanofiber and cream, along with acyclovir nanofiber, significantly reduced symptoms compared to the acyclovir cream. The recovery and scabbing times were shorter in patients who received acyclovir-clobetasol formulations compared to those receiving acyclovir alone. Acyclovir-clobetasol combinations accelerated recovery times compared to acyclovir alone. Additionally, nanofiber formulations demonstrated enhanced healing efficacy over cream formulations. This trial was retrospectively registered by Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) at 14/11/2023. IRCT20230926059521N1.
