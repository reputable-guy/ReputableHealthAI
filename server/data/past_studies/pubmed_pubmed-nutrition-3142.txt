Study Title: Relationships of B12 and Homocysteine with Outcomes in the SURE-PD, SURE-PD3, and STEADY-PDIII Trials.

Study Summary:
DATATOP was a study of early Parkinson's disease (PD) conducted in the 1980&#x200a;s, before mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States. Our analysis of its baseline serum samples revealed a geometric mean vitamin B12 of 369&#x200a;pg/mL and homocysteine (tHcy) of 9.5&#x3bc;mol/l. We also found that low B12 predicted greater worsening of ambulatory capacity (AC) and elevated tHcy (>15&#x3bc;mol/L) predicted greater declines in cognitive function. We sought to measure B12 and tHcy in contemporary trial participants with early PD who had not started dopaminergic treatment and to determine whether these analytes were associated with clinical progression. We measured B12 and tHcy from baseline and end-of-study blood samples from three recent clinical trials. Baseline geometric mean B12 levels for these studies ranged from 484- 618&#x200a;pg/ml and for tHcy ranged from 7.4- 10&#x3bc;mol/L. Use of B12-containing supplements ranged from 41- 61%, and those taking supplements had higher B12 and lower tHcy. Those who began levodopa, but were not taking B12-supplements, had greater end-of-study tHcy. There was no association of baseline tHcy&#x200a;>&#x200a;15&#x3bc;mol/L with annualized change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment and no association of baseline B12 tertiles with change in AC. In these longitudinal trials, B12 levels were higher than for DATATOP, due in large part to increased B12-supplement intake, while tHcy levels were similar. Initiation of levodopa was associated with increases of tHcy in those not taking a B12-containing supplement. These smaller studies did not replicate prior findings of low B12 and elevated tHcy with features of progression, possibly due to higher baseline B12.
