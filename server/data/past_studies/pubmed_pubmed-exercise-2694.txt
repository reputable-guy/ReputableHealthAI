Study Title: Rehydration effect of qingshu buye decoction on exercise and high temperature-induced dehydration.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the rehydration efficacy of QSBYD and elucidate its potential underlying mechanism. 38 participants were randomly assigned to receive either QSBYD or placebo before and after exercise and heat-induced dehydration. Hydration indicators were measured over time. Blood tests assessed cellular anaerobic respiration metabolites, serum inflammatory markers, and coagulation markers. Perceptual measures of thirst, fatigue, and muscular soreness were also taken. QSBYD consumption resulted in lower urine volume (Control vs. QSBYD: 260.83&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;167.99&#x2009;ml vs. 187.78&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;141.34&#x2009;ml) and smaller decrease in percentage of nude body weight change from baseline (Control vs. QSBYD: -0.52&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.89% vs. -0.07&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.52%). Although no significant differences in urine specific gravity, QSBYD resulted in reduced urine volume at 120&#x2009;min, suggesting improved fluid retention. Furthermore, QSBYD resulted in lower levels of IL-1&#x3b2; (Control vs. QSBYD: 2.40&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.68 vs. 1.33&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.66&#x2009;pg/mL), suggesting QSBYD may provide benefits beyond hydration. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and long-term effects of QSBYD on hydration is warranted. QSBYD may be an effective alternative to commercial sports drinks in mitigating dehydration effects.
