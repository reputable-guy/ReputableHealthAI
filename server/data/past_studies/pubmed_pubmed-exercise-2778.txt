Study Title: Sex-Related Glycemic and Cardiovascular Responses After Continuous and Interval Aerobic Sessions in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes: A Randomized Crossover Study.

Study Summary:
We aimed to investigate sex-related glycemic and cardiovascular responses after intensity- (moderate) and duration- (30 minutes) matched interval aerobic exercise (IAE) and continuous (CAE) aerobic exercise sessions in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). A total of 19 volunteers (10 women) participated in 2 randomized and crossover sessions (1:1). Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, double product, and blood glucose (BG) levels were measured before (PRE), immediately after (POST-0), and 20 minutes after (POST-20) each session. The rates of perceived exertion (RPE) and enjoyment levels (ELs) were assessed after each session. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the data (condition &#xd7; time &#xd7; sex). Regarding sex-related changes, men showed BG reductions at POST-0 and POST-20 after CAE (&#x2206;: -3.7 and -3.7 mmol/L, respectively) and only at POST-0 after IAE (&#x2206;: -1.6 mmol/L), with 1 episode of hypoglycemia occurring in the latter group. In contrast, women showed reduced BG values only after CAE at both time points (&#x2206;: -1.4 and -1.7 mmol/L) compared with PRE values. The decrease in BG levels at both time points was higher for men after CAE than IAE. Cardiovascular responses, RPEs, and ELs were similar between exercise sessions, except for blood pressure, which showed higher values in men. In conclusion, lower BG levels were observed after CAE, with greater reductions in men. Similar cardiovascular, RPE, and EL responses were found across sexes and sessions. Consideration of sex-specific recommendations may be warranted when prescribing aerobic exercise, particularly, for men with irregular physical activity levels.
