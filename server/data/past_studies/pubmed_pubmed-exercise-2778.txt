Study Title: Respiratory physiological mechanism of two types of equal-intensity inspiratory muscle training in stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the respiratory physiological changes resulting from short-term inspiratory resistance training (R-IMT) and inspiratory threshold training (T-IMT) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to compare the mechanisms of the two training methods. A total of 75 stable patients with COPD combined with inspiratory muscle weakness were randomly allocated to three groups: R-IMT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26), T-IMT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24), and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25). Before and after 8 weeks of inspiratory muscle training(IMT), cardiopulmonary exercise tests were conducted to assess respiratory patterns, respiratory central drive, exercise tolerance, and ventilation efficiency. After 8 weeks of IMT, Inspiratory muscle strength, represented by MIP (maximum inspiratory mouth pressure) and exercise capacity increased during exercise in both IMT groups (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). In the R-IMT group, inspiratory time (Ti) prolonged (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), tidal volume (Vt) increased (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), ventilation efficiency (represented by ventilation-center coupling) increased (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) during exercise. Conversely, the T-IMT group did not exhibit any of these changes after IMT (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). In summary, the improvement in exercise tolerance was associated with an increase in inspiratory muscle reserve in both R-IMT and T-IMT. However, only R-IMT was associated with deeper and slower breathing, as well as improved ventilation efficiency.
