Study Title: Predictive Energy Equations Inaccurately Estimate Metabolic Demands of Older Adult Trauma Patients.

Study Summary:
Suboptimal nutrition promotes unfavorable outcomes in trauma patients, particularly among those aged 60 and over. While many institutions employ predictive energy equations to determine patients' energy requirements, mounting evidence shows these equations inaccurately estimate caloric needs. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we sought to quantify the discrepancy between predictive equations and indirect calorimetry (IC)-the gold standard for determining energy requirements-in the older adult trauma population. This is a nested cohort study within a pilot randomized control trial in which 32 older adult trauma patients were randomized 3:1 to receive IC-guided nutrition delivery versus standard of care. IC requirements of patients in the intervention arm were compared to Mifflin St. Jeor (MSJ), Harris-Benedict (HB), and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition-Society of Critical Care Medicine (ASPEN-SCCM) predictive energy equations. Twenty patients underwent IC to assess measured resting energy expenditure (mREE), yielding a mean (standard deviation) mREE of 23.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.8&#xa0;kcal/kg/d. MSJ and HB gave mean predictive resting energy expenditures of 17.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.0 and 18.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.0&#xa0;kcal/kg/d in these patients, demonstrating that IC-derived values were 32.1% and 25.0% higher, respectively. When patients were stratified by body mass index (BMI), MSJ, and HB more severely underestimated caloric requirements in individuals with BMI <30 versus BMI 30-50. While the mean mREE fell within the mean predictive&#xa0;resting energy expenditure range prescribed by ASPEN-SCCM equations (21.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.1 to 26.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.3&#xa0;kcal/kg/d), individuals' IC-derived values fell within their personal range in 8 of 20 cases. The MSJ and HB predictive energy equations consistently and significantly underpredict metabolic demands of older adult trauma patients compared to IC and perform worse in lower BMI individuals. ASPEN-SCCM equations frequently overpredict or underpredict resting energy expenditure. While these findings should be confirmed in a larger randomized control trial, this study suggests that institutions should prioritize IC to accurately identify the metabolic demands of older trauma patients.
