Study Title: Optimizing Performance and Mental Skills With Mindfulness-Based Attention Training: Two Field Studies With Operational Units.

Study Summary:
Mental skills such as focusing attention and managing emotions are essential for optimal performance in high-stress occupations. Studies with military samples have demonstrated that mindfulness training (MT) led to improved computer-based cognitive performance. To examine the impact of MT on operational performance, mental skills, and psychological health, a short-form program, Mindfulness-Based Attention Training (MBAT), was delivered to active duty soldiers as part of two randomized trials. Participants in study 1 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;121) and study 2 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;77) were randomized to one of three conditions: MT with proctored practice, MT with unproctored practice, or a waitlist control. Weekly 2-hour MBAT sessions were offered to participants in both MT conditions for 4 weeks. Beyond these sessions, participants also engaged in mindfulness practice that was proctored (within the occupational context) or unproctored (left up to the individual) for four subsequent weeks. Overall, the frequency of mindfulness practice was generally associated with better performance and improvements in mental skills. In study 1, those who practiced 3 or more days per week performed better on marksmanship under physical stress and reported fewer attentional lapses, less emotion regulation difficulties, greater mental toughness, and higher self-reported mindfulness compared to those who did not practice. In study 2, the frequency of mindfulness practice was associated with fewer attentional lapses and emotion regulation difficulties. Consistent with prior findings, results suggest that regular engagement in MT practice may help to optimize operational performance and improve mental skills in military cohorts.
