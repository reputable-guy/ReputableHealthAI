Study Title: Effectiveness of Internet&#x2009;+&#x2009;E-Coach chronic disease management on blood glucose, lipid levels, liver function, and quality of life in patients with chronic diabetic retinopathy: a comparative study.

Study Summary:
This study aims to explore the effect of Internet&#x2009;+&#x2009;E-Coach chronic disease system intervention on fasting blood glucose (FPG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose(2hPG), fasting serum insulin (FINS), triglyceride (TG), alanine transaminase (ALT) and quality of life in patients with chronic diabetic retinopathy. 208 patients with chronic diabetic retinopathy who were treated in the hospital from March 2021 to March 2023 are chosen and separated into two groups by random number Table 104 patients in the control group received routine continuous intervention, and the research group received Internet&#x2009;+&#x2009;E-Coach chronic disease system intervention. The cognition of disease related knowledge, blood related indicators inflammatory factor levels and improvement of life quality between the two groups before intervention, 6 and 12 months after intervention were compared. Before the intervention, the comparison between the two groups in disease related knowledge scores, blood glucose, blood lipid, liver function indicators, inflammatory factor, and low vision quality of life scale (CLVQOL) scores was with P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05. After 6 and 12 months of intervention, the research group had significantly higher scores for basic blood glucose intervention, healthy diet, reasonable exercise, and correct medication use compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). FPG, 2hPG, TG and ALT in the research group were lower than those in the control group. FINS were higher in the control group, with P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#x3b1;), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) in the research group were obviously lower than those in the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The scores of far vision, movement and light perception, adjustment ability, reading and fine work, and daily living ability in the research group were higher than those in the control group, with P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05. The intervention of Internet&#x2009;+&#x2009;E-Coach chronic disease system can improve the knowledge of chronic diabetic retinopathy patients about their own condition, stabilize the levels of blood sugar, blood lipid and liver function indicators, reduce the inflammatory reaction of the body, and improve the quality of life.
