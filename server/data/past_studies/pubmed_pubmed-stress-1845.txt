Study Title: Examining the oleoylethanolamide supplement effects on glycemic status, oxidative stress, inflammation, and anti-mullerian hormone in polycystic ovary syndrome.

Study Summary:
This clinical trial was designed and conducted due to the anti-inflammatory potential of Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) to examine the effect of OEA supplement on glycemic status, oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study was a randomized clinical trial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled that was carried out on 90 women with PCOS. Patients were divided into two groups: receiving an OEA supplement (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45) or a placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45). The intervention group received 125&#xa0;mg/day OEA and the placebo group received the wheat flour for 8 weeks. Demographic data were collected through questionnaires. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin resistance (IR), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), and AMH were measured before and after the study. Data analysis of food recall and physical activity questionnaires, showed no significant differences between the two groups (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Biochemical factors including glycemic status, MDA, inflammatory factors, and AMH decreased significantly (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). TAC increased remarkably (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) in comparison between the two groups, after the intervention. OEA supplement with anti-inflammatory characteristics could be efficient independent of diet changes and physical activity in improving disrupted biochemical factors, so both supplementation or food resources of this fatty acid could be considered as a compensatory remedy in patients with PCOS. This study was retrospectively (09-01-2022) registered in the Iranian website ( www.irct.ir ) for registration of clinical trials (IRCT20141025019669N20).
