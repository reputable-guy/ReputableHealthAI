Study Title: Impact of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Parenteral Nutrition on Inflammatory Markers and Clinical Outcomes in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The heightened inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients suggests that omega-3 fatty acids (O3FA) may confer anti-inflammatory benefits. This randomized, double-blind, single-center clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effect of O3FA supplementation in parenteral nutrition (PN) on inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 69 patients were randomized into three groups: one received standard lipid emulsion, and two received O3FA (Omegaven) at doses of 0.1 g/kg/day and 0.2 g/kg/day, respectively, in addition to Smoflipid. The primary outcomes measured were serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on days 1, 5, and 10 of PN initiation. Secondary outcomes included additional inflammatory markers (TNF-&#x3b1;, IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-1Ra, CXCL10), hepatic function, triglyceride levels, and clinical outcomes such as mortality and length of ICU and hospital stay. Results indicated a significant reduction in CRP, IL-6, and CXCL10 levels in the group receiving 0.1 g/kg/day O3FA compared to the control. Additionally, the higher O3FA dose was associated with a shorter ICU and hospital stay. These findings suggest that O3FA supplementation in PN may reduce inflammation and improve clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
