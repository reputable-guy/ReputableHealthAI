Study Title: Telerehabilitation improves cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness and body composition in older people with post-COVID-19 syndrome.

Study Summary:
The effects of post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome on the cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness in older people are of utmost relevance. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week telerehabilitation programme on cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness and body composition in older patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome. One hundred twenty older patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome were randomly assigned to one of two groups: patients who carried out the telerehabilitation programme (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;60; age: 65.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.2; female: 14.2%) and a control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;60; age: 64.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.0; female: 24.5%). An incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing, isokinetic strength test, and bioelectrical impedance analysis were performed to compare cardiorespiratory and muscle strength responses and body composition between telerehabilitation and control groups. A significant increase in the cardiopulmonary exercise testing duration was found in the telerehabilitation group compared to the control group (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;88.9&#xa0;s, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). Peak oxygen uptake increased in the telerehabilitation group (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.0&#xa0;mL&#xb7;kg&#xb7;min, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and control group (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;mL&#xb7;kg&#xb7;min, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Power output in cycle ergometer (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;25.9 watts, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), fat free mass (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;kg, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004), soft lean mass (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;kg, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003), and skeletal muscle mass (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;kg, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003) only increased in the telerehabilitation group. A significant increase in the power output was observed in the telerehabilitation group compared with the control group in both lower limbs after isokinetic strength test of the leg extension at a speed of 60&#xb0; (right: mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;18.7 watts, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.012; left: mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;15.3 watts, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.010). The peak torque of right leg extension increased only in the telerehabilitation group after isokinetic strength test at a speed of 60&#xb0; (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;13.1&#xa0;N&#xb7;m, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). A significant increase in the power output was observed in the telerehabilitation group compared with the control group in the left leg extension after isokinetic strength test at a speed of 180&#xb0; (mean difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;30.2 watts, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003). The telerehabilitation programme improved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and body composition in older patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome to a greater extent than a control group. The telerehabilitation programmes may be an alternative to improve the sequelae of post-COVID-19 syndrome in older patients.
