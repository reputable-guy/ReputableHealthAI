Study Title: Optimal functioning after early mild traumatic brain injury: Evolution and predictors.

Study Summary:
Early mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI or concussion sustained between 0 and 5 years old) can lead to post-concussive symptoms, behavioral changes, and cognitive difficulties. Although school-age children (6-17 years old) experience similar consequences, severe neuropsychological deficits are not common, and the majority have no persisting symptoms after one month. Thus, there may be value in focusing on what characterizes optimal functioning (or wellness) after mTBI, but this has not been explored in young children. This study documents the evolution and predictors of optimal functioning after early mTBI. Participants were 190 children aged 18 - 60 months with mTBI (= 69), orthopedic injury (OI;= 50), or typical development (TDC;= 71). Optimal functioning was defined as: (1) no clinically significant behavioral problems; (2) no cognitive difficulties; (3) no persisting post-concussive symptoms; (4) average quality of life or better. Predictors related to sociodemographic, injury, child, and caregiver characteristics included number of acute symptoms, child sex, age, temperament, maternal education, parent-child attachment and interaction quality, and parenting stress. Fewer children with mTBI had optimal functioning over 6 and 18-months post-injury compared to those with OI and TDC. Higher parent-child interaction quality and lower child negative affectivity temperament independently predicted optimal functioning. Children who sustain early mTBI are less likely to exhibit optimal functioning than&#xa0;their peers in the long-term. Parent-child interaction quality could be a potential intervention target for promoting optimal function.
