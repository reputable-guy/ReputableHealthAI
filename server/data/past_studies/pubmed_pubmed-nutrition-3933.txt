Study Title: Protein-Energy Supplementation in Early-Life Decreases the Odds of Mental Distress in Later Adulthood in Guatemala.

Study Summary:
The prevalence of mental health concerns is growing worldwide, along with lack of access to and receipt of needed treatment. Current gaps in treatment provision have led to exploring alternative methods of prevention, with research linking nutrition and mental health, of particular relevance in low- and middle-income countries, with a high prevalence of undernutrition. To examine whether exposure to a protein-energy nutritional supplement during the first 1000 d of life decreased odds of mental distress in adulthood among men and women in Guatemala compared with receiving a low energy-no protein supplement or supplementation outside the 1000-d window. Data from participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1249) in a longitudinal cohort protein-energy supplementation trial (early-life, supplementation data from 1969 to 1977, ages 0-7 y; life course, outcome data from 2017-2018 follow-up, ages 40-57 y) were analyzed for associations between nutrition in the first 1000 d and mental distress in adulthood (WHO Self-Reporting Questionnaire 20 [SRQ-20]), controlling for early-life variables and current life stress; life course variables (e.g. education) were examined as potential mediators of this relation. Generalized linear mixed models and zero-inflated Poisson generalized linear mixed models were utilized. Both partial and full supplementation with Atole during the first 1000 d were associated with 63% (95% CI: 0.16, 0.87) and 56% (95% CI: 0.19, 1.03) lower odds, respectively, of experiencing mental distress in adulthood. Results did not differ by sex. These inverse relations remained relatively unchanged (partial OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.34 [95% CI: 0.14, 0.83]; full OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.38 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.92]) after controlling for early-life and life course variables, including life stress. Protein-energy supplementation during the first 1000 d of life in Guatemala, where undernutrition is prevalent, may reduce the prevalence of later mental distress in adulthood. This effect appears to occur directly, rather than indirectly, through pathways of life course variables such as education, wealth, and marital status.
