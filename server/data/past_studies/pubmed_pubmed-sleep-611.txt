Study Title: Failure of an electric rocking device to improve neonatal sleep.

Study Summary:
We wanted to investigate whether an electric rocking device (Swing2Sleep, Neum&#xfc;nster, Germany), sold with the claim to promote infant sleep, would increase total sleep time or reduce sleep latency once infants are put therein. In a randomised crossover design, 20 infants (median gestational age at birth 31.7&#x2009;weeks, range 25-39) were placed to sleep either first with the device rocking, then not rocking (or vice versa) for 5-7&#x2009;h each. The device consisted of a hammock with three spiral springs that performed vertical swings at a rate of 100/min and an amplitude of 2.5&#x2009;cm. There was no significant difference in %time spent asleep (83 (22-97) vs. 85% (49-96)), sleep latency (7.7 (2-45) vs. 12.3 (4-42) min), sleep fragmentation (1.3 (0.5-2.3) vs. 1.1 (0.2-5.5)) or efficiency (0.8 (0.2-1.0) vs. 0.9 (0.5-1.0)) between both conditions. At its recommended settings, the device did not achieve its intended effect in these infants.
