Study Title: Effects of combined anodal transcranial direct current stimulation and motor control exercise on cortical topography and muscle activation in individuals with chronic low back pain: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Aberrant movement in chronic low back pain (CLBP) is associated with a deficit in the lumbar multifidus (LM) and changes in cortical topography. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) can be used to enhance cortical excitability by priming the neuromuscular system for motor control exercise (MCE), thereby enhancing LM activation and movement control. This study aimed to determine the effects of a 6-week MCE program combined with a-tDCS on cortical topography, LM activation, movement patterns, and clinical outcomes in individuals with CLBP. Twenty-two individuals with CLBP were randomly allocated to the a-tDCS group (a-tDCS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12) or sham-tDCS group (s-tDCS; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10). Both groups received 20&#xa0;min of tDCS followed by 30&#xa0;min of MCE. The LM and erector spinae (ES) cortical topography, LM activation, movement control battery tests, and clinical outcomes (disability and quality of life) were measured pre- and post-intervention. Significant interaction (group&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;time; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01) was found in the distance between LM and ES cortical locations. The a-tDCS group demonstrated significantly fewer discrete peaks (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) in both ES and LM and significant improvements (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) in clinical outcomes post-intervention. The s-tDCS group demonstrated a significant increase (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) in the number of discrete peaks in the LM cortical topography. No significant changes (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05) in LM activation were observed in either group; however, both groups demonstrated improved movement patterns. Our findings suggest that combined a-tDCS with MCE can separate LM and ES locations over time while s-tDCS (MCE alone) reduces the distance. Our study did not find superior benefits of adding a-tDCS before MCE for LM activation, movement patterns, or clinical outcomes.
