Study Title: The effect of an acute bout of exercise on circulating vitamin D metabolite concentrations: a randomised crossover study in healthy adults.

Study Summary:
The effect of acute exercise on circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites is unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the effect of a bout of treadmill-based exercise versus rest on circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D, 3-epi-25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, and vitamin Dand Din healthy men and women. Thirty-three healthy adults (14 females, 41 (15) years, body mass index 26.2 (3.7) kg/m,36.2 (9.2) ml/kg/min; mean (SD)) completed two laboratory visits involving 60&#xa0;min of moderate-intensity treadmill exercise (60%) versus 60&#xa0;min of seated rest, both in an overnight fasted-state, as part of a randomised crossover design. Venous blood samples were drawn at baseline, immediately (0&#xa0;h), 1&#xa0;h and 24&#xa0;h after the exercise or rest-period. There was a significant time &#xd7; trial interaction effect for total circulating 25(OH)D (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0148), 25(OH)D(P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0127) and 1,25(OH)D(P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0226). Immediately post-exercise, 25(OH)D, 25(OH)Dand 1,25(OH)Dconcentrations were significantly elevated compared to the control resting condition, and 1,25(OH)Dremained significantly elevated 1 h later. Circulating albumin, vitamin D binding protein, calcium and parathyroid hormone were elevated immediately post-exercise. Thus, an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise transiently increases concentrations of circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)Dcompared to resting conditions. KEY POINTS: Observational studies suggest that acute exercise might change circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites, but this has not been investigated using randomised crossover studies and using robust analytical procedures. In this study, we used a randomised crossover design to examine the effect of a bout of treadmill-based exercise (vs. rest) on circulating concentrations of a wide range of vitamin D metabolites in healthy humans. We show that an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise transiently increases concentrations of circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)Dcompared to resting conditions. These findings indicate that regular exercise could lead to transient but regular windows of enhanced vitamin D biological action.
