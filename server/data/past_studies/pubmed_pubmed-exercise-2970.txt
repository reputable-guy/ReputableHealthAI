Study Title: Impact of 12-Month Late-in-Life Exercise Training on Cardiopulmonary Reserve, Static Cardiac Structure, and Function: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Although the cardiac benefits of maintaining a lifelong exercise routine are undisputed, to what extent late-in-life exercise training can ameliorate cardiac aging remains unclear. We examined the impact of a 12-month exercise training program on cardiac reserve, static cardiac structure, and cardiac function in older adults. This study was a single-center, randomized trial using Zelen design. Participants in the center-based exercise (CBE) group underwent an individualized multicomponent exercise training program. In total, 120 community-dwelling older adults aged 65-85&#xa0;years were evenly divided into a CBE group and a control group. The primary outcome indicator was absolute change in peak oxygen uptake (peakVO) per kilogram from baseline to 12&#xa0;months. The secondary outcome indicators were the absolute changes in other cardiopulmonary exercise test indices and cardiac magnetic resonance parameters. This study has been registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Network (ChiCTR2400081824). In total, 47 older adults in the control group and 49 in the CBE group ultimately completed the 12-month follow-up and were analyzed. Of all participants, 52 (46.4%) were men, and the mean age was 71.22 &#xb1; 4.55&#xa0;years. The absolute change in peakVO/kg was significantly different between the CBE and control groups by&#xa0;+3.32&#xa0;mL/kg/min (95% CI 2.10-4.53; P < .001), and a sex-related difference was observed. Additionally, the right ventricular peak filling and ejection rate improved to a greater degree in the CBE than control group (+65.57&#xa0;mL/s, P&#xa0;= .006;&#xa0;+56.39&#xa0;mL/s, P&#xa0;= .026, respectively). A 12-month exercise training program started later in life was effective in improving cardiopulmonary reserve, and men showed a better response to training than women. The right ventricular function increased after late-in-life exercise training.
