Study Title: Prevalence of toddlers meeting 24-hour movement guidelines and associations with parental perceptions and practices.

Study Summary:
Whether toddlers (1-2 years) meet 24-hour Movement Guidelines and how parental practices and perceptions are related to compliance are uncertain. This study: a) estimated the proportion of toddlers meeting individual and combined movement guidelines; and b) examined associations between parental perceptions/practices and toddlers' compliance with movement guidelines. Cross-sectional study. Australian parents self-reported their parenting practices/perceptions (routines, co-participation, restrictions, concerns, knowledge) and toddlers' movement behaviours in the baseline assessment of Let's Grow (n=1145), a randomised controlled trial. The World Health Organization's Guidelines on Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour, and Sleep for children under 5 years were used to estimate the prevalence of compliance with individual and combined movement guidelines. Logistic models assessed cross-sectional associations. The prevalence of meeting guidelines was 30.9% for screen time, 82.3% for sleep, 81.6% for physical activity, 20.1% for combined, and 2.1% meeting none. Parents' knowledge of the guidelines, fewer concerns and more favourable restrictions concerning movement behaviours were associated with greater compliance with individual and combined movement guidelines. Routines for screen time and for combined behaviours were associated with adherence to their respective guidelines. Less co-participation in screen time and more co-participation in physical activity were associated with greater compliance with the relevant guidelines. Given only 20% of toddlers met all guidelines, strategies early in life to establish healthy movement behaviours, especially screen time, are needed. Future studies could target the parental practices/perceptions identified in this study to support toddlers with optimal sleep and physical activity and reduced screen time.
