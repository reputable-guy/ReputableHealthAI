Study Title: The Administration of Resveratrol and Vitamin C Reduces Oxidative Stress in Postmenopausal Women-A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
In postmenopausal women, due to endocrine changes, there is an increase in oxidative stress (OS) that predisposes them to cardiovascular and metabolic alterations. Sixty-one percent of women in this stage require a primary therapeutic strategy to decrease OS. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol and vitamin C on OS in postmenopausal women. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Forty-six postmenopausal women with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR > 2.5) were included and divided into three treatment groups: group A: resveratrol,= 13; group B: resveratrol + vitamin C,= 15; and group C: vitamin C,= 14. Between before and after the antioxidants, group B showed a decrease of 33% in lipohydroperoxides (= 0.02), and malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased by 26% (= 0.0007), 32% (= 0.0001), and 38% (= 0.0001) in groups A-C, respectively. For protein damage, group B is the most representative, with a decrease of 39% (= 0.0001). For total antioxidant capacity (TAC), there were significant increases of 30% and 28% in groups B and C, respectively. For HOMA-IR, there were no significant differences among the study groups. Supplementation with this combination of antioxidants significantly decreases markers of OS in postmenopausal women. In addition, it increases TAC by up to 30%.
