Study Title: Levels of physical activity before and after stroke in relation to early cognitive function.

Study Summary:
Regular physical activity is widely recommended in the primary and secondary prevention of stroke. Physical activity may enhance cognitive performance after stroke, but cognitive impairments could also hinder a person to take part in physical activity. However, a majority of previous studies have not found any association between post-stroke cognitive impairments and a person's subsequent level of activity. In this explorative, longitudinal study, we describe the intraindividual change in physical activity from before to 6&#xa0;months after stroke, in relation to early screening of post-stroke cognitive impairments. Participants were recruited at 2 to 15&#xa0;days after stroke, and screened for cognitive impairments using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool. Information on pre-stroke physical activity was retrospectively collected at hospital admittance by physiotherapists. Post-stroke physical activity was evaluated after 6&#xa0;months. Of 49 participants included, 44 were followed up. The level of physical activity changed in more than half of all participants after stroke. Participants who were physically active 6&#xa0;months after stroke presented with significantly less cognitive impairments. These results highlight that many stroke survivors experience a change in their physical activity level following stroke, and that unimpaired cognition may be important for a stroke survivors' ability to be physically active.
