Study Title: Effects of Supplementation with Omega-3 and Omega-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Antioxidant Vitamins, Combined with High-Intensity Functional Training, on Exercise Performance and Body Composition: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a supplement rich in &#x3c9;-3 and &#x3c9;-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and antioxidant vitamins on physical performance and body composition following a period of high-intensity functional training (HIFT). Nineteen healthy young adults (nine males, ten females) underwent an 8-week HIFT program (3 days&#xb7;week) where they were randomized 1:1 into either the supplement group (SG)-= 10, receiving a 20 mL daily dose of a dietary cocktail formula (Neuroaspis&#x2122; PLP10) containing a mixture of &#x3c9;-3 and &#x3c9;-6 PUFAs (12,150 mg), vitamin A (0.6 mg), vitamin E (22 mg), and &#x3b3;-tocopherol (760 mg)-or the placebo group (PG)-= 9, receiving a 20 mL daily dose of virgin olive oil. Body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and muscle endurance were assessed before and after the training period. Body mass did not change, but muscle mass increased by 1.7 &#xb1; 1.9% or 0.40 &#xb1; 0.53 kg in the SG (= 0.021) and decreased by 1.2 &#xb1; 1.6% or 0.28 &#xb1; 0.43 kg (= 0.097) in the PG, compared with baseline. VOmax, vertical jump, squat 1RM, bench press 1RM, and muscle endurance increased similarly in both groups. The effects of HIFT on physical performance parameters, muscle damage, and inflammation indices were not affected by the supplementation. In conclusion, HIFT combined with high doses of &#x3c9;-3 and &#x3c9;-6 PUFAs and antioxidant vitamins resulted in a small but significant increase in muscle mass and fat reduction compared with HIFT alone.
