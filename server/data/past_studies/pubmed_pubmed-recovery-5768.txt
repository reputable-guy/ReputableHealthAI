Study Title: Sublingual sufentanil tablet system (SSTS) versus a single shot peri-nervous injection of ropivacaine for the management of postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty: a single-center randomized trial.

Study Summary:
For several years, ropivacaine has been the standard-of-care for establishing postoperative femoral nerve block in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) setting and is still widely in use but new approaches such as the patient-controlled administration of sublingual sufentanil tablets system (SSTS) seem to offer good clinical results. Our aim is to compare the SSTS to single shot peri-nervous injection of ropivacaine (single shot) after TKA in terms of effectiveness in pain management and of time to recovery. A total of 165 patients undergoing TKA were enrolled. Eighty-four patients were randomly allocated in the SSTS group and 81 patients in the single shot group. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate performance of Timed Up and Go test. Secondary objectives were to measure the length of stay, NRS pain scale, the adherence to the prescribed plan, the joint mobility, the frequency of rescue analgesic use, side effects and patients' satisfaction. Of all patients of the single shot group, 64 were withdrawn from the study as they unable to achieve pain control; only one patient was withdrawn from the SSTS group. Times for the "Timed Up and Go" test on the 3rd postoperative day were 8.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.6 and 11.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.6 in the SSTS group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;83) and single shot group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17), respectively (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). SSTS provides better pain management when compared to peri-nervous ropivacaine single shot injection after TKA.
