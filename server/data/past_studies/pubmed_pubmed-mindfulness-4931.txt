Study Title: Bridging Intention and Action for Employee Well-Being Using the Intentional Action (InAct) Process: Workshop-Lecture Series.

Study Summary:
Employee wellness programs can help manage stress and alleviate burnout. To pilot and disseminate the Intentional Action(InAct) concept for employee wellbeing. Five independent interactive workshop-lectures with an automated audience response system. Descriptive analysis of participant response data. Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;275): rated spirituality, physical environment and nutrition the most highly in contributing to their present well-being. Ninety-eight percent (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;269) of participants identified a focus area to work on. The well-being area most selected was Exercise, (35% n&#x2009;=&#x2009;95), however, other non-traditional areas, including Personal and Professional Development (18% n&#x2009;=&#x2009;48), Relationships and Communication (17% n&#x2009;=&#x2009;47), were selected, along with mind-body connection and mindful awareness (6% n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15 and n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16). The pilot engaged employees to reflect and set goals for their future well-being. Healthcare institutions implementing programs should consider a broad range of whole person strategies addressing employee well-being, which go beyond the traditional focus on exercise and nutrition.
