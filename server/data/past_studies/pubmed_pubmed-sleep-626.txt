Study Title: The effects of melatonin and magnesium in a novel supplement delivery system on sleep scores, body composition and metabolism in otherwise healthy individuals with sleep disturbances.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a novel dietary supplement, including melatonin and magnesium, delivered via coffee pods on sleep quality, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and body composition in individuals with poor sleep quality disturbances. Using a double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial, we recruited 35 participants to a 4-week intervention with both supplements (1.9&#x2009;mg melatonin&#x2009;+&#x2009;200&#x2009;mg elemental magnesium before sleep) and placebo conditions, considering a 7d washout period between treatments. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was applied, RMR (kcal) was measured using indirect calorimetry (canopy ventilated open-circuit system) and body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Decreases in PSQI and anger - hostility scores, as well as in energy intake and fat mass, were observed (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) for both conditions, from baseline to the end of each 4-week intervention. Differences between conditions were also observed for these parameters along with energy spent in activity, number of sedentary breaks, sleep efficiency, latency time, time in bed, total sleep time, awakening time, and movement index (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) favouring the supplement condition. However, the final PSQI questionnaire scores still indicated poor sleep quality on average (PSQI > 5), in both conditions, with no changes regarding RMR. A melatonin-magnesium supplement, in a coffee pod format, showed improvements in sleep quality in otherwise healthy individuals with sleep disturbances, however PSQI questionnaire scores still indicated poor quality on average (PSQI > 5).
