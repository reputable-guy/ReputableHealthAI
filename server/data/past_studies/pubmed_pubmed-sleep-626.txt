Study Title: Do changes in beliefs and behaviours moderate improvement in insomnia after acquired brain injury?

Study Summary:
Key mechanisms of change in cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in the general population encompass changing sleep-related beliefs and behaviours. In a population with acquired brain injury, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is effective as well, but little is known about the mechanisms of change. The aim of this study was to evaluate how changing sleep-related beliefs and behaviours were associated with improvement in insomnia following blended cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in a population with acquired brain injury. A secondary analysis was performed on data of a randomized-controlled trial, including 24 participants that received blended cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, and 24 participants that received treatment as usual. Results showed that following blended cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, significantly more participants improved on dysfunctional beliefs and sleep-related behaviours and this was associated to improvement in insomnia severity. For sleep-related behaviours, the association between improvement on behaviour and improvement on insomnia was significantly moderated by blended cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. However, the relation between dysfunctional beliefs and insomnia was not moderated by type of treatment. Similar results were found for acquired brain injury-adapted versions of the questionnaires in which up to half of the items were excluded as they could be regarded as not dysfunctional for people with acquired brain injury. These results show that improvement on insomnia severity is related to improvement in dysfunctional beliefs and behaviours, and cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia efficacy may be moderated by the improvement in behaviours in particular. A focus on these behaviours can enhance treatment efficacy, but caution is needed regarding the behaviours that may reflect adequate coping with the consequences of the acquired brain injury.
