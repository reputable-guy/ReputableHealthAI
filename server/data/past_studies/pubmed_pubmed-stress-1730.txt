Study Title: Effects of stress-related neuromodulators on amygdala and hippocampus resting state functional connectivity.

Study Summary:
The human stress response is characterized by increases in neuromodulators, including norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol. Both neuromodulators can enter the brain and affect neurofunctional responses. Two brain areas associated with stress are the amygdala and the hippocampus. The precise influence of NE and cortisol on the amygdala and hippocampal resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) is poorly understood. To investigate the influence of NE and cortisol on the amygdala and hippocampal RSFC. We recruited 165 participants who received 10 mg yohimbine and/or 10 mg hydrocortisone in a randomized, placebo-controlled design. With seed-based analyses, we compared RSFC of the hippocampus and amygdala separately between the three groups that received medication versus placebo. We found no differences between yohimbine and placebo condition or between hydrocortisone and placebo condition regarding amygdala or hippocampal FC. Compared with placebo, the yohimbine/hydrocortisone condition showed increased amygdala and hippocampal RSFC with the cerebellum. Also, they had increased hippocampal RSFC with the amygdala and cerebral white matter. The group with elevated NE and cortisol showed significantly increased RSFC between the amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum compared to placebo. These three brain areas are involved in associative learning and emotional memory, suggesting a critical role for this network in the human stress response. Our results show that NE and cortisol together may influence the strength of this association. Compared to placebo, we found no differences in the groups receiving only one medication, suggesting that increasing one neuromodulator alone may not induce differences in neurofunctional responses. The study procedure has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT04359147).
