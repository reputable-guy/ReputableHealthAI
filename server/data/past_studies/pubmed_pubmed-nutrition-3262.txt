Study Title: Impact of a Cooking Intervention on the Cooking Skills of Adult Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
To investigate the impact of the Nutrition and Culinary in the Kitchen (NCK) Program on the cooking skills of Brazilian individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A randomized controlled intervention study was performed, with intervention and control groups. The intervention group participated in weekly sessions of the NCK Program for six weeks (including two in-person practical cooking and three online cooking workshops). The cooking recipes were adapted by replacing high glycemic index ingredients with low and medium glycemic index alternatives. Of note, the recipes did not contain added sugars or sweeteners, were based on the use of fresh or minimally processed foods, herbs, and spices, and were sensorially tested by individuals with T2DM before use in the intervention. The study outcomes were participant score changes on the seven scales. A validated online instrument was administered to the control and intervention groups at baseline (T1) and post-intervention (T2). Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to assess the differences between the T1 and T2 parameters. Of the 60 individuals enrolled, 44 answered the questionnaire at both times. The findings revealed a 45.37% &#xb1; 93.57% increase in Knowledge of Cooking Terms in the intervention group, whereas the control group showed a 3.82% &#xb1; 16.17% reduction (= 0.008). There was an increase in all the other cooking skills and healthy eating scales from T1 to T2 in the intervention group, but the differences were not significant. The development of cooking skills can contribute to increasing culinary knowledge and the availability of time to cook at home. The results contribute to the planning of health actions aimed at individuals with DM2 through culinary interventions and public food and nutrition policies.
