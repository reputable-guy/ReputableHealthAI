Study Title: Video Education and Behavior Contract to Improve Outcomes After Renal Transplantation (VECTOR): A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Sub-optimal adherence to immunosuppressant medications reduces graft survival for kidney transplant recipients and adherence-enhancing interventions are resource and time intensive. We performed a multi-center randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of an electronically delivered intervention on adherence. Of 203 adult kidney transplant recipients who received a de novo kidney transplant n = 173 agreed to participate (intent-to-treat population) and were randomized to the intervention (video education plus behavior contract n = 91) or the control (standard education, n = 82). No significant differences were found between the groups for medication adherence measured by the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale, intrapatient variability in tacrolimus levels, time in therapeutic range for any immunosuppressant, knowledge, self-efficacy, QOL, or hospitalizations. Among a subgroup of 64 participants randomized to the intervention group who completed a post-intervention questionnaire, two-thirds (67%, n = 43) reported watching at least 80% of the videos and 58% (n = 37) completed the electronic goal setting exercise and adherence contract. An autonomous goal setting exercise and electronic behavioural contract added to standard of care did not improve any outcomes. Our findings reiterate that nonadherence in transplantation is a difficult multifactorial problem that simple solutions will not solve. Trial registration number NCT03540121.
