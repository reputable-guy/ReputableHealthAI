Study Title: The Diagnostic Efficiency and Safety of Transbronchial Lung Cryobiopsy Using 1.1-mm Cryoprobe in Diagnosing Interstitial Lung Disease.

Study Summary:
Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is increasingly used to diagnose interstitial lung disease (ILD). The 1.1-mm cryoprobe has recently been available in clinical practice. The diagnostic yield and safety of TBLC using a 1.1-mm cryoprobe need to be confirmed. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with suspected ILD and randomly assigned to 1.1-mm and 1.9-mm cryoprobe groups. The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield of multidisciplinary discussion. Secondary outcomes were sample quality and incidence of complications. The tension and stress effects during TBLC onto the target lobe caused by 1.1-mm and 1.9-mm cryoprobes were also evaluated using finite element analysis. A total of 224 patients were enrolled. No significant differences were observed in the diagnostic yield (80.4% vs. 79.5%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.845) and sample quality scores (5.73&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.64 vs. 5.66&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.77; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.324) between the 1.9-mm cryoprobe group and 1.1-mm cryoprobe group. The average surface areas of samples in 1.1-mm cryoprobe group were smaller, while no difference in sample weights was observed. A decreased incidence of moderate bleeding was found in the 1.1-mm cryoprobe group (17.0% vs. 6.2%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027), while there was no difference in the incidence of the pneumothorax, there was a trend to higher rate of pneumothorax in 1.1-mm group. In finite element analysis, the 1.1-mm cryoprobe required the largest tension and produced the largest stress. Compared with a 1.9-mm cryoprobe, there was no difference in specimen quality or diagnostic rate but smaller sample size with a 1.1-mm cryoprobe. There was a decreased risk of moderate bleeding, but a trend towards increased risk for pneumothorax with 1.1-mm cryoprobe. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04047667; registered August 4, 2019.
