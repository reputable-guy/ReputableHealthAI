Study Title: Characteristics influencing expected cognitive performance during hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes.

Study Summary:
Acute hypoglycaemia is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, there is limited understanding of the relationship between patients' expected cognitive difficulties and their objectively-measured deficits during non-severe hypoglycaemia. This report investigates demographic and clinical factors associated with the discrepancy between expected (i.e., self-evaluated) and measurable (i.e., neuropsychological) cognitive functions in patients with type 2 diabetes during acute non-severe hypoglycaemia. We performed an analysis of factors associated with the relationship between expected and measurable cognitive performance for data collected from a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;25). Patients attended two experimental visits during which we performed hyper-insulinaemic glucose clamping; (i) non-severe hypoglycaemic clamp (plasma glucose (PG): 3.1&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.3&#x202f;mmol/L) and (ii) normoglycaemic clamp (PG: 5.8&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.3&#x202f;mmol/L), as part of a double-blinded cross-over study. During hypoglycaemia, patients' expected cognitive performance was assessed with a visual analogue scale after which objective cognitive functions were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. We computed a global 'cognitive discrepancy' composite variable with score values on a scale between -10 and +10 using a novel statistical formula that creates a discrepancy score between subjective and objective cognition. Positive values reflect more expected than objectively-measured difficulties, while negative values reflect disproportionately more objectively-measured than expected cognitive difficulties. We used paired samples t-tests to compare degree of cognitive discrepancy between conditions of hypo- and normoglycaemia, while multiple regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the degree and direction of the cognitive discrepancy. The significance level for the analyses was p&#x202f;&#x2264;&#x202f;0.05 (two-tailed). Patients generally underestimated their cognitive abilities (M&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.6, SD&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.3) during hypoglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia (M&#x202f;=&#x202f;-1.0, SD&#x202f;=&#x202f;3.5) (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.2), t(23)&#x202f;=&#x202f;2.9, p&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.01. Underestimation of cognitive capacity during hypoglycaemia was more pronounced for patients with younger age (&#x3b2;&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.5, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.02), higher verbal IQ (&#x3b2;&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.5, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.03), and more hypoglycaemia-related shakiness (&#x3b2;&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.4, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.03). The modest sample size limits the generalizability of the findings. Patients with type 2 diabetes underestimated their cognitive abilities during non-severe hypoglycaemic states, especially those with younger age, higher IQ, and more hypoglycaemia-related shakiness. These patients may thus have excessive preoccupations with their cognitive difficulties in relation to cognitively challenging daily life situations.
