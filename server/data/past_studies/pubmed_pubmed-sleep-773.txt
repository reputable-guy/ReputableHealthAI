Study Title: Efficacy of a fish hydrolysate supplement on sleep quality: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbances are widespread in modern societies and linked to a variety of diseases, creating an urgent need for the development of products that help combat sleep difficulties. One suitable nutritional supplement may be a fish hydrolysate composed of low molecular weight peptides. This two-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study investigated the effect of a 4-week fish hydrolysate intervention on sleep in a healthy German population reporting poor sleep quality, assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Further sleep parameters were measured using an online diary and a wrist wearable device. Additionally, questionnaires related to stress, anxiety, depression, and well-being were evaluated and salivary cortisol and product satisfaction were assessed. The 4-week fish hydrolysate supplementation significantly improved subjective sleep quality measured with the PSQI-score (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.002). Moreover, individuals reported improvements in sleep efficacy and a reduction in sleep disturbances and daytime sleepiness during fish hydrolysate intake (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.013, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.046, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.004 respectively), but not during placebo phase (all p&#xa0;>&#xa0;.05). No significant intra-individual differences were found between fish hydrolysate and placebo supplementation (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;.05). Although no significant intra-individual differences were found between fish hydrolysate and placebo supplementation, the significant improvement in subjective sleep quality from baseline to treatment phase suggests that fish hydrolysate is a safe nutritional supplement to support individuals with self-reported sleep problems. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the Identifier NCT04983355.
