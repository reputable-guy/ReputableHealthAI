Study Title: The effect of a training program on adolescents'&#xa0;stress levels and healthy lifestyle behaviors during the Covid-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Adolescence is the period when people adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors and turn them into habits. Healthy lifestyle behaviors are a significant step toward&#xa0;a long and healthy life. This study investigated the effect of a training program on adolescents'&#xa0;stress levels and healthy lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This randomized controlled study was conducted between May and July 2021. The sample consisted of 100 adolescents living in a city in the south of Turkey. Participants were randomized into intervention and control groups using block randomization. The intervention group participated in an online (Zoom) training program consisting of two 45&#x2009;min sessions once a week for 8 weeks. Data were collected using the adolescent stress questionnaire (ASQ) and the adolescent lifestyle profile (ALP). The results showed that 73% (n: 73) of the participants had developed hygiene habits since the onset of the pandemic. However, the pandemic negatively affected participants'&#xa0;dietary habits (45%, n: 45), physical activity (70%, n: 70), coping mechanisms (68%, n: 68), sleep patterns (54%, n: 54), Internet/social media/video game addiction (64%, n: 64), and interpersonal relationships (57%, n: 57). The intervention group had a lower mean ASQ posttest score and a higher mean ALP posttest score than the control group. The intervention group had a lower mean ASQ posttest score than their pretest score. The intervention group also had a higher mean ALP posttest score than their pretest score. The training program helped adolescents feel less stress and adopt more healthy lifestyle behaviors. Pediatric nurses should identify risk factors and design and implement appropriate plans to help adolescents go through future pandemics with as little damage as possible. Parents and educators should support adolescents against the adverse impacts of events such as the COVID 19 pandemic.
