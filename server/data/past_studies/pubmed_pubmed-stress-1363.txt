Study Title: Management of triggering factor effects in sensitive skin syndrome with a dermo-cosmetic product.

Study Summary:
Environmental factors are important in the generation or aggravation of sensitive skin syndrome (SSS). Creams can be useful for patients with SSS, particularly when triggering factors cannot be avoided. Several clinical studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of specific creams in patients with SSS, but the majority were assessed with a single type of triggering factor and were non-comparative. Therefore, this study's aim was to investigate, the benefit of a specific dermo-cosmetic product in response to physical and chemical factors in subjects with SSS. Three clinical studies were performed on subjects presenting SSS. The physical impact was assessed in a stripping test, and in a randomized intra-individual study with a newly developed heat-cold stress model. To assess chemical factors, a capsaicin test on the nasolabial fold was performed. The product significantly reduced the increase in skin microcirculation caused by stripping after 30&#x2009;min versus. The untreated condition (45.8% vs. 62.0%; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Immediately and at D28, the product induced a significant increase in skin hydration even after a heat-cold stress, while the overall score of unpleasant symptoms significantly decreased compared with the control (8.1 vs. 10.7 and 3.7 vs. 8.0, respectively; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Regarding chemical factors, a significant difference in the sensation intensity (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) was observed after capsaicin stress, also in terms of the sensation duration due to the product application versus the control (192&#x2009;s vs. 403&#x2009;s; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). These studies show that topical application of a dermo-cosmetic product can prevent unpleasant symptoms and improve the skin state in SSS exposed to physical and chemical triggering factors.
