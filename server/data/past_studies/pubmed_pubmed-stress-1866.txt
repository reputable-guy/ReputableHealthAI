Study Title: A lifestyle physical activity intervention for women in alcohol treatment: A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Compared to men, women with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are more likely to drink to manage stress and negative affect. Given women's risk for poor drinking outcomes, it is critical to develop and test interventions that target these affective factors. Physical activity improves negative affect and has emerged as a promising adjunct to AUD treatment and, thus, may be especially valuable for women. Fifty women with AUD (49.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;12.0&#xa0;years of age) participated in either a 12-week telephone-delivered lifestyle physical activity plus Fitbit (LPA&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit) or a health education contact (HEC) control intervention following a partial hospital addictions treatment program. The study examined changes in drinking behaviors, mental health outcomes, and physical activity engagement post-intervention using both conventional test statistics and standard effect sizes. Higher rates of continuous abstinence during the 12-week period were observed in the LPA&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit condition (55.6&#xa0;%) than in the HEC condition (33.6&#xa0;%); odds ratio&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.97. However, among women who drank any alcohol during the 12-weeks, slightly higher rates of heavy drinking and drinks/day were observed among women in the LPA&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit condition. Significant differences for improved mental health outcomes (including depression, anxiety, negative affect, positive affect, perceived stress, and behavioral activation) and increased self-reported physical activity were consistently observed among participants in the LPA&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit condition, relative to HEC. The LPA&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit program had a positive impact on alcohol abstinence, mental health, and physical activity in adult women receiving treatment for AUD. Future research should continue to investigate the optimal implementation strategies, duration, and intensity of LPA interventions in the context of a fully-powered RCT.
