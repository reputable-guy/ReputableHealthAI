Study Title: Pandemic Planning, Response, and Recovery for Pediatricians: A Focus on Health Equity and Social Determinants of Health.

Study Summary:
This article summarizes how pediatricians may be uniquely positioned to mitigate the long-term trajectory of COVID-19 on the health and wellness of pediatric patients especially with regard to screening for social determinants of health that are recognized drivers of disparate health outcomes. Health inequities, that is, disproportionately deleterious health outcomes that affect marginalized populations, have been a major source of vulnerability in past public health emergencies and natural disasters. Recommendations are provided for pediatricians to collaborate with disaster planning networks and lead strategies for public health communication and community engagement in pediatric pandemic and disaster planning, response, and recovery efforts.
