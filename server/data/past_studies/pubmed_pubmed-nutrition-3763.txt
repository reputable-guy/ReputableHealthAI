Study Title: Comparison of normal saline and antiseptic solution effect on the early peristomal infection rates of patients with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes: A randomized double-blind study.

Study Summary:
This study's aim was to compare the efficacy of normal saline (NS) with that of antiseptic solution in early peristomal skin care after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement in terms of peristomal infection incidence. This was a randomized controlled double-blind study conducted at a university hospital between December 2019 and April 2021. All patients who underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. The study population consisted of 64 patients randomized to group 1: NS (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) and group 2: 0.1% polyhexamethylene biguanide and 0.1% betaine (PHMB-B; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;33). Daily peristomal skin care was performed for 7 days, starting 24&#x2009;h after insertion. Peristomal skin was evaluated by two blinded investigators before each dressing, and findings were recorded. Data analysis was performed with descriptive statistics; chi-square analysis; and exact, Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney U, and Cochran Q tests. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of peristomal infection rates (group 1: 12.9%, group 2: 9.07%; P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Redness increased from day 4 in group 1 and day 5 in group 2, and exudate increased from day 5 in both groups. There is a statistical difference in the number of patients between the days when redness and exudate appear and increase. Both NS and PHMB-B solutions can be preferred in peristomal care. However, NS may be the first choice for early peristomal care that does not show signs of infection, because it is not irritating and allergic and is cost-effective.
