Study Title: Perioperative Enteral Immunonutrition Support for the Immune Function and Intestinal Mucosal Barrier in Gastric Cancer Patients Undergoing Gastrectomy: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
The impact of perioperative immunonutrition on patients undergoing radical gastrectomy remains undetermined. This study aimed to assess the influence of enteral immunonutrition support on postoperative immune function and intestinal mucosal barrier function following radical gastrectomy, contrasting findings with a control group to furnish evidence for perioperative enteral nutrition support. In this prospective randomized trial, 65 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy between June 2022 and June 2023 were included. Participants were allocated to either the study group (receiving enteral immunonutrition) or the control group (not receiving enteral immunonutrition). We compared postoperative rehabilitation and complications between the groups, analyzed the intestinal mucosal barrier function markers on the 3rd and 7th postoperative days, and delved deeper into peripheral blood cell immunity, inflammation, and nutritional indicators. The cohort consisted of 30 patients in the study group and 35 in the control group, with no significant differences in demographic attributes between the two groups. On the 3rd postoperative day, the diamine oxidase, D-lactic acid, and endotoxin levels in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (= 0.029,= 0.044, and= 0.010, respectively). By the 7th postoperative day, these levels continued to be significantly diminished in the study group (= 0.013,= 0.033, and= 0.004, respectively). The times to first flatus (= 0.012) and first bowel movement (= 0.012) were significantly shorter in the study group. Moreover, postoperative complications in the study group were fewer than in the control group (= 0.039). On the 7th postoperative day, the study group had lower peripheral white blood cell (WBC) levels (= 0.020) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios (NLR) (= 0.031), but displayed elevated albumin levels (= 0.006). One month post-surgery, the CD4+T and CD8+T counts were significantly greater in the study group (= 0.003 and= 0.012, respectively). Correlation analyses indicated that NLR and complications were associated with endotoxin levels. Administering perioperative enteral immunonutrition enhances postoperative immune and intestinal mucosal barrier functions in patients undergoing radical gastrectomy. This effect leads to diminished inflammatory responses, a decreased rate of postoperative complications, and accelerated patient recovery.
