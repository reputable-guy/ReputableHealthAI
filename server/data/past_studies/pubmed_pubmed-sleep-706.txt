Study Title: Effects of oropharyngeal exercises on CPAP compliance: A prospective intervention study.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effects of oropharyngeal exercise on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea over a period of 6&#xa0;months. This study was conducted as a prospective, observational, and interventional investigation. A total of 70 patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea were randomly assigned to either the oropharyngeal exercise group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;44) or the sham-therapy group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26). The compliance of the enrolled patients with CPAP therapy was assessed at baseline, 3-month follow-up and 6-month follow-up. Objective sleep data, questionnaire and CPAP use time were collected over a half-year period (i.e., baseline, 6&#xa0;months, and 12&#xa0;months). The study found that the average use time of CPAP within one month was significantly longer in the oropharyngeal exercises group compared to the sham-therapy group at the 3-month assessment (5.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.2 vs 4.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;h per night; p=0.030), and much significantly longer at 6-months assessment (6.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.4 vs 4.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;h per night; p=0.001). Furthermore, the average use time of CPAP increased over time, with the oropharyngeal exercises group exhibiting a more pronounced growth from baseline to the six-month follow-up (4.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.0&#xa0;h per night to 6.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;h per night, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) compared to the sham-therapy group (4.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;h per night to 4.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;h per night, p=0.952). Additionally, the oropharyngeal exercise group demonstrated an improvement in the Epworth sleepiness scale compared to the sham-therapy group at the 3-month follow-up (6.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.0 vs 8.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.2; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), as well as decreased significantly at 6-month follow-up (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.032). CPAP adherence can be improved with oropharyngeal exercises therapy among moderate to severe OSA patients. Notably, the average duration of CPAP usage and reduction in daytime sleepiness were maintained even after six months of oropharyngeal exercise therapy.
