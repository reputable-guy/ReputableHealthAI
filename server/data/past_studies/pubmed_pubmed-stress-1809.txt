Study Title: The effects of a web-based 24-hour movement behavior lifestyle education program on mental health and psychological well-being in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Compared with parents of neurotypical children or children diagnosed with other disabilities, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience poorer mental health, greater stress, and more depression and anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to assess the effects of a web-based 24-h movement behavior lifestyle education program on mental health and psychological well-being in parents of children with ASD. This study employed a randomized controlled trial utilizing the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) as a theoretical framework. A total of 318 parents of children with ASD were enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received an 8-week web-based 24-h movement behavior lifestyle education program, while the control group followed their usual routine. Two instruments, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), were used to measure mental health and psychological well-being, respectively. The data were collected at two time points-at the beginning and the end of the intervention. Compared with the baseline and control groups, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all outcome measures (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). There were significant differences in the DASS-21 and SWLS scores between the two groups before and after the intervention (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.01). This study represents the first randomized controlled trial involving a web-based 24-h movement behavior lifestyle education program specifically designed to address the mental health and psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD. The findings confirm the potential impact of 24-h movement behavior lifestyle education as a functional and effective strategy for parents of children with ASD.
