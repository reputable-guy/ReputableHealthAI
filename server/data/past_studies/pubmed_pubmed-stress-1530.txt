Study Title: "I'm here. We're here. My people and I exist": Exploring the psychopolitical experiences of Black immigrant college students attending predominantly White institutions.

Study Summary:
Despite the ever-growing presence of Black immigrant college students in the United States, little is known about their unique campus experiences or their mental health outcomes as it relates to psychopolitical determinants of well-being. This qualitative study aimed to explore the unique psychopolitical experiences of 14, first- and second-generation Black immigrant college students attending predominately White institutions in the United States. Using the theoretical frameworks of critical race theory, intersectionality, and psychopolitical validity to guide our study, a phenomenological approach uncovered six themes and 11 subthemes: (1) collective well-being, (2) relational well-being, (3) individual well-being (purpose; health and wellness; critical consciousness), (4) collective suffering (neocolonialism, oppressive policies, and political violence; institutional oppression; barriers to mental health care), (5) relational suffering (implicit racial bias, stereotypes, and microaggressions; violence and brutality), and (6) individual suffering (ethno-racial trauma; isolation; school-related stress). We highlight implications for practitioners working with Black immigrant college students such as providing culturally responsive mental health care and advocating for decolonized and antiracist trainings at predominately White institutions.
