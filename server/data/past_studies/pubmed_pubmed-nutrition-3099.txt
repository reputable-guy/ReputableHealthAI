Study Title: Prevention of allergies and infections by minimally processed milk in infants-The MARTHA feasibility and safety trial.

Study Summary:
Consumption of raw cow's milk has repeatedly been shown to protect from asthma, allergies, and respiratory infections. As raw milk bears potential health hazards, it cannot be recommended for prevention. Therefore, we performed an intervention study with microbially safe but otherwise minimally processed cow's milk. Here we describe feasibility and safety of the trial. The MARTHA trial (DRKS00014781) was set up as a double-blind randomized intervention in a population residing in Bavaria. Infants from 6 to 36&#x2009;months of age consumed minimally processed cow's milk (intervention arm) or ultra-heat-treated (UHT) semi-skimmed milk (comparator arm). At the age of 6 to 12&#x2009;months, 260 infants were enrolled, with 72% having a family history of atopy. The extensive screening system for milk consumption and symptoms suggestive of adverse events was well accepted with 22,988 completed weekly surveys and an average completion of 82% surveys sent out. The children consumed the study milk on average on 457&#x2009;days (61% of intervention days). The intervention proved to be safe without any case of milk allergy or milk intolerance under the intervention in both arms. All 6 cases of serious adverse events were unrelated to milk. The most common reason was unscheduled hospitalization of more than 3&#x2009;days. The intervention with minimally processed milk and the study instruments proved feasible. During the age of 6 to 36&#x2009;months, there was no increased risk of milk allergy in a population with a substantial proportion of family history of atopy.
