Study Title: Quality evaluation of nutrition policies in early childhood education and care services in Nerang, QLD.

Study Summary:
Food environments in early childhood, such as early childhood education and care services, influence the development of dietary patterns and behaviours that traverse into adulthood, where they affect health and longevity. Nutrition policies are mandatory in early childhood education and care services in Australia and can positively or negatively shape the food environment. However, the quality of such nutrition policies is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the comprehensiveness and strength of nutrition policies of early childhood education and care services among services participating in a university-community alliance in South East Queensland. Early childhood education and care services (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12) in Nerang, Queensland, Australia, participated in a cross-sectional study evaluating the comprehensiveness and strength of nutrition policies across four domains (Nutrition Education, Nutrition Standards, Promoting Healthy Eating and Communication and Evaluation) of the Wellness in Child Care Assessment Tool. Nutrition policies evaluated in this study had median total comprehensiveness scores of 55 (out of 100) and median total strength scores of 19 (out of 100). 'Nutrition Education' had the highest median scores for comprehensiveness (67 out of 100) and strength (33 out of 100), while 'Nutrition Standards' had the lowest comprehensiveness score (41 out of 100), and 'Communication and Evaluation' had the lowest strength score (0 out of 100). All services have a nutrition policy, but there are opportunities to enhance both the content and linguistic strength of statements within policies related to nutrition domains. SO WHAT?: There is a clear need to improve the comprehensiveness and strength of written statements in nutrition policies across all four domains, particularly 'Nutrition Standards' and 'Communication and Evaluation'.
