Study Title: Intravenous Albumin Infusion Does not Augment the Response Rate to a Combination of Exclusive Enteral Nutrition and Intravenous Steroids in Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis: A Randomised Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Overall, 30-40% patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis [ASUC] fail intravenous [IV] steroids, requiring medical rescue therapy/colectomy. Low baseline albumin predicts steroid non-response, and exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN] has been shown to improve steroid response and albumin levels. Albumin infusion, due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, might further improve steroid response in ASUC, which was evaluated in the present study. In this open-label, randomised, controlled trial, patients with ASUC were randomised in 1:1 ratio to either albumin&#x2005;+&#x2005;standard of care [SOC]&#x2005;+&#x2005;EEN [Albumin arm] or SOC&#x2005;+&#x2005;EEN [SOC arm], over January 2021-February 2023. Both arms received 5 days of EEN with 400 mg IV hydrocortisone/day. Patients in the Albumin arm were administered 5 days of 20% weight/volume [w/v] intravenous albumin [100 ml]. Primary outcome was first, steroid failure [need for rescue medical therapy or colectomy] and second, proportion of patients with adverse events. In all, 61 patients [albumin: 30, SOC: 31][mean age 31.6&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;0.4 years, male 57.4%], were included. Baseline characteristics were comparable. There was no difference in steroid failure between Albumin and SOC arms (10/30 [33.33%] vs 13/31[41.94%], p&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.49). No adverse events were reported with albumin infusions. Colectomy rate [10% vs 9.68%, p&#x2005;=&#x2005;1], response to salvage medical therapy [88.89% vs 76.92%, p&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.62] and median [interquartile range] duration of hospitalisation [10.5 [7-16] vs 10 [7-20], p&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.43] were also comparable. The long-term composite outcome of colectomy and re-admission rates was numerically higher in the Albumin than the SOC arm [37.04% vs 17.86%, p&#x2005;>&#x2005;0.05], although this did not reach statistical significance. There was no benefit of intravenous albumin infusion as an adjunct to IV steroids and EEN in patients with ASUC.
