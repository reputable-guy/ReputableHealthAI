Study Title: Effectiveness of a novel diet in attenuation of clinical activity of disease in patients with ulcerative colitis: a randomized, clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Dietary intake plays a pivotal role in ulcerative colitis (UC) initiation and prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a combined Mediterranean, low-FODMAP diet accompanied with partial enteral nutrition (PEN) on clinical and para-clinical characteristics of patients with UC. Fifty patients with active mild to moderate UC were received either a combined diet or a regular diet for 6&#xa0;weeks. Before and after the intervention, disease activity index, quality of life and some inflammatory and oxidative stress factors were measured using valid and reliable questionnaires and blood sampling. Disease activity index was significantly decreased in the combined diet group in comparison to control diet group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043), and baseline data (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Moreover, the quality of life score increased significantly in the combined diet group compared to the control group, and the baseline data (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Serum level of high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) decreased significantly in the combined group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), while it increased in the control group non-significantly. Serum total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) changes were not statistically significant in two groups. This study indicates that this combination diet has the potential to be used as a safe and highly effective approach in patients with significant intestinal symptoms. Further clinical trial studies with different duration of intervention are needed to confirm these results.Trial registration: The study was registered on IRCT.ir with registration number of IRCT20100524004010N38, on 25/04/2023.
