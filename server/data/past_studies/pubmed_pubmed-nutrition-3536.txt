Study Title: Evaluation of School Wellness Policies in Low-Income California Districts After the 2016 USDA Final Rule.

Study Summary:
Districts with federal nutrition programs must have an updated local school wellness policy (LSWP) to promote nutrition, physical activity, and student wellness. This study evaluates factors associated with LSWP quality among low-income districts. In 2018, we collected LSWPs from websites of 200 randomly selected, county-stratified, low-income-serving California public districts. Multivariable linear regression assessed associations between district characteristics, model LSWP use (national, state, none), and adoption date on policy quality. On the WellSAT 3.0 scale of 0-100, mean (95% CI) comprehensiveness was 65.0 (63.2-66.7) and strength was 37.3 (35.3-39.2). Nearly verbatim adoption of model LSWPs was high&#xa0;(68.5% state model, 13.0% a national model). Half were adopted before mandated updates. District size (&#x2265;1000 students) and national model LSWP adoption were associated with higher comprehensive scores. National model LSWP adoption was associated with higher strength scores in updated policies compared with those not updated. LSWPs have improved school food and activity environments, but district engagement in LSWP is low. Integration into education frameworks that reduce learning barriers could provide synergy for re-engagement. High adoption of model policies and low update compliance indicate little district engagement in LSWP. Mixed methods studies of districts with high-quality LSWP are needed.
