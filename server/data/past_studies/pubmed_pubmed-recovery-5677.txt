Study Title: No Effect of Interset Palm Cooling on Acute Bench Press Performance, Neuromuscular or Metabolic Responses, Following Moderate-Intensity Resistance Exercise.

Study Summary:
McMahon, G. No effect of interset palm cooling on acute bench press performance, neuromuscular or metabolic responses, following moderate-intensity resistance exercise. J Strength Cond Res 38(7): 1213-1220, 2024-Despite the growing literature in high-intensity exercise regarding palm cooling, the acute effects of palm cooling on exercise performance indices, neuromuscular and metabolic responses, have not been described during moderate-intensity resistance exercise. Nine (age, 22 &#xb1; 1 year; mass, 80.8 &#xb1; 16.2 kg; height, 1.80 &#xb1; 0.11 m) healthy, male (n = 7) and female (n = 2) resistance-trained subjects performed 4 sets of bench press to failure at 60% 1 repetition maximum with 3-minute passive recovery. Subjects were randomly allocated to either the cooling (COL; 2 minutes of cooling at 10 &#xb0;C) or the control (passive rest; CON) condition separated by 1 week between the conditions. Exercise performance (volume load, repetitions, barbell velocity), muscle activation, blood lactate, and rate of perceived exertion were assessed. Despite changes across the variables during the resistance exercise sessions, there were no statistical differences (p > 0.05) in any of the performance, neuromuscular or physiological responses, between the 2 experimental conditions, despite palm temperature being significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in the cooling condition compared with control throughout. Therefore, based on the results of this study, palm cooling does not enhance acute moderate-intensity resistance exercise.
