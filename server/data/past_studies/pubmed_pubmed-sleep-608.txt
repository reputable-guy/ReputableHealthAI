Study Title: Effects of mind-regulating acupuncture on pain, negative emotion and sleep quality in patients with postherpetic neuralgia&#xff1a; a randomized controlled pilot trial.

Study Summary:
To observe the effect of mind-regulating acupuncture on pain intensity, sleep quality, negative emotion in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and evaluate the clinical effect of mind-regulating acupuncture combined with surrounding needling and heavy moxibustion atpoints (Extra) in treatment of PHN. The patients with PHN were randomly divided into a control group (35 cases, 2 cases dropped out) and a comprehensive therapy group (35 cases). The patients in the control group were treated with surrounding needling and heavy moxibustion atpoints. In the comprehensive therapy group, the mind-regulating acupuncture therapy was delivered besides the treatment as the control group. The treatment was given once daily, one course of treatment was composed of 6 days and 2 courses were required in the 2 groups. Before and after treatment, the pain conditions were assessed using pain rating index (PRI), visual analogue scale (VAS) and present pain intensity (PPI), the negative emotions were assessed using Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), and the sleep quality with Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). One week before and one week after treatment, the average sleep time was recorded. The therapeutic effect of 2 groups was evaluated. The effective cases of 2 groups were followed up in 2 months after treatment completion and the recurrence of neuralgia was recorded. There were no statistical differences in the above indicators between the 2 groups before treatment. After 2 courses of treatment, the scores of PRI, VAS, PPI, HAMA, HAMD and PSQI were reduced when compared with those before treatment in the patients of the 2 groups (0.05), and the average sleep time was increased (0.05). The scores of PRI, VAS, PPI, HAMA, HAMD and PSQI in the comprehensive therapy group, as well as the average sleep time were all improved when compared with those of the control group (0.05). The total effective rate in the comprehensive therapy group (34/35, 97.14%) was higher than that of the control group (27/33, 81.82%,0.05) and the recurrence rate was lower (&#xff3b;2/34, 5.88%&#xff3d;&#xff3b;8/27, 29.63%&#xff3d;,<0.05). The combination of mind-regulating acupuncture with surrounding needling and heavy moxibustion atacupoint can effectively relieve PHN. Compared with the traditional surrounding acupuncture in pain area combined with moxibustion at Ashi points, this comprehensive therapy is more effective for ameliorating pain intensity, improving sleep quality and reducing negative emotions. It is also effective for declining the recurrence.
