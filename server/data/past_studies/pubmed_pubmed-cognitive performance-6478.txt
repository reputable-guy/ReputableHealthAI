Study Title: Effects of Morning Blue-Green 500&#x200a;nm Light Therapy on Cognition and Biomarkers in Middle-Aged and Older Adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline and Mild Cognitive Impairment: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Given that there is no specific drug to treat Alzheimer's disease, non-pharmacologic interventions in people with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are one of the most important treatment strategies. To clarify the efficacy of blue-green (500&#x200a;nm) light therapy on sleep, mood, and physiological parameters in patients with SCD and aMCI is an interesting avenue to explore. This is a monocentric, randomized, and controlled trial that will last for 4 weeks. We will recruit 150 individuals aged 45 years or older from memory clinics and divide them into 5 groups: SCD treatment (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;30), SCD control (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;30), aMCI treatment (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;30), aMCI control (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;30), and a group of healthy adult subjects (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;30) as a normal control (NC). The primary outcome is the change in subjective and objective cognitive performance between baseline and postintervention visits (4 weeks after baseline). Secondary outcomes include changes in performance assessing from baseline, postintervention to follow-up (3 months after the intervention), as well as sleep, mood, and physiological parameters (including blood, urine, electrophysiology, and neuroimaging biomarkers). This study aims to provide evidence of the impact of light therapy on subjective and objective cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults with SCD or aMCI. In addition, we will identify possible neurophysiological mechanisms of action underlying light therapy. Overall, this trial will contribute to the establishment of light therapy in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
