Study Title: Comparison of intranasal ketamine with intranasal midazolam and dexmedetomidine combination in pediatric dental patients for procedural sedation: A crossover study.

Study Summary:
The main goal of the pediatric dentist is to address and reduce children's fear and anxiety during the dental treatment, especially when conventional behavior-guiding strategies fail. In such cases, the use of pharmacological agents becomes an essential factor to consider. The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of intranasal ketamine (INK) with the combination of intranasal midazolam and dexmedetomidine (INMzD) in pediatric dental patients for the procedural sedation. Forty-seven children aged 3-9 years who required dental procedures such as extractions, pulpectomy, and restorations were randomly distributed into two groups using the envelope drawing method. Group INK received 7 mg/kg INK, whereas Group INMzD received a combination of midazolam spray (0.3 mg/kg) and atomized dexmedetomidine (3 &#x3bc;g/kg). INK showed faster onset, faster recovery, and shorter discharge time than INMzD. Both groups had acceptable physiological parameters and no postoperative complications. INK was more accepted by the patients than INMzD. In terms of efficacy, safety, and acceptability, INK outperformed the combination of INMzD for the procedural sedation.
