Study Title: Wellness Perception of South Korean Elementary School Students during the COVID-19 Endemic.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to analyze health management awareness among South Korean elementary school students in COVID-19 endemic areas. Using convenience sampling, 675 South Korean elementary school students (age 11-12 years old) were selected as participants in July 2023. Data for the study were collected via online and offline surveys between July and August 2023. The collected data were subjected to frequency, reliability, and multicollinearity analyses, independent sample-tests, and importance-performance analysis (IPA). The findings indicated the following: (1) There was no significant difference in health management performance between male and female children. (2) Children who had not experienced COVID-19 infection, had a higher level of "hygiene management" performance. (3) Among children who did not wear masks during physical activity, "mental health management" and "physical activity management" performance were higher, while "hygiene management" performance was lower. (4) The IPA matrix analysis revealed that, compared to the COVID-19 pandemic period, "physical activity management", "dietary habit management", and "sleep management" still required improvement, while "hygiene management" and "disease management" appeared to have decreased due to the relaxation of epidemic control efforts. As per the study's findings, schools, local communities, and families should make efforts to develop and implement preventive and individualized health management programs that consider the individual characteristics of their children.
