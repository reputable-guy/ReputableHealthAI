Study Title: Intraoperative Enteral Nutrition Feeding in Free-Flap Healing after Reconstruction Surgery for Head and Neck Cancers.

Study Summary:
To investigate the beneficial outcomes of intraoperative enteral feeding in free-flap regeneration after extended head and&#xa0;neck cancer resection and flap reconstruction surgery. A pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Single tertiary care center. Patients with advanced head and&#xa0;neck cancers requiring radical tumor resections and free-flap reconstruction were randomly assigned to receive intraoperative enteral nutrition feeding (100&#x2009;kcal/100&#x2009;mL&#xa0;at 10-20&#x2009;mL/h) via a nasogastric tube during free-flap reconstruction (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28) or continue fasting (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28). The primary outcome was impaired free-flap regeneration that required surgical reintervention within 90 days after the operation. Participants were enrolled between April 2020 and January 2022; the 90-day follow-up ended in April 2022. The incidence of total or partial flap failure was similar between the 2 groups (14.2% or n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4 in each group), but the rate of wound dehiscence or edge necrosis was significantly reduced in the feeding group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6 vs 0 for fasting vs feeding; absolute risk reduction, 25.0% [95% confidence interval, 6.9-43.0]%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022). Hospital stay length was shorter (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) and hand grip strength was better preserved (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025) in the feeding group. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 after the operation increased significantly more in the fasting group. Perioperative adverse events did not differ between the 2 groups. Perioperative enteral feeding is a simple, safe, and effective approach to improve perioperative systemic catabolism and proinflammatory reactions, thereby enhancing early wound regeneration after major operations.
