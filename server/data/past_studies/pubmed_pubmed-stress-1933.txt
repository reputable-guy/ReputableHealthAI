Study Title: A peer mentoring program for Chinese American dementia caregivers: a pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
A large gap exists in the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce stress related to dementia care among Chinese Americans, one of the fastest growing minority populations in the United States. We developed and pilot tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a peer mentoring program for Chinese American dementia caregivers. A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted among 38 Chinese American caregivers in New York City. Four outcome variables-caregiving competence, loneliness, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms-were measured at baseline and 3-month and 9-month follow-ups. The study protocol and preliminary results are available at clinicltrial.gov [NCT04346745]. The feasibility of the intervention was high, as indicated by an acceptable retention rate, fidelity, and positive feedback from caregivers and mentors. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had greater reductions in scores for loneliness at 3-month follow-up and for caregiver burden and depressive symptoms at 9-month follow-up. We did not find significant differences in caregiving competence between the two groups. The results indicated the high feasibility and potential efficacy of empowering existing human resources of experienced caregivers in the same ethnic community to improve the mental health of Chinese caregivers. Further research is needed to test the efficacy in a larger sample of this population.
