Study Title: Effects of Phenylcapsaicin on Intraocular and Ocular Perfusion Pressure During a 30-Min Cycling Task: A Placebo-Controlled, Triple-Blind, Balanced Crossover Study.

Study Summary:
The main objective of this placebo-controlled, triple-blind, balanced crossover study was to assess the acute effects of phenylcapsaicin (PC) intake (2.5&#xa0;mg) on intraocular pressure (IOP), ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), and heart rate (HR) during a 30-min cycling task performed at 15% of the individual maximal power. Twenty-two healthy young adults performed the cycling task 45&#xa0;min after ingesting PC or placebo. IOP was measured with a rebound tonometer before exercise, during cycling (every 6&#xa0;min), and after 5 and 10&#xa0;min of recovery. OPP was assessed before and after exercise. HR was monitored throughout the cycling task. We found an acute increase of IOP levels related to PC consumption while cycling (mean difference = 1.91 &#xb1; 2.24&#xa0;mmHg; p = .007, &#x3b7;p2=.30), whereas no differences were observed for OPP levels between the PC and placebo conditions (mean difference = 1.33 &#xb1; 8.70&#xa0;mmHg; p = .608). Mean HR values were higher after PC in comparison with placebo intake (mean difference = 3.11 &#xb1; 15.87 bpm, p = .019, &#x3b7;p2=.24), whereas maximum HR did not differ between both experimental conditions (p = .199). These findings suggest that PC intake before exercise should be avoided when reducing IOP levels is desired (e.g.,&#xa0;glaucoma patients or those at risk). Future studies should determine the effects of different ergogenic aids on IOP and OPP levels with other exercise configurations and in the long term.
