Study Title: Effectiveness of an affect-adjusted, supervised, multimodal, online and home-based exercise group protocol for major depression: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of an affect-adjusted, supervised, multimodal, online, and home-based exercise group protocol as an adjunct therapy to antidepressants on depressive symptoms, cardiorespiratory fitness, and side effects related to antidepressants in adults with major depression (MDD, diagnosed by a clinician). Depressive symptom scales were administered by a psychiatrist and self-reported. A health-related measure (i.e., cardiorespiratory fitness), was also administered. The exercise intervention was adjusted by perceived effort and affect (pleasure and enjoyment) toward exercise and lasted 12 weeks. In total, 59 adults with MDD were divided into two groups: the exercise-group (EG; exercise&#xa0;+&#xa0;pharmacotherapy) with 26-patients (76.9&#xa0;% females, mean age 28.5 years) and the control-group (CG, pharmacotherapy) with 33-patients (78.7&#xa0;% females, mean age 25.6 years). The EG had a lower dropout rate (15.3&#xa0;%) than CG and an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which was not observed in the CG. Both groups showed a decrease in self-reported depressive symptoms. However, the EG had significantly lower depressive symptom scores at t1 and t2. The EG also had higher remission rates (t1, EG:&#xa0;=&#xa0;42.3&#xa0;% and CG&#xa0;=&#xa0;27.2&#xa0;%) and remission rates (t2, EG:&#xa0;=&#xa0;72.7&#xa0;% and CG&#xa0;=&#xa0;48.1&#xa0;%) than CG, which were maintained during the four month follow-up. Side effects from anti-depressant medication were larger in the EG compared to CG. Complementing usual care for MDD with exercise resulted in better clinical outcomes and supports the use of this type of exercise protocol in the clinical management of depression.
