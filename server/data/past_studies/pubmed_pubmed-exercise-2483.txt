Study Title: Comparing the Effects of Aqua- and Land-Based Active Cooldown Exercises on Muscle Soreness and Sport Performance: A Randomized Crossover Study.

Study Summary:
Limited research has directly compared the effectiveness of aqua-&#xa0;and land-based exercises for postexercise recovery. This study aimed to fill this gap by comparing the effects of these 2 types of exercises on postexercise recovery. Sixteen male college athletes participated in an 8-day experimental study. The initial 2&#xa0;days were dedicated to determining the intensity levels for the muscle-damaging exercise and recovery jogging. In a crossover design, participants underwent 2 sets of experimental trials. They were randomly assigned to either an aqua or land recovery intervention for days 3 to 5, and after a 1-week washout period they switched to the opposite intervention for days 6 to 8. Muscle soreness, creatine kinase, anaerobic performance, countermovement-jump height, and flexibility were assessed at different time points: baseline, immediately after downhill running, within 1&#xa0;hour after jogging, and 24&#xa0;hours and 48&#xa0;hours after aqua or land jogging. Significant group &#xd7; time interaction effects were detected in the perceived soreness of the hamstring and quadriceps. However, the post hoc analysis showed no significant difference between aqua and land jogging groups. No significant group &#xd7; time interaction effect was observed in creatine kinase, anaerobic performance, countermovement-jump height, or flexibility. Aqua and land jogging have similar recovery effects on muscle soreness and performance-based parameters.
