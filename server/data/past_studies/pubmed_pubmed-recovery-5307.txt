Study Title: Thematic analysis of patient perspectives in a randomized controlled trial for a remote perioperative telemonitoring program.

Study Summary:
Remote patient telemonitoring programs offer the potential to enhance access and communication with medical providers. This study assessed the patient-reported experience during perioperative telemonitoring for gastrointestinal (GI) oncologic surgery. Between October 2021 and July 2023, patients with GI cancer were enrolled in the remote telemonitoring trial and randomized into the intervention or enhanced usual care arm. Although the enhanced usual care arm adhered to standard protocols for problem reporting, the intervention arm received active nursing support for monitoring data deviations from predetermined thresholds. The program culminated in a 15-minute exit interview comprised 9 total questions to gather insights into the patient experiences with device usage, symptom reporting, and communication with the healthcare team. Thematic analysis was conducted on all responses to present a patient-centric summary. Of the 114 patients completing the study, 100 patients (88%) participated in the exit interview. Most enrolled patients (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;68) were diagnosed as having colorectal cancer. The intervention arm reported greater ease and accessibility in electronic data reporting and communication with healthcare team compared to the enhanced usual care arm (94% vs 69%). Qualitative analysis identified 3 themes used to describe the program: "instilling an affirmative and proactive mindset toward recovery," "receiving timely attention from healthcare team," and "benefits of device usage and electronic health surveys." The subthemes highlighted an appreciative and empowering mindset among most patients. Most enrolled patients expressed satisfaction with the program to facilitate their postoperative recovery. These positive testimonials present a promising outlook for future implementation from the patient perspective.
