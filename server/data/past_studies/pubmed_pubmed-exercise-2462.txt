Study Title: The effect of proprioceptive vestibular rehabilitation on sensory-motor symptoms and quality of life.

Study Summary:
&#x2003;Peripheral vestibular hypofunction (PVH) is characterized by balance and gait disorders and vestibulo-autonomic findings. The vestibular system and proprioceptive system work together to regulate sensorimotor functions. Vestibular exercises are effective in PVH, but their superiority over each other is still unclear. &#x2003;This study aims to examine the effect of proprioceptive vestibular exercises on patients with PVH. &#x2003;30 individuals with unilateral PVH were assigned to 3 groups. Group 1 received proprioceptive vestibular rehabilitation, group 2 received standard vestibular rehabilitation. Both groups were given standard vestibular exercises as home exercises. No exercise was applied to the group 3. Patients were evaluated in terms of balance, functional mobility, posture, sensory profile, and quality of life. &#x2003;Although there was a significant intra-group difference in balance, functional mobility, and quality of life results in all groups (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), the difference between groups was generally in favor of group 1 (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was a significant difference between the groups in the posture analysis results (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), while there was a significant difference in the 1st group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was a significant difference between the groups in the results of sensory sensitivity, sensory avoidance, and low recording (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in sensory-seeking results (&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). There was a significant difference in quality of life between and within groups (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). &#x2003;Proprioceptive vestibular rehabilitation is an effective method in PVH. We think that our study will guide clinicians and contribute to the literature. &#x2003;NCT04687371.
