Study Title: Mindfulness-based training effect on attention, impulsivity, and emotional regulation among children with ADHD: The role of family engagement in randomized controlled trials.

Study Summary:
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is among the most common psychiatric conditions affecting school-aged children, marked by diverse levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Mindfulness-based training intervention throughout childhood enhances those symptoms, improving emotional regulation and well-being, hence improving their quality of life. To investigate the effects of mindfulness-based training on attention, impulsivity, and emotional regulation among children diagnosed with ADHD. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was used to carry out this study. This study was conducted at the outpatient Medical National Institute in Damanhur. The subjects were 60 children and their parents for the control and study groups (30 in each group). Researchers used three tools to collect the necessary data: Tool I, A Socio-demographic and Academic Data Questionnaire; Tool II, the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (VADPRS); and Tool III, The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. The difference in the level of attention, impulsivity, and emotional regulation between the study and control groups after the mindfulness-based training intervention was statistically significant. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in improving inattention, impulsivity, and emotional regulation among children with ADHD and increasing their performance in all activities. Health care professionals should consider incorporating mindfulness-based techniques into standard treatment protocols for children with ADHD. Families should be educated about the benefits of mindfulness as family involvement appears to strengthen the effectiveness of these interventions. These programs should be accessible in schools, community centers, and therapeutic settings to guarantee general distribution. RCT: NCT06131190, Date: 11-9-2023.
