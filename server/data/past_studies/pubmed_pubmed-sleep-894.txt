Study Title: The effect of music on menopausal symptoms, sleep quality,and depression: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to determine the effect of music on menopausal symptoms, sleep quality, and depression levels in menopausal women. This randomized controlled study was carried out between August and December 2022. The study sample consisted of 61 menopausal women (intervention: 30 and control: 31). The intervention group listened to music twice a day for 5 weeks, with a total of 70 sessions. The control group received only routine care. Menopause symptoms, depression levels, and sleep quality were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the study using the Menopausal Symptoms Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. The post-test Menopausal Symptoms Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index scores of the menopausal women were found to be lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p=0.011, p=0.001, and p=0.006, respectively). When the pre-test and post-test mean scores were compared, the mean menopausal symptoms and depression levels decreased, and sleep quality increased significantly in the intervention group. No significant difference was observed in the control group. This study shows that music may have an effect on reducing the level of menopausal symptoms and depression levels and also increasing the sleep quality of menopausal women.
