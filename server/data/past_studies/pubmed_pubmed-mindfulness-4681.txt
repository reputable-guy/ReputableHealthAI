Study Title: A randomized pilot of eHealth mindful movement and breathing to improve gynecologic surgery outcomes.

Study Summary:
To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of eHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB) compared to an empathic attention control (AC). Women undergoing surgery for a suspected gynecologic malignancy. eMMB is a brief yoga intervention delivered remotely during the perioperative timeframe. We assessed feasibility and participants completed assessments (baseline, weeks 2 and 4 postoperatively). We summarized feasibility, participant characteristics, and outcomes by intervention group and time. Forty-three percent of eligible patients approached participated (&#x2009;=&#x2009;31). Adherence to the interventions was 77%. Percent of participants to complete outcomes was 81% at Week 2 and 84% at Week 4 (>70%; retention was the primary feasibility indicator). Average reductions in the primary outcome of pain intensity were larger in the eMMB group than AC group (Week 2= -0.38; Week 4= -0.46). This pilot study of eMMB supported feasibility and improvements in pain intensity that warrant a future efficacy study.
