The data were collected using the Patient Sociodemographic and Medical Data Form and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (SpWB) (FACIT-Sp Version 4). In the statistical analysis, the independent sample t test and paired sample t test were used to examine the intervention effect on primary and secondary outcomes, according to numbers, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and conformity to normal distribution. The average age of the therapy group was 42.22 &#xb1; 6.86, and the control group was 41.64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009; 6.04.
