Study Title: How to cultivate sustainable physical health and wellness in transplant recipients: the emerging and enduring role of exercise scientists.

Study Summary:
The aim of the current review is to highlight the importance of exercise training as an important section of transplant recipient rehabilitation process and explain the role of the exercise scientist in the development, implementation, and assessment of the exercise regime. Transplant patients face a unique set of challenges in their recovery and rehabilitation process, often requiring a multifaceted approach to address the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of their condition. Exercise training has emerged as a crucial component in the care of these patients, providing a means to improve functional capacity, enhance quality of life, and mitigate the adverse effects of transplant-related complications. Exercise scientists who are trained to assess patient's physical limitations, develop and deliver personalized exercise programs, and monitor their progress are uniquely positioned to play a crucial role in the treatment of patients with chronic conditions that require exercise training as a mean of improving and maintaining health and quality of life. Exercise scientists are the appropriate professionals for providing transplant recipients with the recommended exercise training for maintaining and improving their health status as part of the overall plan of long-term care and support.
