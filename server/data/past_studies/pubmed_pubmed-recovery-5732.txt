Study Title: Dietary supplement use among military personnel: international patterns and motivations for use.

Study Summary:
Dietary supplements, products that contain one or more dietary ingredients, or their components, typically in a concentrated form, are often consumed for purported health and performance benefits. The frequency, forms and motivations for dietary supplement use may differ between civilian and military populations. The objective of this manuscript is to review patterns and trends in dietary supplement use in military personnel from the USA, France, the UK and Slovenia. Main findings indicate that dietary supplement use may be higher in military personnel as compared with civilian populations. Factors motivating dietary supplement use in military personnel include physical and cognitive performance, recovery, and the maintenance of body weight and composition, whereas civilian populations tend to be motivated by health and wellness. Commonly used dietary supplements in military populations, such as proteins and amino acids, may be associated with performance, body weight management and body composition. The relationship between dietary supplement use and the frequency and severity of adverse events, along with the potential benefits of dietary supplements, has not been carefully assessed in military populations and should be the focus of future studies.
