Study Title: Effects of Supplementing Zinc Magnesium Aspartate on Sleep Quality and Submaximal Weightlifting Performance, following Two Consecutive Nights of Partial Sleep Deprivation.

Study Summary:
We examined whether supplementation of zinc magnesium aspartate (ZMA), while partially sleep deprived, was beneficial to sleep quality and subsequent morning (07:00 h) submaximal weightlifting.Using a double-blinded, randomized counterbalanced design, sixteen trained males were recruited and completed six sessions: (i) one repetition max (1 RM) for bench press and back squat; (ii) two familiarisation sessions; (iii) three conditions with 4 h sleep and either: ZMA, placebo (PLA), or NoPill control (NoPill). Submaximal exercise session consisted of three repetitions at 40, 60 and 80% of 1 RM for bench press and back squat. Average power (AP), average velocity (AV), peak velocity (PV), displacement (D) and time-to-peak velocity (tPV) were recorded using MuscleLab linear encoders. Data were analysed using a general linear model with repeated measures and linear correlation.No significant main effect for condition was found for performance values or subjective ratings of fatigue. Main effect for "load" on the bar was found, where AP and tPV values increased with load (< 0.05). No significant relationship between dose of zinc or magnesium ingested and change in performance for 80% 1 RM power-outputs was found.Supplementation of ZMA for two nights of partial sleep deprivation had no effect on sleep or subsequent morning performance.
