Study Title: A brief online mindfulness induction improves creative art-making.

Study Summary:
Prior research has suggested that mindfulness may enhance people's memory for art, although results have been mixed. Mindfulness may also be beneficial for some art-making tasks. Here we examine the effects of a short mindfulness (vs. control) induction administered online at different times in the procedure (i.e., pre-encoding vs. pre-retrieval) on viewing and making art. Adults (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;303) viewed an art slideshow, completed an art-viewing testing task, and an art-making task (photography) after being exposed to a 5-min focused-attention mindfulness (vs. control) induction. Induction was presented either before or after the art slideshow (pre-encoding vs. pre-retrieval). Participants who were randomly assigned to the mindfulness (vs. control) condition created photographs that were more creative, complex, abstract, expressive, and higher in emotional valence. Furthermore, participants who experienced an induction (regardless of mindfulness or control) at the pre-encoding (vs. pre-retrieval) stage were better at differentiating between old and new artworks at a later memory test. Results show that mindfulness significantly enhances people's art, in this case their photographs. Findings also suggest that the mindfulness induction may not enhance participants' memory for art. Future studies will need to examine the effect of other types of mindfulness inductions (e.g., open-monitoring) on people's experience of viewing and making art.
