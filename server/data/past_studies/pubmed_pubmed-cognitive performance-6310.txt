Study Title: Hypohydration alters pre-frontal cortex haemodynamics, but does not impair motor learning.

Study Summary:
It is unknown how hypohydration influences fine motor performance training and motor learning. Here, 30 participants (aged 19-46&#xa0;years) were randomly assigned to a hypohydration (HYPO) or control (CON) group (both n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). Moderate hypohydration (~&#x2009;2.4% loss in body mass) was produced in HYPO via active dehydration before a 46&#xa0;min fluid restricted rest period was undertaken. The conclusion of rest coincided with when CON attended the facilities. Both groups undertook a discrete sequence production task consisting of 6 training blocks, and returned&#x2009;~&#x2009;300&#xa0;min later to complete a delayed retention and transfer test while euhydrated. Bilateral pre-frontal cortex (PFC) haemodynamics were assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy throughout training and delayed learning assessments. Response time improved across training (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) and was similar between the groups (both P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22). Analysis of training PFC haemodynamics revealed a significant group by block interaction for oxygenated (OHb; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), but not deoxygenated haemoglobin (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.77). In training block 1, bilateral OHb was higher in HYPO (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), while bilateral OHb increased in CON between blocks 2-3 and 5-6 (both P&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.03). During the delayed retention and transfer test, no group differences or interactions were found in response time, response error, or PFC haemodynamics (all P&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.27). Moderate hypohydration does increase PFC activation during motor skill learning, however, this appears to be transient and of little consequence to training or delayed retention or transfer performance.
