Study Title: Low-dose pegylated recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor as hematopoietic support for adjuvant chemotherapy in Chinese patients with breast cancer: An open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial.

Study Summary:
The recommended dosage of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) for Western chemotherapy patients is 6&#xa0;mg per cycle. However, for Eastern Asians, the optimal dose remains unknown. This open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial (NCT05283616) enrolled Chinese female breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants were randomized to receive either 3 or 6&#xa0;mg of PEG-rhG-CSF per cycle, stratified by body weight (BW; &#x2264;60&#x2009;kg vs. >60&#x2009;kg). The primary endpoint was timely absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery before the second cycle of chemotherapy. A total of 122 patients were randomized and 116 were included for efficacy analyses. The timely ANC recovery rate in the 3&#xa0;mg arm was 89.8%, compared to 93.0% in the 6&#xa0;mg arm (one-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] lower limit for difference: -11.7%), meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 15%. The rate was 93.3% with PEG-rhG-CSF 3&#xa0;mg and 96.6% with 6&#xa0;mg in patients with BW&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;60&#x2009;kg, and 86.2% and 89.3%, respectively, in those with BW&#x2009;>&#x2009;60&#x2009;kg. Although the incidence of severe neutropenia was similar across arms, the occurrence of excessively high ANC and white blood cell counts was higher in the 6&#xa0;mg arm. No grade &#x2265;3 adverse events related to PEG-rhG-CSF occurred. Three milligrams of PEG-rhG-CSF per cycle provided non-inferior neutrophil protection and attenuated neutrophil overshoot compared to 6&#xa0;mg doses. This low-dose regimen could be a new supportive care option for Chinese breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
