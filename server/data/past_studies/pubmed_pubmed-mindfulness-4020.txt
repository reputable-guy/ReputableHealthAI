Study Title: Participants' perspectives on a multimodal stress management and comprehensive lifestyle modification program for patients with Crohn's disease-A qualitative interview study.

Study Summary:
Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is prevalent worldwide and associated with reduced quality of life for patients. Multimodal therapy approaches, which emphasize lifestyle modifications such as mindfulness and stress reduction, can be promising in enhancing health-related quality of life for IBD patients. However, research on multimodal therapy approaches for CD remains insufficient. This qualitative interview study is part of a mixed-methods approach that is embedded in a randomized controlled trial. It investigates the impact of a comprehensive 10-week day clinic lifestyle modification program on the health condition and quality of life of CD patients. Telephone interviews (n = 19) were conducted three months after the program to examine individuals' viewpoints on the intervention, including perceived changes and transfer of elements into daily life. Reflexive thematic analysis was performed using MAXQDA software. The results indicate that CD can have very individual and comprehensive impacts (psychological, physical, social), leading to reduced perceived quality of life and well-being. By participating in the program, patients wanted to find self-help options to complement conventional pharmacotherapy and actively manage their disease. Patients expressed high satisfaction with the program, feeling it provided valuable support for daily disease management. They were able to integrate adequate therapy elements into their routines to complement their care. Patients recognized significant improvements in various domains, mainly in the psychological domain, e.g., improved self-efficacy, symptom management, and, also partly physical/symptomatic and social improvements. A multimodal stress reduction and lifestyle modification day clinic appears to be beneficial as a complementary therapy for CD patients. It offers additional options and helps patients to address individual symptoms and needs, improve their understanding of the disease and their quality of life. Although promising, further research is needed to assess its long-term effects. ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT05182645.
