Study Title: Effect ofSupplementation on Indices of Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage after Eccentric Protocol of Upper Limbs in Apparently Healthy Volunteers.

Study Summary:
Spirulina is a supplement with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may enhance performance and recovery after intense exercise. The present study aimed to investigate the effects ofon physical performance, and recovery markers after intense eccentric exercise in healthy moderately physically active volunteers. In a double-blind crossover design, participants were supplemented either with spirulina (42 mg KgBW per day) or a placebo for 15 days before conducting an eccentric exercise protocol using the non-dominant arm. A six-week washout period was required between conditions. Performance and mobility markers such as isometric peak torque (PTQ), ligament range of motion (ROM), and perceived muscle discomfort (VAS) were assessed and blood samples (CK, LDH) were obtained at 1, 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise. No significant differences were noticed between the two conditions on any of the investigated markers, indicating that spirulina supplementation has no positive effect on isometric muscle performance or alleviation of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) symptoms in the specific population.
