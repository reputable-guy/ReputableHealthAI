Study Title: Physician workload and practice management in pediatric gastroenterology.

Study Summary:
The pediatric gastroenterology workforce has grown in the last few decades. The North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) formed a task force to understand current pediatric gastroenterology organizations' practice&#xa0;structures. 19-item electronic survey was distributed to NASPGHAN members who were clinical or academic division directors. 30% responded to the survey, all directors of academic practices. The median number of clinical sessions per week was seven sessions, and the median individual work relative value unit&#xa0;(wRVU) target for practices was 4000-4500. Healthcare team ratios compared to provider clinical full-time equivalent&#xa0;were reported as the following: Nursing 0.80, medical assistant (MA) 0.29, dietitian 0.29, social worker 0.14, and psychologist 0.13. Regarding compensation, 68.0% were salaried with bonus based on billing or director decision, 28.0% were salaried with no incentive pay, and 4.0% were salaried with a portion at risk if the target was not met, and a bonus was given if the target was met. Most practices participated in a wellness activity with the most common strategies being didactic lectures about physician burnout (80%), annual burnout check-ins (68%), and/or after-hours social activities&#xa0;(60%). Pediatric gastroenterology practices vary regarding clinical sessions per week and annual wRVU targets with the median at seven&#xa0;sessions per week and an annual goal of 4000-4500 wRVUs, similar to reported national benchmark goals at the 50th percentile. Healthcare teams, including nursing, MAs, dietitians, social workers, and psychologists, had similar ratios of staff to providers for all sizes and types of practices. Most practices are engaging in wellness initiatives.
