Study Title: SBT2786 Improves Sleep Quality in Japanese Adults with Relatively High Levels of Stress: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Sleep disorders associated with lifestyle changes and unhealthy habits are major public health concerns. Our previous study showed thatSBT2786 has a potent sleep-promoting effect on fruit flies. Fruit flies share many similarities with mammals, making them suitable model organisms for studying sleep. Thus, in the present study, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test whether SBT2786 has sleep-enhancing effects in humans. In this study, 61 participants in the SBT2786 group and 65 participants in the placebo group were analyzed. The results showed that SBT2786 increased sleep time; however, it predominantly increased light sleep and did not improve subjective sleep quality. Interestingly, mood improvement was observed. A subgroup analysis was conducted on participants with high stress levels, and results showed that these participants experienced an increase in sleep duration and an improvement in sleepiness upon waking up and reported feeling well-rested during the day. We concluded that SBT2786 may improve sleep quality, particularly in individuals experiencing high levels of stress, and that SBT2786 can be used as a dietary supplement to improve sleep and mood.
