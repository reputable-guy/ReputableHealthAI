Study Title: Success4Life Youth Empowerment Pilot for Promoting Well-Being in University Students: A Qualitative Study.

Study Summary:
Background and aim The Success4Life (S4L) program is a web-based, holistic&#xa0;social-emotional learning (SEL) initiative aimed at improving the mental wellness of adolescents and young adults. It adopts a coaching student-led active learning methodology that integrates hands-on experiences with positive psychology along with inquiry-based learning (IBL) and project-based learning. The objective of this study was to examine and understand the experiences of the participants with the S4L program when conducted per the published protocol. Methods This primarily qualitative exploratory study adopted a mixed-methods study design based on a previously published protocol. This preliminary study examined the experiences of the first cohort of students in the pilot phase at a mid-Atlantic university in the United States. Results A total of 10 students were approached, and four expressed interest in participating and completed the informed consent form. Three out of four participants completed the full program. The thematic analysis from the focus group interview of the three participants who successfully completed the S4L program revealed several critical findings. The participants appreciated the program's effectiveness in enhancing self-reflection and self-awareness and reducing stress through improved social interactions, enhanced self-care, and positive thinking. Practical skills such as time management and mindful social media usage were considerably enhanced, contributing to better sleep patterns and increased personal productivity. However, feedback from the participants highlighted the need for incorporating more interactive and peer-based learning methods. Conclusions The study suggests integrating more real-time discussions and peer interactions to enhance the learning experience in synchronous virtual settings. Overall, the S4L program demonstrates substantial potential in fostering significant improvements in mental health and well-being among the youth, with recommendations for enhancing peer-based interactive elements in future iterations.
