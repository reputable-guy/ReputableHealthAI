Study Title: "Brain-IT": Exergame training with biofeedback breathing in neurocognitive disorders.

Study Summary:
The combination of exergame-based motor-cognitive training with resonance breathing guided by heart-rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) targets various relevant mechanisms of action to alleviate the pathological state in mild neurocognitive disorders (mNCD). This randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated the effectiveness of adding this novel intervention approach to usual care in mNCD. The individualized intervention was delivered via the "Brain-IT" training concept, which was iteratively co-designed, tested, and refined with patient and public involvement. We observed statistically significant effects with large effect sizes for global cognitive performance, immediate verbal recall, and delayed verbal recall in favor of the intervention group. Fifty-five percent of participants showed a clinically relevant improvement in response to training. Confirmatory RCTs are warranted to investigate whether the observed improvements in cognitive performance translate to affecting the rates of progression to or onset of dementia and test the implementation of the training in clinical practice. We proposed a novel intervention approach for mild neurocognitive disorders. It combines exergame-based training with biofeedback-guided resonance breathing. Our results confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Fifty-five percent of participants showed a clinically relevant improvement in response to training.
