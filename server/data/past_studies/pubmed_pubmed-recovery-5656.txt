Study Title: Dexmedetomidine-ketamine combination versus fentanyl-midazolam for patient sedation during flexible bronchoscopy: a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Sedation during flexible bronchoscopy (FB) should maintain an adequate respiratory drive, ensure maximum comfort for the patient, and warrant that the objectives of the procedure are achieved. Nevertheless, the optimal sedation method for FB has yet to be established. This study aimed to compare the standard recommended combination of midazolam-fentanyl (MF) with that of dexmedetomidine-ketamine (DK) for patient sedation during FB. Patients subjected to FB were randomly assigned to a DK (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) and an MF group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25). The primary outcome was the rate of critical desaturation events (arterial oxygen saturation&#x2009;<&#x2009;80% with nasal oxygen supply 2&#xa0;L/min). Secondary outcomes included sedation depth, hemodynamic complications, adverse events, and patient and bronchoscopist satisfaction. The incidence rates of critical desaturation events were similar between the two groups (DK: 12% vs. MF: 28%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.289). DK achieved deeper maximum sedation levels (higher Ramsay - lower Riker scale; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and was associated with longer recovery times (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Both groups had comparable rates of hemodynamic and other complications. Patient satisfaction was similar between the two groups, but bronchoscopist satisfaction was higher with the DK combination (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033). DK demonstrated a good safety profile in patients subjected to FB and achieved more profound sedation and better bronchoscopist satisfaction than the standard MF combination without increasing the rate of adverse events.
