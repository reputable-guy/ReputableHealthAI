Study Title: Effectiveness of a year-long individual cognitive stimulation program in Portuguese older adults with cognitive impairment.

Study Summary:
Cognitive stimulation is a recommended therapy with positive effects on the cognitive performance of older adults with neurocognitive disorders. However, there are few one-on-one, long-term interventions applied by professionals. The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of 47-week individual cognitive stimulation (iCS) interventions on cognition, mood, instrumental activities of daily living, and quality of life in older adults, with neurocognitive disorders using a single-blind, randomized, parallel two-arm RCT. A sample of 59 older adults with neurocognitive disorders (predominantly Alzheimer's disease), who were non-institutionalized but socially vulnerable, was selected. The intervention group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) received 47 iCS weekly sessions. The control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;29) maintained their baseline treatments. Outcomes were global cognitive function, cognitive impairment, mood, instrumental activities of daily living, and self-reported quality of life. All participants were assessed at baseline, 25&#xa0;weeks, and 50&#xa0;weeks. The results showed a significant effect of the intervention on MMSE, MoCA, GDS-15. Individual cognitive stimulation may have beneficial effects on the cognitive function and mood of older adults with cognitive impairment.
