Study Title: Influences of Parenting Education on Development of Obesity Among Young Children.

Study Summary:
This project aimed to prevent obesity in high-risk infants using community health workers.&#xdf;to provide mothers with culturally appropriate nutrition and health education. This randomized controlled trial enrolled mothers prenatally and infants at birth. Mothers were Spanish-speaking WIC participants with obesity. Trained, Spanish-fluent, community health workers visited homes of intervention mothers to encourage breastfeeding, and promote delayed introduction of solid foods, adequate sleep, limited screen time, and active play. A blinded research assistant collected data at the home. Outcomes were weight-for-length and BMI-z scores, obesity at age 3.&#xdf;years and percent time obese during follow-up. Data were analyzed using multiple variable regression. Of 177 children enrolled at birth, 108 were followed to age 30...36.&#xdf;months. At the final visit, 24% of children were obese. Obese status at age 3.&#xdf;did not differ between intervention and control (P.&#xdf;=.&#xdf;.32). Using BMI-z at the final visit, we observed a significant interaction between education and breastfeeding (P.&#xdf;=.&#xdf;.01). Time spent while obese from birth until age 30...36.&#xdf;months, by multiple variable analysis, did not show significant differences between intervention and control, but breastfed children experienced significantly less time obese than formula fed (P.&#xdf;=.&#xdf;.03). Formula-fed children in the control group, spent 29.8% of time obese, while breastfed infants in the intervention group spent 11.9% of time obese. The educational intervention did not prevent obesity at age 3.&#xdf;years. However, time spent obese from birth to age 3.&#xdf;years was best in breastfed children living in homes regularly visited by community health workers.
