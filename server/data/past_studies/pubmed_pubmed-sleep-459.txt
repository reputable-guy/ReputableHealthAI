Study Title: [Acupuncture combined with repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation for mild to moderate post-stroke depression: a randomized controlled trial].

Study Summary:
To explore the clinical effect of acupuncture combined with repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for mild to moderate post-stroke depression. Ninety patients with mild to moderate post-stroke depression were randomly divided into a combination group (30 cases, 4 cases dropped out), an acupuncture group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped out) and a rTMS group (30 cases, 5 cases dropped out). All the three groups received basic treatment, the combination group was treated with acupuncture combined with rTMS, the acupuncture group was treated with acupuncture, and the rTMS group was treated with rTMS. The acupuncture was applied at Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (GV 24) , Danzhong (CV 17) and bilateral Shenmen (HT 7), Taichong (LR 3), Neiguan (PC 6). All the three groups were treated once a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-17) score, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) score and event-related potential were compared among the three groups before and after treatment. After treatment, the HAMD-17 scores and PSQI scores in the three groups were reduced compared with those before treatment (<0.01) , and the HAMD-17 score and PSQI score in the combination group were lower than those in the acupuncture group and the rTMS group (<0.05). After treatment, the latency of event-related potential (P300, mismatch negativity&#xff3b;MMN&#xff3d;) in the three groups was shortened compared with that before treatment (<0.05), and the latency of event-related potential in the combination group was shorter than that in the acupuncture group and the rTMS group (<0.05). Acupuncture combined with rTMS can effectively alleviate the depressive state of patients with mild to moderate post-stroke depression, improve the sleep quality and the latency of event-related potential P300 and MMN.
