Study Title: Effect of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading on postoperative insulin resistance, patient-perceived well-being, and surgical outcomes in elective colorectal surgery: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the independent determinants influencing the length of hospital stay (LOHS) and postoperative complications in colorectal procedures. Preoperative oral carbohydrate loading (OCL) has emerged as a prospective countermeasure for IR. This study aimed to investigate the effects of preoperative carbohydrate loading on postoperative IR, inflammatory parameters, and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. This was an open-label, parallel arm, superiority randomized controlled trial conducted over 2 years. Participants were assigned to conventional fasting and oral OCL groups. IR, insulin sensitivity, Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), and interleukin 6 levels were analyzed on the day of surgery and on the first postoperative day (POD-1) and third POD (POD-3). Clinical parameters, such as thirst, hunger, dry mouth, anxiety, weakness, pain, nausea, and vomiting, were compared in the perioperative period. In addition, surgical clinical outcomes, such as intestinal recovery, time to independent ambulation, postoperative morbidity, and LOHS, were studied. A total of 72 participants were included, with 36 in each group. In the OCL group, there was a statistically significant decrease in postoperative IR on the day of surgery, POD-1, and POD-3 (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.0336). Similarly, inflammatory parameters and the GPS were found to be significantly lower in the OCL group (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001). Clinical parameters, such as thirst, hunger, and dry mouth, were significantly lower in the intervention group (P =.00), with a shortened LOHS. This study demonstrated that preoperative carbohydrate loading is associated with reduced IR and inflammatory markers, shortened hospital stays, and improved overall clinical outcomes in elective colorectal surgery.
