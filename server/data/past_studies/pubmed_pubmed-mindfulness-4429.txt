Study Title: The impact of a virtual mind-body program on resilience factors among international English-speaking adults with neurofibromatoses: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To test the effects of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program - Neurofibromatosis (3RP-NF), a mind-body resilience program for people with NF, on resilience factors from baseline to post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-up. This is a secondary analysis of a fully powered randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 3RP-NF and health education control (HEP-NF). We recruited adults with NF1, NF2, or schwannomatosis who reported stress or difficulty coping with NF symptoms. Both conditions received 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions; 3RP-NF focused on building resilience skills. We measured resilience factors via the Measure of Current Status-A (adaptive coping), Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (mindfulness), Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (gratitude), Life Orientation Test Optimism Scale (optimism), and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (perceived social support) at baseline, post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-up. We used linear mixed models with completely unstructured covariance across up to four repeated measurements (baseline, post-treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-up) to investigate treatment effects on resilience factors. We enrolled 228 individuals (M=42.7, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.6; 74.5% female; 87.7% White; 72.8% NF1, 14.0% NF2, 13.2% schwannomatosis). Within groups, both 3RP-NF and HEP-NF showed statistically significant improvements in all outcomes across timepoints. 3RP-NF showed significantly greater improvement in adaptive coping compared to HEP-NF from baseline to post-intervention and baseline to 6 months (M= 0.29; 95% CI 0.13-0.46; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; M= 0.25; 95% CI 0.07-0.33; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005); there were no other between-group differences amongst the remaining resilience factors. 3RP-NF showed promise in sustainably improving coping abilities amongst people with NF.
