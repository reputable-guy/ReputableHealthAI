Study Title: The impact of physical therapy intervention of dysphagia on preventing pneumonia in acute stroke patients: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Dysphagia is a common complication following stroke. It corresponds to the development of pneumonia, which is always associated with bad prognosis, longer hospital stays and increased mortality. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of physical therapy intervention of dysphagia on preventing pneumonia in acute stroke patients. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out on 70 ischemic stroke patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, age ranged from 49 to 65&#xa0;years. They were randomly assigned to two groups (control and study) of equal number. Patients in the control group received oral care and nasogastric tube feeding, while patients in the study group received the same program in addition to the designed physical therapy program (exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation). The intervention program was applied for 40&#xa0;min/session, 1 session/day, and 5&#xa0;days/week for 4&#xa0;weeks. Gugging swallowing screen (GUSS), and stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) control and prevention criteria were used to assess dysphagia and incidence of pneumonia at baseline, after two and 4&#xa0;weeks of intervention for both groups. Before treatment, all patients were susceptible to pneumonia after two and 4&#xa0;weeks of intervention; there were a significant increase in GUSS score in both groups with more improvement in favor of the study group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) and a statistically significant increase in incidence of SAP after 2&#xa0;weeks of intervention only in the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The results also showed a significant negative correlation between GUSS score and SAP (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;- 0.3662, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0018) IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY PRACTICE: adding physical therapy (exercise therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation) to oral care and nasogastric tube feeding is effective in improving oropharyngeal dysphagia and decreasing the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in acute ischemic stroke patients.
