Study Title: Effect of antihypertensive agents on sleep apnea and ambulatory blood pressure in patients with hypertension: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension are common conditions that may be linked through sympathetic activation and water retention. We hypothesized that diuretics, which reduce the body water content, may be more effective than amlodipine, a blood pressure (BP)-lowering agent implicated with edema, in controlling OSA in patients with hypertension. We also aimed to compare the effects of these treatments on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, we compared the effects of chlorthalidone/amiloride 25/5&#xa0;mg with amlodipine 10&#xa0;mg on OSA measured by portable sleep monitor and BP measured by ABPM. The study included participants older than 40 who had moderate OSA (10-40 apneas/hour of sleep) and BP within the systolic range of 140-159&#xa0;mmHg or diastolic range of 90-99&#xa0;mmHg. The individuals in the experimental groups were comparable in age, gender, and other relevant characteristics. Neither the combination of diuretics nor amlodipine alone reduced the AHI after 8 weeks of treatment (AHI 26.3 with diuretics and 25.0 with amlodipine. P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.713). Both treatments significantly lowered office, 24-h, and nighttime ABP, but the two groups had no significant difference. Chlorthalidone associated with amiloride and amlodipine are ineffective in decreasing the frequency of sleep apnea episodes in patients with moderate OSA and hypertension. Both treatments have comparable effects in lowering both office and ambulatory blood pressure. The notion that treatments could offer benefits for both OSA and hypertension remains to be demonstrated. TRIAL REGISTRATION CLINICALTRIALS. NCT01896661.
