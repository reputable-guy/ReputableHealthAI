Study Title: The effect of loving-kindness meditation on employees' mindfulness, affect, altruism and knowledge hiding.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the effects of the loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on employees' mindfulness, affect, altruism and knowledge hiding. In total, 100 employees were recruited from a knowledge-based enterprise in China and randomly divided into the LKM training group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50) and the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50). The LKM training group underwent LKM training for 8&#xa0;weeks, while the control group did not. Seven main variables (mindfulness, altruism positive affect, negative affect, playing dumb, rationalized hiding, and evasive hiding) were measured both before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention. The LKM intervention significantly increased participants' altruism, and significantly reduced negative affect, playing dumb and evasive hiding, but did not significantly improve mindfulness, positive affect, and rationalized hiding. LKM significantly improved employees' altruism, and significantly reduce their negative affect, but did not significantly improve their mindfulness and positive affect. For knowledge hiding, LKM significantly reduced playing dumb and evasive hiding, but had no significant effect on rationalized hiding. These results further elucidate the psychological effects of LKM and suggest the possibility of reducing knowledge hiding in the workplace. ChiCTR2200057460.
