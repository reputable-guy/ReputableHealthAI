Study Title: An investigation of the effect of mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy on demoralization, body image, and sexual function in Iranian women with breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Breast cancer is an extremely unpleasant and unbearable experience that can have a profound impact on a person's life. Compared to other types of cancer, breast cancer has a more severe psychological impact on women. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy on demoralization, body image, and sexual function in Iranian women with breast cancer. A sample of 30 women with breast cancer were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The research was conducted in the oncology division of Imam Reza Hospital in Kermanshah by the clinical trial method with a two-group pretest-posttest design and a 2&#xa0;month follow-up. Participants in the intervention group received Mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy for eight sessions. The intervention was carried out individually in weekly 60&#xa0;min sessions. While the control group received self-help treatment (through an educational book). A demographic questionnaire, Demoralization Scale (DS-II), Body Image Scale (BIS), and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) were used to collect data. For data analysis, means and standard deviations were calculated and repeated measures and the Bonferroni test was conducted using SPSS 26. The results showed the effectiveness of mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy on demoralization, body image, and sexual function (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Concerning demoralization in the intervention group, the pre-test mean was 16.73&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.33, and it reduced to 11.93&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.49 in the post-test. The body image mean score showed a decreasing trend in the intervention group, from 12.47&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.88 in the pre-test to 8.80&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.21 in the post-test. The mean score for sexual function showed an increasing trend, increasing from 18.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.29 in the pre-test to 23.07&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.91 in the post-test. There was no significant difference in the mean score of the post-test compared to the pre-test and follow-up in the control group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). MICBT can be used in conjunction with pharmaceuticals and medical treatments to improve the psychological symptoms of women with breast cancer, according to this study's results.
