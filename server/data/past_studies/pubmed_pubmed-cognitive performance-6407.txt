Study Title: Effect of a Social Networking Site Training on Cognitive Performance in Healthy Older People and Role of Personality Traits. Results from the Randomized Controlled Trial Ageing in a Networked Society-Social Experiment (ANS-SE) Study.

Study Summary:
The study aimed to evaluate the short-term efficacy of social network sites (SNSs) training on cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older individuals, and to explore the influence of personality traits on cognitive benefits of SNSs training. The Aging in a Networked Society-Social Experiment study was a randomized controlled trial with three arms: intervention group (course on SNSs use), active control group (lifestyle education) and waiting list. Among the 180 eligible participants, 144 participated, 115 completed the study. The assessment comprised: Stroop Color and Word Test, Wechsler tests (Digit span, Symbol search, Coding), and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire- Revised- Short Form. There was no significant cognitive improvement for treatment group versus the control groups. Time interference significantly worsened in lifestyle education group compared to the waiting list, after controlling for baseline test scores and personality traits. The present study does not support the usefulness of SNSs training with healthy older adults. The educational content of lifestyle education is not an inert condition among individuals with high levels of neuroticism and socially desirable responding. There is a need to design experimental conditions in the control groups which do not influence participant's outcomes.
