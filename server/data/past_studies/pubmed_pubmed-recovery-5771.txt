Study Title: Paresis of an upper extremity. Action observation and motor imagery in recovery of patients with chronic stroke.

Study Summary:
Action observation (AO) and motor imagery (MI) are considered functionally equivalent forms of motor representation related to movement execution (ME). Because of their characteristics, AO and MI have been proposed as techniques to facilitate the recovery of post-stroke hemiparesis in the upper extremities. An experimental, longitudinal, prospective, single-blinded design was undertaken. Eleven patients participated, and were randomly assigned to each study group. Both groups received 10 to 12 sessions of physical therapy. Five patients were assigned to the control treatment group, and six patients to the experimental treatment group (AO + MI). All were assessed before and after treatment for function, strength (newtons) and mobility (percentage) in the affected limb, as well as alpha desynchronisation (8-13 Hz) in the supplementary motor area, the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex while performing AO + MI tasks and action observation plus motor execution (AO + ME). The experimental group presented improvement in function and strength. A negative correlation was found between desynchronisation in the supplementary motor area and function, as well as a post-treatment increase in desynchronisation in the premotor cortex of the injured hemisphere in the experimental group only. An AO + MI-based intervention positively impacts recovery of the paretic upper extremity by stimulating the supplementary motor area, a cortex involved in movement preparation and learning. AO + MI therapy can be used as adjunctive treatment in patients with upper extremity paresis following chronic stroke.
