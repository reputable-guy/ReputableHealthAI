Study Title: Biophilic classroom environments on stress and cognitive performance: A randomized&#xa0;crossover&#xa0;study in virtual reality (VR).

Study Summary:
The emerging Metaverse will likely increase time expenditure in indoor virtual environments, which could impact human health and well-being. The biophilia hypothesis suggests that humans have an innate tendency to seek connections with the natural world and there is increasing evidence that biophilic design such as the incorporation of green plants can yield health benefits. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has been used to regulate stress and improve overall wellness, particularly by incorporating natural settings. In this randomized crossover study, we designed five virtual classroom scenes with different biophilic elements and turbidity in VR and investigated whether the visual stimulations can affect the stress levels and cognitive functions of 30 young adults from a university in China. We measured their physiological indicators of stress reaction by wearable biomonitoring sensors (blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and skin conductance level (SCL)), conducted verbal cognitive tests on attention and creativity, and evaluated subjective/perceived (self-reported) stress levels and connection with nature. Albeit our results suggested no significant change in physiological stress reactions or cognitive functions induced by the biophilic and turbid interventions in VR, the addition of biophilic elements in the Metaverse could benefit students' health due to significantly decreased perceived stress levels and increased connections with nature.
