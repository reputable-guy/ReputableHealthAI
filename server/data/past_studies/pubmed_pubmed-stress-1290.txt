Study Title: Supplementation with whey peptide rich in &#x3b2;-lactolin improves trait anxiety and subjective stress in healthy adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Study Summary:
Mental disorders have become one of the most burdensome health concerns. We have previously demonstrated that whey-derived &#x3b2;-lactolin (glycine-thereonine-tryptophan-tyrosine tetrapeptide) activates dopaminergic systems and improves psychiatric function in rodents. However, the effects of &#x3b2;-lactolin on human mood states have not been investigated. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with &#x3b2;-lactolin-rich whey peptide on human mood states. Sixty healthy adults (aged 45-64 years) with relatively low psychological health were randomly allocated to receive either whey peptide (containing &#x3b2;-lactolin 1.6&#xa0;mg/day) or placebo for 6 weeks. Mood states (primary outcomes) were evaluated using self-reporting questionnaires. Health-related quality of life (QOL), salivary stress marker and lipid mediator levels were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Compared with placebo, supplementation with &#x3b2;-lactolin improved changes in trait anxiety (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046), as assessed using the state-trait anxiety inventory, and in subjective stress (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043), as assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. In the assessment of QOL, changes in the vitality subscale and mental health summary score of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were improved in the &#x3b2;-lactolin group. The levels of salivary immunoglobulin A were significantly higher in the &#x3b2;-lactolin group. In a subgroup analysis by median age (54.5 years), subjective stress and salivary prostaglandin levels were significantly decreased by &#x3b2;-lactolin supplementation in the 45-54 -year-old subgroup. In conclusion, supplementation with &#x3b2;-lactolin improves trait anxiety, subjective stress, and psychological QOL, which may be associated with immunologic responses detected via salivary analysis.
