Study Title: Effects of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Stress Urinary Incontinence in North African Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) are involved in respiratory mechanisms. Additionally, stress urinary incontinence (SUI) can affect physical function. This randomized controlled trial was aimed at investigating the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on SUI severity, PFM function, and physical function in Tunisian women with SUI. Twenty-seven incontinent women were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. The following parameters were assessed: respiratory muscle strength (RMS; maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures), SUI severity (Urogenital Distress Inventory-6; Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7; pad test), PFM function (Modified Oxford Scale, electromyography, and endurance), and physical function (Timed Up & Go test; 6-min walk test; incremental shuttle walking test). IMT was conducted using threshold IMT. The IMT program significantly reduced the severity of SUI (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), improved PFM function (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), enhanced physical function (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), and increased RMS (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Inspiratory muscle training could be an effective method for improving pelvic floor disorders and physical function in women with SUI.
