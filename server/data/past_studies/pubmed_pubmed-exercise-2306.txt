Study Title: Walking training decreases cardiovascular load after walking to maximal intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease.

Study Summary:
This study investigated whether: 1) walking training (WT) changes cardiovascular load after walking until maximal intermittent claudication (IC) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD); and 2) acute and chronic cardiovascular responses to walking were related to each other. A randomized, controlled, parallel-group design was employed. Thirty-two men with PAD and IC were randomly assigned to one of two groups: WT (n=16) or control (CO, n=16) twice a week for 12 weeks. The WT group completed 15, 2-min bouts of walking at moderate intensity interspersed with 2-min upright resting intervals per session. The CO group completed 30 minutes of stretching per session. At Baseline and after 12 weeks, both groups underwent a progressive walking session to maximal IC (3.2 km/h, 2% increase in grade every 2 min). Systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, heart rate (HR), and rate pressure product (RPP) were measured pre- and post-walking. Data were analyzed by three-way mixed ANOVAs. Pearson correlations were used to explore the association between the acute and chronic responses. WT significantly reduced pre- and post-walking systolic BP (p<0.001), diastolic BP (p<0.001), and RPP (p<0.001). No significant correlations were found between the acute and chronic changes observed for all variables (all p>0.05). In patients with PAD, WT decreased cardiovascular load assessed before and after walking to maximal IC. Furthermore, the acute and chronic cardiovascular responses to walking were not associated. Thus, WT may reduce the risk of immediate post-walking cardiac events in susceptible patients.
