Study Title: Comparison of the effects of pelvic floor muscle training and modified pilates exercises in elderly women with stress urinary incontinence: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and modified pilates exercises (MPE) in elderly women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Both randomized groups [Group 1: PFMT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17), Group 2: MPE (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17)] performed their exercises twice a week for 12&#xa0;weeks. Incontinence Severity Index (ISI), Urogenital Distress Inventory-Short Form (UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Short Form (IIQ-7) were used to assess SUI frequency and level of exposure from symptoms, electromyography (EMG) device was used to assess PFM activation response and a stabilizer was used to assess transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle strength. The assessments were performed at baseline and at week 12. While in-group assessment there were statistically significant differences in ISI, UDI-6, IIQ-7 in both groups at week 12 (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05); in the assessment between groups, there were statistically significant difference for EMG-work avarage (U&#xa0;=&#xa0;60.00, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02), EMG-work peak (U&#xa0;=&#xa0;62,50, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03) and EMG-rest peak (U&#xa0;=&#xa0;61,50, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03) in favor of Group 1 and TrA muscle strength (U&#xa0;=&#xa0;61.00, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) in favor of Group 2 from baseline to week 12 (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). In summary, MPE can be considered alternative and safe exercise in clinic for elderly women with SUI who do not want to receive PFMT for various reasons.
