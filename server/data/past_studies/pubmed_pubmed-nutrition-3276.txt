Study Title: Inflammatory markers as diagnostic and precision nutrition tools for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: Results from the Fatty Liver in Obesity trial.

Study Summary:
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing public health concern. The disease is silent, and its diagnosis is often delayed. Inflammatory markers constitute an interesting tool to act as subrogate, non-invasive markers. This study aimed to evaluate the changes of inflammatory markers throughout a two-year dietary intervention in subjects presenting MASLD, to determine which of the markers are suitable to predict the disease, and act as a customizing tool for MASLD's dietary treatment. Ninety-eight subjects with MASLD and forty-five controls from the Fatty Liver in Obesity (FLiO) Study were analyzed. MASLD was diagnosed and graded by ultrasound. The MASLD subjects were randomly assigned to two different dietary strategies, the American Heart Association (AHA diet) or a dietary strategy based on the Mediterranean pattern, which was specially designed for the study (FLiO diet), and then followed for two years. Hepatic status was additionally assessed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), elastography, and determination of transaminases. Inflammatory markers improved throughout the intervention in the MASLD subjects and managed to reach similar levels to controls, especially at 6 and 12 months. Additionally, leptin, adiponectin, M30, and LECT2 managed to significantly diagnose the disease at all time marks of the intervention, making them candidates for subrogate non-invasive markers of the disease. Moreover, baseline chemerin, leptin, LECT2, and M65 were used to build a predictive score to achieve greater weight loss, and therefore, which strategy could be more useful for MASLD 's treatment. The predictive score was significantly able assign a specific diet to 55% of the study participants, meaning that the remaining 45% could achieve the same amount of weight loss following either diet equally. Inflammatory markers constitute a potential non-invasive tool to be used in MASLD screening and could also constitute an interesting tool for MASLD's treatment customization, being able to predict the effectiveness of a dietary strategy based on the initial inflammatory state of each subject. www. gov (NCT03183193).
