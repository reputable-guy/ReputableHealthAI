Study Title: Oyster hydrolysate ameliorates UVB-induced skin dehydration and barrier dysfunction.

Study Summary:
Ultraviolet (UV) exposure triggers skin aging primarily by disrupting skin barrier function, resulting in dry skin and wrinkle formation. Oyster hydrolysate (OH), as a functional food, has been reported for anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. This study investigated the underlying mechanism of OH effect on UVB-induced skin aging in SKH1 hairless mice. Mice were exposed to UVB three times per week while they were fed with a normal diet or diet containing OH for 10&#xa0;weeks. Additionally, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed to investigate the OH effect on human skin moisturizing to evaluate its efficacy and safety. UVB exposure increased parameters of skin aging; dehydration, transepidermal water loss, and macroscopic dorsal skin lesions. OH significantly reduced these features of skin aging. Histological analysis demonstrated that OH decreased skin epidermal and dermal thickness and collagen degradation induced by UVB. OH significantly reduced ROS production, suppressed macrophage activation and neutrophil infiltration, and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. OH improved skin barrier function by increasing the expression of filaggrin, aquaporin-3, and hyaluronic acid synthesis enzymes and promoting recovery from skin damage. Importantly, the results from a human clinical trial demonstrated that OH improved skin moisturization and integrity with no side effects. Taken together, OH supplementation ameliorates skin damage via anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and enhances skin hydration and barrier function. OH has a therapeutic potential for skin photoaging.
