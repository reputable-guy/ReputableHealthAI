Study Title: Administration of Free Amino Acids Improves Exogenous Amino Acid Availability when Compared with Intact Protein in Critically Ill Patients: A Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Protein digestion and amino acid absorption appear compromised in critical illness. The provision of enteral feeds with free amino acids rather than intact protein may improve postprandial amino acid availability. Our objective was to quantify the uptake of diet-derived phenylalanine after the enteral administration of intact protein compared with an equivalent amount of free amino acids in critically ill patients. Sixteen patients who were mechanically ventilated in intensive care unit (ICU) at risk of malabsorption received a primed continuous infusion of L-[ring-H]-phenylalanine and L-[ring-3,5-H]-tyrosine after an overnight fast. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 20 g intrinsically L-[1-C]-phenylalanine-labeled milk protein or an equivalent amount of amino acids labeled with free L-[1-C]-phenylalanine via a nasogastric tube over a 2-h period. Protein digestion and amino acid absorption kinetics and whole-body protein net balance were assessed throughout a 6-h period. After enteral nutrient infusion, both plasma phenylalanine and leucine concentrations increased (P-time < 0.001), with a more rapid and greater rise after free amino acid compared with intact protein administration (P-time &#xd7; treatment = 0.003). Diet-derived phenylalanine released into the circulation was 25% greater after free amino acids compared with intact protein administration [68.7% (confidence interval {CI}: 62.3, 75.1%) compared with 43.8% (CI: 32.4, 55.2%), respectively; P < 0.001]. Whole-body protein net balance became positive after nutrient administration (P-time < 0.001) and tended to be more positive after free amino acid in provision (P-time &#xd7; treatment = 0.07). The administration of free amino acids as opposed to intact protein further increases postprandial plasma amino acid availability in critically ill patients, allowing more diet-derived phenylalanine to become available to peripheral tissues. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04791774.
