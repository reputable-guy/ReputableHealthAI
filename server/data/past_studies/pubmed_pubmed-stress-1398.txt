Study Title: Effects of behavioral interventions on stress reactivity in adults with substance use disorders.

Study Summary:
Heightened reactivity to stress is associated with poor treatment outcome in people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Behavioral strategies can reduce stress reactivity; however, these strategies are understudied in people with SUDs. The objective of this study was to test the effect of two behavioral strategies (cognitive reappraisal and affect labeling) on stress reactivity in people with SUDs. Treatment-seeking adults with SUDs (= 119) were randomized to receive brief training in cognitive reappraisal, affect labeling, or a psychoeducational control, followed by a standardized stress induction. Markers of stress reactivity were collected before and following stress induction and included self-reported negative affect and substance craving, as well as salivary cortisol, and skin conductance response. Analyses of covariance did not indicate a significant effect of treatment condition on negative affect, cortisol, or skin conductance response. Participants in the affect labeling condition had greater increase in craving than those in the cognitive reappraisal condition; neither condition differed from control. Results indicated that, although participants were able to implement behavioral skills following a brief training, training condition did not modify stress reactivity, on average, relative to control. Future directions include consideration of individual differences in response to training and determination of whether higher "dosing" of skills via multiple sessions or extended practice is needed to influence stress reactivity in people with SUDs.
