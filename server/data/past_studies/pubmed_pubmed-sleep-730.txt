Study Title: The effects of web-based animation-supported progressive relaxation exercises applied to individuals with epilepsy on fatigue and sleep quality: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
The study was conducted to determine the effects of Progressive Relaxation Exercise, supported by mobile-based animation, on fatigue and sleep quality of individuals with epilepsy. The study was conducted in a randomized controlled design with a pretest-posttest model on epileptic individuals who applied to Giresun University, Faculty of Medicine, Neurology Outpatient Clinic between February and December 2022. By using power analysis, the sample of the study was determined as 60 epilepsy patients (30 in the Control Group, 30 in the Experimental Group). The data were collected by face-to-face interview technique with the Personal Information Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Frequencies, percentages, arithmetic mean, standard deviations, Pearson Correlation Analysis, Paired t-Test, Student's t-Test, and Chi-Square Test were used in the evaluation of the study data. When the Control Group's mean scores in the pre-test and post-tests, which were performed with an interval of 6 weeks, were compared, a statistically significant difference was detected between the FSS and PSQI scores (p>0.05). The mean Fatigue Severity Scale score was found to be 5.24 &#xb1; 0.69 before the Progressive Relaxation Exercises and 3.82 &#xb1; 0.77 after the exercises. The mean scores of the individuals on the Fatigue Severity Scale after the relaxation exercises were found to be lower at a statistically significant level than the mean scores before the relaxation exercises (p<0.001). The differences between subjective sleep quality (p<0.001), sleep latency (p<0.001), daytime dysfunction (p<0.001), and total sleep quality (p<0.001) score averages after the Progressive Relaxation Exercises were statistically significant compared to the pre-exercises status. When the post-test scores of the participants in the Experimental Group was examined, significant, moderate, and positive differences were detected between the FSS and Total PSQI scores (r: 0.373-p: 0.042), Subjective Sleep Quality (r: 0.487-p: 0.006), which is one of the sub-dimensions of PSQI, Sleeping Pill Use (r: 0.531-p: 0.003), and Daytime Dysfunction (r: 0.461-p: 0.01) scores. It was determined that individuals with epilepsy experience fatigue and deterioration in sleep quality and there is a reciprocal relationship between the severity of fatigue and sleep quality in these individuals. Progressive Relaxation Exercises applied with the animation-supported web-based mobile intervention technique reduce the fatigue levels of individuals and increase sleep quality.
