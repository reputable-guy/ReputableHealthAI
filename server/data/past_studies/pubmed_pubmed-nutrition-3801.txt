Study Title: The impact of avocado intake on anthropometric measures among Hispanic/Latino children and adolescents: A cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
While the association between avocado consumption and low metabolic risk has been shown in some studies conducted in adults, little is known about the potential effects of avocado consumption on health outcomes in children and adolescents. Thus, we investigated the impact of two levels of avocado allotment, plus a standard nutrition education, on measures of adiposity in children and adolescents (<18 years old). Children (aged 5-12, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;58) and adolescents (aged 13-17, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32) in seventy-two families that self-identified as Hispanic, with at least 3 members over the age of 5 that resided in the same home, were free of severe chronic disease, and not on specific diets, were randomized to one of two levels of avocado allotment plus bi-weekly nutrition education sessions. Low allotment families received 3 avocados per week, while high allotment families received 14 avocados per week for 6 months. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, using unpaired, 2-sided t-tests to test the mean changes in anthropometric measures of adiposity (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, and weight) between children and adolescents from high and low allotment families after the 6-month intervention. At six months, there were no significant differences in body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, or waist circumference to weight ratio by avocado allotment group. In children, there was a significant difference in weight (difference in means: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.09, 2.10, p-value&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03) and waist circumference to height ratio (difference in means: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.41, p-value <0.01) between the avocado allotment groups at six months, but these did not remain significant after sensitivity analyses including per-protocol analyses. In adolescents only, there was a significant reduction in waist to hip circumference ratio in the high allotment group compared to the low allotment group after 6 months (difference in means:&#xa0;-0.05, 95% CI:&#xa0;-0.08, 0.00, p-value&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) that persisted after multiple sensitivity analyses. Different levels of avocado availability among children and adolescents does not appear to result in significant changes in anthropometric measures. Further study is needed to determine whether avocado consumption promotes metabolic health in this age group.
