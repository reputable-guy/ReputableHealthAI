Study Title: Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Oral BI 1358894 in Healthy Japanese Male Volunteers.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND&#xa0;AND OBJECTIVES: BI 1358894, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of transient receptor potential canonical ion channels, is under development for treatment of major depressive disorder. Phase I trials assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics of BI 1358894 in Caucasian male healthy volunteers (HVs) have been performed. This Phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BI&#xa0;1358894 in Japanese male HVs. Male HVs were randomized to receive oral BI 1358894 (n = 18) or placebo (n = 6) after a high-fat, high-calorie meal within three dose groups (50&#xa0;mg, 100&#xa0;mg, 200&#xa0;mg), administered sequentially in dose-ascending order. The primary endpoint was number of HVs with drug-related adverse events (DRAEs). Secondary endpoints were the pharmacokinetic parameters of BI 1358894. Overall, 24 male HVs entered the trial [mean (standard deviation) age: 30.0 (7.6) years]. DRAEs occurred in 3/18 HVs (BI 1358894 100 mg group: one HV experienced dizziness and headache; BI 1358894 200 mg group: one HV experienced headache, another reported sleep disorder). BI 1358894 exposure increased dose dependently and proportionally, peaking 4-6&#xa0;h after administration before declining in a multiphasic manner with a terminal elimination half-life of ~70&#xa0;h in the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups, and 203 h in the 200 mg dose group. BI 1358894 was well tolerated with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in Japanese male HVs, similar to findings from a previous study in Caucasian male HVs.
