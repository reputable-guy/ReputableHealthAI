Study Title: Regular Exercise Improved Fatigue and Musculoskeletal Pain in Young Adult Psoriatic Patients without Psoriatic Arthritis.

Study Summary:
Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are also frequent in patients with psoriasis (PsO) without arthritis (PsA). The current study aimed to assess the impact of an intervention program based on aerobic training to reduce fatigue and musculoskeletal pain in patients with PsO without PsA. A total of 118 male patients with PsO volunteered in the current interventional study and were randomly allocated to the experimental (= 59) or control group (= 59). The intervention consisted of a 16-week aerobic training program on a treadmill, three sessions per week, consisting of a warm-up, 35-50 min treadmill exercise (increasing 5 min/4 weeks) at a work intensity of 50-65% of peak heart-rate (increasing 5%/4 weeks), and cooling-down. The functional assessment of chronic illness therapy fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue), health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI), and visual analog scale (VAS) were compared pre and post intervention. Nutritional intake, maximal aerobic power, lipid profile, serum markers of muscle damage, and body composition were also assessed. When compared to baseline, FACIT-Fatigue, HAQ-DI, and VAS scores were significantly improved without increasing markers of muscle damage. Fat mass percentage, lipid profile, and maximal oxygen consumption were also improved. In conclusion, a 16-week aerobic training program at moderate intensity was safe, well tolerated, and effective in psoriatic patients without PsA. Long-term follow-up studies are required to examine whether these promising results may improve clinical outcomes.
