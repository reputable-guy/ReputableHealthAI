Study Title: Effect of high-dose &#x3b2;-Alanine supplementation on uphill cycling performance in World Tour cyclists: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Scientists and coaches seek effective ergogenic aids for performance improvement. Cyclists commonly use &#x3b2;-Alanine, which may enhance post-exercise recovery and physical performance. High-dose &#x3b2;-Alanine supplementation's impact on World Tour cyclists during a 7-day camp remains unstudied. This study aimed to analyse the effect of a high dose of &#x3b2;-alanine in World Tour cyclist during a 7-day camp. A double-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted. 11 cyclists were included in the final analysis: &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation (n = 5; VO2max: 67.6&#xb1;1.6 ml/kg/min) and a placebo group (n = 6; VO2max: 68.0&#xb1;2.4 ml/kg/min). The duration of the supplementation protocol was seven days with four daily intakes. The subjects commenced supplementation after the physical tests (immediately following the snack) and consumed the final intake after breakfast on the day of the final test (a total of 7 days and 3 additional doses, 31 servings in total; 5g per dosage; 155g the total cumulative amount). Before and after seven days of supplementation, the cyclists performed an uphill time trial. Blood lactate, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion were measured during test. &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation improved the relative mean power attained during the time-trial compared with the control group (Z = -2.008; p = 0.045; &#x394; = 0.060), as well as the time needed to complete this trial (Z = -2.373; p = 0.018). As for physiological and metabolic variables, no significant change was found. In conclusion, the present study supports the effectiveness of one-week high dose of &#x3b2;-alanine during a cycling training in World Tour cyclists to improve their uphill time-trial performance. In addition, it is important to highlight the potential role of &#x3b2;-alanine in improving recovery power. This aspect is particularly relevant in the context of a training camp, where fatigue levels can increase alongside training intensity.
