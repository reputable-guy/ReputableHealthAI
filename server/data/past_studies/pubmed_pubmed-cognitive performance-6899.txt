Study Title: Simultaneous Aerobic Exercise and Memory Training Program in Older Adults with Subjective Memory Impairments.

Study Summary:
Several modifiable lifestyle factors have been shown to have potential beneficial effects in slowing cognitive decline. Two such factors that may affect cognitive performance and slow the progression of memory loss into dementia in older adults are cognitive training and physical activity. There are currently no effective treatments for dementia; therefore, preventative strategies to delay or prevent the onset of dementia are of critical importance. The aim of this study was to determine the relative effectiveness of simultaneous performance of memory training and aerobic exercise to a sequential performance intervention on memory functioning in older adults. 55 older adults (aged 60- 75) with subjective memory impairments (non-demented and non-MCI) completed the intervention that consisted of 90-minute small group classes held twice weekly. Participants were randomized to either 4-weeks of supervised strategy-based memory training done simultaneously while stationary cycling (SIM) or sequentially after the stationary cycling (SEQ). Standardized neurocognitive measures of memory, executive functioning, speed of processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The SIM group, but not the SEQ group, had a significant improvement on composite memory following the intervention (t(51)&#x200a;=&#x200a;2.7, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.01, effect size (ES)&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.42) and transfer to non-trained reasoning abilities (t(51)&#x200a;=&#x200a;6.0, ES&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.49) and complex attention (t(51)&#x200a;=&#x200a;3.1, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.003, ES&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.70). Conversely, the SEQ group, but not the SIM, showed significant improvement in executive functioning (t(51)&#x200a;=&#x200a;5.0, p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.0001, ES&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.96). These findings indicate that a 4-week simultaneous memory training and aerobic exercise program is sufficient to improve memory, attention, and reasoning abilities in older adults.
