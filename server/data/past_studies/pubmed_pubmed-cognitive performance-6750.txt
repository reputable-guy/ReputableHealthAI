Study Title: The effects of TeaCrine&#xae; and caffeine on endurance and cognitive performance during a simulated match in high-level soccer players.

Study Summary:
Theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric-acid) is a pure alkaloid with a similar structure to caffeine and acts comparably as an adenosine receptor antagonist. Early studies have shown non-habituating effects, including increases in energy and focus in response to Teacrine&#xae;, the compound containing pure theacrine. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the effects of Teacrine&#xae; and caffeine on cognitive performance and time-to-exhaustion during a simulated soccer game in high-level male and female athletes. Male and female soccer players (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;24; M&#x2009;=&#x2009;20.96&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.05y, M&#x2009;=&#x2009;55.31&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.39&#x2009;mL/O/kg, M&#x2009;=&#x2009;50.97&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.90&#x2009;mL/O/kg) completed a 90-min simulated treadmill soccer match over four randomized sessions (TeaCrine&#xae;, caffeine, TeaCrine&#xae;&#x2009;+&#x2009;caffeine, placebo). Cognitive testing at halftime and end-of-game including simple reaction time (SRT), choice RT (CRT), and cognitive-load RT with distraction questions (COGRT/COGRT) was performed, with a run time-to-exhaustion (TTE) at 85% VOfollowing end-of-game cognitive testing. Session times and pre-exercise nutrition were controlled. RM-MANOVAs with univariate follow-ups were conducted and significance was set at P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05. TTE trended towards significance in TeaCrine&#xae; and TeaCrine&#xae;&#x2009;+&#x2009;caffeine conditions compared to placebo (P&#xa0;<&#x2009;0.052). A condition main effect (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) occurred with faster CRT in caffeine and TeaCrine&#xae;&#x2009;+&#x2009;caffeine compared to placebo. COGRTshowed a significant time main effect, with better accuracy at end-of-game compared to halftime (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). A time x condition interaction in SRT (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) showed placebo improved from halftime to end-of-game. The 27-38% improvements in TTE reflect increased performance capacity that may have important implications for overtime scenarios. These findings suggest TeaCrine&#xae; favorably impacts endurance and the combination with caffeine provides greater benefits on cognitive function than either supplement independently.
