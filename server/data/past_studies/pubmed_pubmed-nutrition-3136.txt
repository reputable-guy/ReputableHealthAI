Study Title: Delaying post-exercise carbohydrate intake impairs next-day exercise capacity but not muscle glycogen or molecular responses.

Study Summary:
To investigate how delayed post-exercise carbohydrate intake affects muscle glycogen, metabolic- and mitochondrial-related molecular responses, and subsequent high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) capacity. In a double-blind cross-over design, nine recreationally active men performed HIIE (10&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;2-min cycling, ~94% W&#x2d9;) in the fed state, on two occasions. During 0-3&#x2009;h post-HIIE, participants drank either carbohydrates ("Immediate Carbohydrate" [IC], providing 2.4&#x2009;g/kg) or water ("Delayed Carbohydrate" [DC]); total carbohydrate intake over 24 h post-HIIE was matched (~7&#x2009;g/kg/d). Skeletal muscle (sampled pre-HIIE, post-HIIE, +3 h, +8 h, +24&#x2009;h) was analyzed for whole-muscle glycogen and mRNA content, plus signaling proteins in cytoplasmic- and nuclear-enriched fractions. After 24&#x2009;h, participants repeated the HIIE protocol until failure, to test subsequent HIIE capacity; blood lactate, heart rate, and ratings of perceived effort (RPE) were measured throughout. Muscle glycogen concentrations, and relative changes, were similar between conditions throughout (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Muscle glycogen was reduced from baseline (mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD mmol/kg&#x2009;dm; IC: 409&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;166; DC: 352&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;76) at post-HIIE (IC: 253&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;96; DC: 214&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;82), +3&#x2009;h (IC: 276&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;62; DC: 269&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;116) and +&#x2009;8&#x2009;h (IC: 321&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;56; DC: 269&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;116), returning to near-baseline by +24&#x2009;h. Several genes (PGC-1&#x251;, p53) and proteins (p-ACC, p-P38 MAPK) elicited typical exercise-induced changes irrespective of condition. Delaying carbohydrate intake reduced next-day HIIE capacity (5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3 intervals) and increased RPE (~2 ratings), despite similar physiological responses between conditions. Molecular responses to HIIE (performed in the fed state) were not enhanced by delayed post-exercise carbohydrate intake. Our findings support immediate post-exercise refueling if the goal is to maximize next-day HIIE capacity and recovery time is &#x2264;24&#x2009;h.
