Study Title: The effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in middle-aged and older individuals with type 2 diabetes: A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The purposes of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to establish feasibility of participant recruitment and engagement in the exercise intervention. A total of 50 participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited from the study and randomly assigned to an aerobic exercise group or an attention control group. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of the exercise program, achieving a recruitment rate of 2.94 persons per month, a 76% retention rate, and an 80.56% attendance rate. The adherence rates were 79.54% and 76.48% for the aerobic exercise and attention control groups, respectively. However, we were not able to detect any statistically significant difference between the two groups. This pilot study established the feasibility of recruiting and engaging middle-aged older adults with type 2 diabetes in aerobic exercise. Based on these findings, a large-scale study assessing the effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive function in this population is needed.
