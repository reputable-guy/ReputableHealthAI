Study Title: Personalized nutrition in type 2 diabetes remission: application of digital twin technology for predictive glycemic control.

Study Summary:
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex condition marked by insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Traditional dietary interventions, such as low-calorie or low-carbohydrate diets, typically overlook individual variability in postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs), which can lead to suboptimal management of the disease. Recent advancements suggest that personalized nutrition, tailored to individual metabolic profiles, may enhance the effectiveness of T2D management. This study aims to present the development and application of a Digital Twin (DT) technology-a machine learning (ML)-powered platform designed to predict and modulate PPGRs in T2D patients. By integrating continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), dietary data, and other physiological inputs, the DT provides individualized dietary recommendations to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce hyperinsulinemia, and support the remission of T2D. We developed a sophisticated DT platform that synthesizes real-time data from CGM, dietary logs, and other biometric inputs to create personalized metabolic models for T2D patients. The intervention is delivered via a mobile application, which dynamically adjusts dietary recommendations based on predicted PPGRs. This methodology is validated through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing its impact on various metabolic markers, including HbA1c, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), blood pressure, body weight, ASCVD risk, albuminuria, and diabetic retinopathy. Preliminary data from the ongoing RCT and real-world study demonstrate the DT's capacity to generate significant improvements in glycemic control and metabolic health. The DT-driven personalized nutrition plan has been associated with reductions in HbA1c, enhanced beta-cell function, and normalization of hyperinsulinemia, supporting sustained T2D remission. Additionally, the DT's predictions have contributed to improvements in MAFLD markers, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk factors, highlighting its potential as a comprehensive management tool. The DT technology represents a novel and scalable approach to personalized nutrition in T2D management. By addressing individual variability in PPGRs, this method offers a promising alternative to conventional dietary interventions, with the potential to improve long-term outcomes and reduce the global burden of T2D.
