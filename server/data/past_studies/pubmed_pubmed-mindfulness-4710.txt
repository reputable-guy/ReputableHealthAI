Study Title: The comparison of brief, online mindfulness and relaxation interventions to reduce stress and improve sleep-related outcomes in college students.

Study Summary:
The current study aimed to examine whether brief online stress reduction exercises supplemented with sleep improvement strategies would reduce stress, arousal, and sleep difficulties in college students who were not required to use the sleep improvement strategies for participation. A sample of 114 college student participants were enrolled because they were experiencing stress and/or wanted to improve their sleep. Participants were randomized into an abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation, a mindful breathing, or a self-monitoring control condition for the 4-week intervention. Measures of physical relaxation, mindfulness, perceived stress, pre-sleep arousal, and insomnia symptom severity were collected. The APMR group improved on five of the six dependent measures and was significantly different than the SM group at posttest, but not different than the MB group. The results suggests promise for brief, online, scaled back stress reduction interventions to reduce stress, arousal, and sleep difficulties in college students.
