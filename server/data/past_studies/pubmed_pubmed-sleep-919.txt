Study Title: Effect of whole course seamless nursing mode on patients with chronic infectious wounds.

Study Summary:
Chronic infectious wounds seriously affect patients' quality of life. To assess the effect of whole course seamless nursing mode on patients with chronic infectious wounds. One hundred patients treated between January 2019 and December 2020 were randomly divided into control and observation groups (n=50) that were given routine nursing and whole course seamless nursing, respectively. Their pain score, comfort score, wound healing time, wound healing effect, psychological state scores, sleep indices, quality-of-life scores and degree of satisfaction with nursing were compared. Observation group had lower pain score and higher comfort score than those of control group after nursing (P<0.05). Compared with control group, observation group had shorter wound healing time and higher grade-A wound healing rate (P<0.05). The SDS and SAS scores of observation group were lower than those of control group (P<0.05). Observation group also had significantly shorter sleep latency, longer actual sleep time, lower PSQI score, as well as higher quality-of-life score and overall satisfaction rate than those of control group (P<0.05). For patients with chronic infectious wounds, whole course seamless nursing effectively relieves wound pain, facilitates wound healing, improves comfort, psychological state and sleep status, and makes them more satisfied.
