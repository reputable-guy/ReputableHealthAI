Study Title: INTERACT: a randomized phase 2 study of the DAAO inhibitor luvadaxistat in adults with schizophrenia.

Study Summary:
Deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Luvadaxistat (TAK-831/NBI-1065844) is an investigational d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor that increases d-serine levels at NMDAR coagonist sites. INTERACT is a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of three doses of luvadaxistat, covering a range of DAAO occupancy and d-serine levels, in patients with schizophrenia with persistent negative symptoms. The study included a 14-day, single-blinded placebo run-in period and a 12-week, double-blinded treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-week change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Negative Symptom Factor Score (PANSS NSFS). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the 12-week changes from baseline in Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) score and Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) score. Safety endpoints included adverse event assessments. The full analysis set included all randomized patients (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;256 [placebo, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;87; luvadaxistat 50&#xa0;mg, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;58; 125&#xa0;mg, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;56; 500&#xa0;mg, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;55]); 228 patients completed the study. No significant improvements in PANSS NSFS were observed at any dose versus placebo at week 12. Improvements were observed with luvadaxistat 50&#xa0;mg versus placebo in cognitive endpoints: BACS composite score (nominal one-sided p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.031) and SCoRS interviewer total score (nominal one-sided p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011). Luvadaxistat did not significantly improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, luvadaxistat 50&#xa0;mg met the prespecified secondary endpoints for cognitive performance (BACS) and function (SCoRS), warranting further investigation in patients with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Luvadaxistat was well-tolerated in INTERACT, with no new safety signals observed. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03382639.
