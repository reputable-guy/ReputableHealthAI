Study Title: Effectiveness of auricular acupuncture and pelvic floor muscle training in the management of urinary incontinence following surgical treatment for prostate cancer: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture combined with pelvic floor muscle training to manage urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy. This is a randomized clinical trial that was conducted between April 2019 and April 2020 with 60 participants allocated into two groups, namely: control (pelvic muscle training) and intervention (auricular acupuncture&#xa0;+&#xa0;pelvic muscle training). Interventions were carried out during eight weekly sessions. Generalized estimating equations and proportion difference tests were applied in the statistical analysis with a significance level of 0.05. Urinary incontinence severity decreased between pre-test and post-test in both groups. There was a statistically significant difference of the impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life between the groups at post-test in the domain "severity measures" (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013), and only in the intervention group between pre-test and post-test in the domains "emotions" (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and "sleep and mood" (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008). The intervention group was 20.8% (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007) and 25.3% (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002) less likely to present nocturia and urinary urgency, respectively. Auricular acupuncture combined with pelvic floor muscle training was more effective, compared to pelvic floor muscle training alone, in reducing the impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life and reducing the odds of nocturia and urinary urgency.
