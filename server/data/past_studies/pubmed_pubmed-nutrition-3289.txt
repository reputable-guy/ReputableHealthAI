Study Title: Effects of walnut consumption for 2&#x2009;years on older adults' bone health in the Walnuts and Healthy Aging (WAHA) trial.

Study Summary:
Nutritional strategies to maintain bone health in aging individuals are of great interest. Given the beneficial nutrient composition of walnuts, rich in alpha-linolenic (the vegetable n-3 fatty acid) and polyphenols, their regular consumption might be a dietary option to reduce age-related bone loss. We determined whether daily walnut consumption improves bone mineral density (BMD) and circulating biomarkers of bone turnover. The Walnuts and Healthy Aging study (WAHA) is a two-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of a diet enriched with walnuts at &#x2248;15% energy compared with a control diet for 2&#x2009;years on age-related health outcomes in healthy men and women aged 63-79&#x2009;years. Changes in BMD were a prespecified secondary outcome only at the Barcelona node of the trial, where 352 participants were randomized. Retention rate was 92.6%. Primary endpoints were 2-year changes in BMD at the spine and the nondominant femoral neck, determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary endpoints were 2-year changes in bone turnover biomarkers (adrenocorticotropic hormone, Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor-1, osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin, osteopontin, sclerostin, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor-23), which were quantified in 211 randomly selected participants. The walnut diet versus the control diet had no effect on 2-year changes in BMD at the spine (0.15% vs. 0.35%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.632) and femoral neck (-0.90% vs. -0.70%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.653), or on bone turnover biomarkers. Results were similar in participants treated or not with bone resorption inhibitors or those with or without osteoporosis/osteopenia at inclusion. Compared with the usual diet, a diet enriched with walnuts at 15% of energy for 2&#x2009;years failed to improve BMD or circulating markers of bone metabolism in healthy older people.
