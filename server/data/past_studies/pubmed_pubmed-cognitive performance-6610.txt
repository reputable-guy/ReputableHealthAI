Study Title: RehaCom rehabilitation training improves a wide-range of cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis patients.

Study Summary:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that impairs cognitive performance. Attention, response control, working memory, and processing speed are highly impaired in MS. On the other hand, RehaCom is a computerized software that improves cognitive dysfunctions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of RehaCom on attention, response control, processing speed, working memory, visuospatial skills, and verbal/non-verbal executive functions in MS patients. Sixty patients were selected randomly and divided into control (&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) and experimental (&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) groups. Integrated Auditory Visual-2 (IVA-2), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) and The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) were used to assess cognitive functions. Patients in the experimental group were treated by RehaCom for 5&#x2009;weeks (two 60-min sessions per week). Cognitive performance of all patients in both groups was assessed at weeks 5 and 10 (post-test and follow-up stages, respectively). The results showed that RehaCom treatment improved all studied cognitive functions at the post-test stage. This effect also remained at the follow-up stage for some cognitive functions. In conclusion, treatment with RehaCom may have significant therapeutic effects on cognitive dysfunctions in MS patients.
