Study Title: The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Sexual Counseling on Sexual Distress, Attitude Toward Sexuality, and Body Image Concerns in Pregnant Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Sexual distress during pregnancy can cause a negative attitude toward sexuality during pregnancy, and this can be seen especially in conjunction with body image concerns. This study was conducted to determine the effects of mindfulness-based sexual counseling (MBSC) on sexual distress, attitudes toward sexuality, and body image concerns in pregnant women. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a sample of women who experienced sexual distress presenting to a Healthy Living Center in eastern Turkey. Women (N = 134) were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week, 8-session counseling program based on mindfulness (experimental group; n = 67) or treatment as usual (control group; n = 67). The primary outcome of the study, sexual distress, was assessed using the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised. Secondary outcomes included attitude toward sexuality, assessed using the Attitude Scale toward Sexuality during Pregnancy, and body image concerns, using the Body Image Concerns during Pregnancy Scale. Outcomes were compared postintervention, correcting for baseline using analysis of covariance. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04900194). Mean scores for sexual distress (7.69 vs 17.36; P < .001) and body image concerns (57.76 vs 73.88; P < .001) decreased significantly in the mindfulness group compared with the control group. Similarly, mean scores for attitudes toward sexuality significantly improved in the mindfulness group compared with the control group (133.52 vs 105.78; P < .05). MBSC is a promising strategy to help women experiencing sexual distress during pregnancy to reduce their levels of sexual distress, raise their positive attitudes toward sexuality, and lower their body image concerns. Larger clinical trials of MBSC are recommended to support introduction of MBSC into clinical practice.
