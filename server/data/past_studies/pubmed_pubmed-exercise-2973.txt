Study Title: The effect of home exercises with kinesiotaping on pain, functionality, and work performance in bus drivers with non-specific neck pain.

Study Summary:
Clinical research on the management and rehabilitation of work-related upper spinal pain in bus drivers is sparse, indicating a gap in knowledge and treatment strategies. This highlights the growing need for innovative approaches to rehabilitation programs in this area. To examine the effects of kinesio taping (KT) on pain, functionality, and work performance in bus drivers experiencing neck pain. The study involved 44 participants who were randomised into two different groups: the exercise group (n= 22) and the kinesio tape group (n= 22), with participants in both groups undertaking exercise interventions. Evaluations were made before and after 6 weeks of treatment. At the end of the 6-week, the participants' ROM, pain evaluations and functional scales were evaluated with disability, and work functionality. Neck pain severity decreased in both groups (p< 0.001 for each value), but there was no difference between the groups (p: 0.071). When disability scores were evaluated, improvement was noted in both groups (p: 0.001 for each value), but no statistically significant difference was found (p: 0.754). When the improvements in ROM values before and after the treatment were examined, the difference between the groups was recorded only in the neck extension ROM value (p: 0.011). Significant improvement was noted in all sub-steps of job performance in both groups (p< 0.05). KT added to ergonomic training and home exercise programmes is effective in controlling work-related musculoskeletal pain in drivers with neck pain. However, the addition of KT to exercise therapy was found to be no more effective than exercise therapy alone in improving pain control, functionality and work performance.
