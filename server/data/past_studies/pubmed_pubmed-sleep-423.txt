Study Title: Gut microbiota and sleep: Interaction mechanisms and therapeutic prospects.

Study Summary:
Sleep is crucial for wellness, and emerging research reveals a profound connection to gut microbiota. This review explores the bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota and sleep, exploring the mechanisms involved and the therapeutic opportunities it presents. The gut-brain axis serves as a conduit for the crosstalk between gut microbiota and the central nervous system, with dysbiosis in the microbiota impairing sleep quality and. Diet, circadian rhythms, and immune modulation all play a part. Specific gut bacteria, likeand, enhance sleep through serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid production, exemplifying direct microbiome influence. Conversely, sleep deprivation reduces beneficial bacteria, exacerbating dysbiosis. Probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and fecal transplants show therapeutic potential, backed by animal and human research, yet require further study on safety and long-term effects. Unraveling this intricate link paves the way for tailored sleep therapies, utilizing microbiome manipulation to improve sleep and health. Accelerated research is essential to fully tap into this promising field for sleep disorder management.
