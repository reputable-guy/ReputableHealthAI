Study Title: Evaluation of the effect of delivery type on dynamic thiol-disulfide balance: a prospective randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Thiols play an essential role in eliminating oxidative stress in cells. We aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress occurring during labor with thiol-disulfide balance. A total of 97 healthy pregnant women in the 37th-41st gestational weeks who underwent delivery between June 2021 and August 2022 were included in the study. Elective cesarean section group 1 (n=33), vaginal deliveries group 2 (n=29), and cesarean section due to cephalopelvic disproportion group 3 (n=35) were determined. Blood samples were taken before delivery, and from the umbilical artery just after the fetus and placenta were delivered. Serum native thiol (&#x3bc;mol/L), total thiol (&#x3bc;mol/L), and disulfide (&#x3bc;mol/L) were measured. Disulfide/native thiol (%), disulfide/total thiol (%), and native thiol/total thiol (%) ratios were calculated. No significant difference was observed in thiol values in maternal blood (p>0.05). There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of native/total thiol (p=0.017), disulfide/total thiol (%) (p=0.018), and disulfide/native thiol (%) (p=0.018) in cord blood. In the literature, evidence concerning the impact of the mode of delivery on the level of neonatal and maternal oxidative stress is inconsistent. It is not clear whether parturition accompanied by pain, as in spontaneous vaginal delivery, poses more oxidative stress than a planned operative delivery. Prospective studies in larger cohorts are needed to better understand the impact of oxidative stress on pregnant women and neonates.
