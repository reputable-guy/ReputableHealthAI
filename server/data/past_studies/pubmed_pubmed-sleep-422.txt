Study Title: Effectiveness of Pranic Healing as complementary therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms and sleep: Single-blind randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) commonly affects older men, leading to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that affect sleep and quality of life. This study evaluates the effect of Pranic Healing (PH) as a complementary therapy for bothersome LUTS by normalising biofield energy centres called Chakras. A single blind trial involving 76 men with LUTS was conducted, randomised into Medication-only (MED) and Medication-plus-Pranic Healing (MEDPH) groups. The MEDPH received PH sessions twice weekly for 5 weeks. The study compared MED (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) and MEDPH (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;36) participants, finding significant improvements in IPSS scores (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;.001) in both groups. The MEDPH group showed a greater reduction in incomplete bladder emptying and intermittency. The post void residual volume increased significantly in the MED group (Wilcoxon Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.335, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.02), while the MEDPH group reduced non-significantly. Sleep quality index improved significantly (McNemar=.013) in the MEDPH group, while the MED group showed no significant change. Subjective sleep quality, duration, and latency improved significantly in the MEDPH group. Healers reported improved energy balance in chakras of MEDPH group. Perceived energy by healers in lower chakra relates to urinary parameters. PH could alleviate LUTS, enhancing quality of life due to urination, and improved sleep, among moderate BPH patients. This study has been registered under the Clinical Trial Registry of India. (CTRI No: CTRI/2023/01/049004).
