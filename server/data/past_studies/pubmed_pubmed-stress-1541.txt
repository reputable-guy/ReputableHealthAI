Study Title: The effect of laughter yoga and music intervention on depression, anxiety, and stress in the Rafsanjan-Iran aged: a randomized clinical trial study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to compare the effects of laughter yoga and music intervention on depression, anxiety, and stress in aged individuals referred to Rafsanjan health centers. In this 3-arm randomized clinical trial, 91 depressed aged participants aged 60-75&#x2009;years, referred to Rafsanjan health centers, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The study followed a parallel group design with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The laughter yoga intervention was conducted twice a week for eight weeks, and music intervention consisted of 30-min sessions twice a week for eight weeks. The control group received no intervention ('No treatment' concurrent control). Assessments for depressive symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety, and stress were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and one month after the intervention. A total of 84 patients were analyzed in three groups included the laughter yoga intervention (&#x2009;=&#x2009;31), music intervention (&#x2009;=&#x2009;25), or control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;28). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant decrease in depressive and anxiety symptoms (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) from pre-test to post-test and one-month follow-ups. The greatest impact of the intervention programs on stress was observed immediately after the intervention, but stress increased one month after the intervention programs (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.125). Both laughter yoga and music interventions proved effective in improving depression, anxiety, and stress in aged individuals. However, laughter yoga intervention demonstrated a superior effect and better acceptance among elders.
