Study Title: Effectiveness of a 12-week telerehabilitation training in people with long COVID: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Telerehabilitation has been developed and applied for years for cardiac and pulmonary diseases with good clinical outcomes. However, its application to participants with long COVID remains limited. To investigate the effectiveness of a 12-week telerehabilitation training program in participants with long COVID. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and secondary outcomes were physical activity (PA) amounts, exercise self-efficacy, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). A parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Eligible participants with long COVID (n = 182) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG received 12 weeks of telerehabilitation training with weekly remote monitoring for exercise maintenance and support. The CG received PA counseling only. CRF, PA amounts, exercise self-efficacy, sleep quality, and HRQOL were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the intervention effects by examining the interaction between time and group. One hundred twenty-two participants (67 %) completed the study, and 182 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The EG had greater walking behavior (&#x3b2; = -763.3, p < 0.001), total amount of PA (&#x3b2;= -711, p = 0.003), exercise self-efficacy (&#x3b2; = -1.19, p < 0.001), and better sleep quality (&#x3b2; = 1.69, p = 0.012) after the 12-weeks of telerehabilitation training than the CG. However, there were no significant differences in any CRF parameters or HRQOL at 12 weeks between the EG and CG. Telerehabilitation training offers a personalized and convenient approach that can increase exercise willingness and PA amounts and improve sleep quality. These findings underscore the potential benefits of telerehabilitation training for promoting healthier lifestyles and improving overall health outcomes. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05205460) on January 25, 2022.
