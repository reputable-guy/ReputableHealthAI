Study Title: Early sleep intervention for improving infant sleep quality: a randomized controlled trial, preliminary result.

Study Summary:
Healthy sleep issues should provide to family within first 6 months of infant's life. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of early sleep intervention on nighttime sleep quality. Eligible infants aged 4 months&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2 weeks were randomized to receive early sleep intervention or usual care. Data on sleep variables were obtained via parental interview at baseline and 6 months of age. Using logistic regression to analyze the efficacy of early sleep intervention. At baseline, 335 eligible infants were enrolled and randomized. In total, 306 participants were final analyzed: early sleep intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;148) and the usual care group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;158). The early sleep intervention group had a significantly longer nighttime sleep duration and a shorter night waking duration than the usual care group (585.20&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;80.38&#xa0;min vs. 496.14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;87.78&#xa0;min, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001 and 61.01&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;36.38&#xa0;min vs. 89.72&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;45.54&#xa0;min, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). At 6 months of age, the early sleep intervention group had a longer night sleep duration (&#x2265;&#x2009;4&#xa0;h/time) than the usual care group (adjusted odds ratio: 2.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.34-4.28). Early sleep intervention should be recommended to infants at 4 months of age as a part of well childcare to improve infant sleep quality. Thai Clinical Trials Registry (thaiclinicaltrial.org).
