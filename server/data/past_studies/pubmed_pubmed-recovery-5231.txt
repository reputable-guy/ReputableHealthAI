Study Title: Effect of Gum Chewing Training on Masseter Muscle Oxygen Dynamics.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to clarify the effect of 1&#xa0;month of gum chewing (GCh) training on masseter muscle oxygen dynamics and determine its effectiveness in improving muscle endurance and fatigue. A total of 16 healthy adult subjects were included in this study. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: control and training groups (eight subjects each). GCh training using prototype gum of moderate hardness was performed for 10 min (5 min for each side) three times a day before each meal for 30&#xa0;days. Clenching effects were evaluated before and after interventions. Masseter muscle oxygen dynamics were measured using spatially resolved near-infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, masseter muscle fatigue was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). After training, a significant increase was observed in total haemoglobin and oxygenated haemoglobin during clenching, and the 1/2 recovery time was significantly shortened. The changes in the VAS score showed a decreasing trend after training. In conclusion, 1&#xa0;month of GCh training changed masseter oxygen dynamics during clenching and recovery and improved muscle aerobic capacity.
