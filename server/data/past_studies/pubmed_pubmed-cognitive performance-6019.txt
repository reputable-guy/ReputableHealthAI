Study Title: Effects of different doses of caffeine on cognitive performance in healthy physically active individuals.

Study Summary:
Caffeine is a potent central nervous system stimulant that increases the activity of the prefrontal cortex and can improve various cognitive skills. An improvement in these cognitive skills can lead to further benefits in athletic performance. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the dose-response of caffeine on cognitive performance. This study aimed to determine the effects of different doses of caffeine on sport-related cognitive aspects. Twenty-nine healthy physically active young adults were recruited. All participants completed three trials under the following conditions: (a) placebo, (b) 3&#xa0;mg/kg, or (c) 6&#xa0;mg/kg body mass of caffeine. In each trial, different cognitive abilities were evaluated with the following battery of tests: reaction time (Dynavision&#x2122; D2), anticipation (Bassin Anticipation Timer), sustained attention (Go/No-Go and Eriksen Flanker Test) and memory tests. Moreover, the side effects and the perceived sensation index were recorded 24&#xa0;h after each test. Reaction time only improved following 6&#xa0;mg/kg of caffeine intake (Physical reaction time: -0.04&#xa0;s, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.01&#xa0;s, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5; Motor reaction time: -0.04&#xa0;s, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01&#xa0;s, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6) compared to the placebo condition. Anticipation, sustained attention, and memory were not affected after either caffeine dose intake (all P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). In addition, the 6&#xa0;mg/kg dose of caffeine augmented the occurrence of the side effects of increased activeness (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046) and nervousness (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Acute intake of 6&#xa0;mg/kg caffeine is effective in improving reaction time despite increasing the occurrence of side effects in healthy physically active young adults. This study has been registered in ClinicalTrials whose ID is: NCT05995314 (2023-08-08).
