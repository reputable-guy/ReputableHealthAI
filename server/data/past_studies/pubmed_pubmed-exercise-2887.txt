Study Title: Impact of rehabilitation unit-based physical activity therapy versus symptomatic supportive treatment on older patients with advanced cancer: a non-randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Relatively few studies have investigated the effects of rehabilitation-based physical activity therapy as a treatment for older patients with advanced cancer. This study evaluated the effects of individualized precise and structured exercise interventions, prescribed by a rehabilitation physician, on fatigue, quality of life (QOL), and physical activity in older patients with advanced cancer. After admission to the rehabilitation department, older cancer patients were divided into groups receiving conventional symptomatic supportive therapy (SST) or physical activity therapy plus conventional symptomatic supportive therapy (PAT). The SST group was given symptomatic supportive treatment, exercised on their own, and were observed at home after their symptoms improved. The PAT group was required to implement physical exercise along with SST, involving 30&#xa0;min of moderate-intensity exercise per day and 5&#xa0;days per week, and were discharged after 4&#xa0;weeks and instructed to continue to exercise outside the hospital. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) at 4 and 8&#xa0;weeks was the primary endpoint of the study, while the secondary endpoints included patients' QOL, physical activity, and exercise adherence rate. Sixty-five patients were included; 37 (56.92%) chose to enter the PAT group, and 28 (43.08%) chose to enter the SST group. After 4 and 8&#xa0;weeks of treatment, CRF relief and QOL improvement were significantly better in the PAT group than in the SST group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), whereas global health status did not differ between the two treatment groups (T1: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.84; T2: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.92). Mild physical activity significantly increased for the PAT group at T1 and T2 (T1: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03; T2: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). At the T2 time point, the PAT group exhibited a higher level of participation in moderate-intensity physical activities as well as a higher total leisure activity score (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Thirty-three patients (94.29%) completed the PAT exercise program during hospitalization. Only four (12.12%) patients achieved moderate-intensity exercise, while the other 29 (87.88%) patients were able to continue exercising after their exercise intensity was decreased. Implementation of precise and individualized exercise interventions, prescribed by the rehabilitation team, can lead to the reduction of CRF and improvement of QOL, and change in behavior related to physical activity.
