Study Title: Impact of diverse aerobic exercise plans on glycemic control, lipid levels, and functional activity in stroke patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to assess the effects of Low-to-Moderate Intensity Continuous Training (LMICT), Moderate-Intensity Interval Training (MIIT), and Reduced-Exertion High-Intensity Training (REHIT) on blood glucose regulation, functional recovery, and lipid levels in individuals who have experienced a stroke and are diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Forty-two T2DM stroke patients were randomly allocated to four groups: LMICT, MIIT, REHIT, and a control group (CON). Participants continuously monitored their blood glucose levels throughout the intervention using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. The study comprised two exercise intervention cycles: the first lasting from Day 3 to Day 14 and the second from Day 15 to Day 28, with the initial two days serving as contrasting periods. Primary outcomes encompassed CGM-derived blood glucose measurements, the Barthel Index (BI), Fugl-Meyer Assessment lower-extremity subscale (FMA-LE), and alterations in triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c). Compared with the CON, the MIIT group showed significant improvements in mean glucose (MG), glucose standard deviation (SD), time above range (TAR), and time in range (TIR). The REHIT group exhibited significantly reduced time below range (TBR), glucose SD, and coefficient of variation (CV). Regarding lipid levels, although the REHIT group achieved a significant reduction in TG levels compared with the CON, the overall effects of LMICT, MIIT, and REHIT on lipid profiles were relatively modest. Concerning functional recovery, the REHIT group significantly improved the BI and FMA-LE. Although the short-term quantitative impact of exercise on lipid levels may be limited, both REHIT and MIIT significantly improved glycemic management and reduced glucose variability in post-stroke patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Additionally, REHIT notably enhanced functional recovery.
