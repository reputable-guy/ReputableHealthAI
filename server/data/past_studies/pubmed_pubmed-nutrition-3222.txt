Study Title: Randomized Controlled Trial of 60 minutes for Health With Rapid Antiretroviral Therapy to Reengage Persons With HIV Who Are Out of Care.

Study Summary:
Many persons with HIV remain out of care (PWH-OOC). We evaluated InstaCare, a complex intervention integrating the brief behavioral intervention 60 minutes for Health with the rapid restart of antiretroviral therapy (rapid ART). Prospective open-label randomized controlled trial among PWH-OOC in San Diego, USA. PWH-OOC were randomized 1:1 to InstaCare or a time-and-attention control integrating a diet-and-nutrition behavioral intervention also with rapid ART initiation (restart &#x2264;7 days from enrollment). All participants had access to support services (free transport, HIV peer navigation, adherence counseling, and linkage to care) and primary care services (mental health, case management, social work, medication-assisted treatment, and specialist pharmacy). The primary outcomes were viral suppression (<50 copies/mL) and re-engagement with care (&#x2265;2 HIV care visits >90 days apart) by 24 weeks. Outcomes were reported on an intention-to-treat basis. Between November 2020 and August 2022, 52 PWH-OOC were enrolled. Baseline substance use in the preceding month (49%), unstable housing (51%), moderate/severe depression (49%), and moderate/severe anxiety (41.7%) were prevalent. Rapid ART was provided for all participants. At week 24, the proportion with HIV viral load <50 copies/mL was 37.3% (19/51) (InstaCare 28.0%, control 46.2%, P = 0.25). Fourteen (27.5%) were engaged with care (InstaCare 7/25 [28.0%], control 7/26 [26.9%], P = 1.00). Most participants (94%) reported low or very low emotional distress associated with rapid ART. Study lost to follow-up by week 24 was high (23/51, 45%). The InstaCare complex intervention did not improve viral suppression or reengagement with care among PWH-OOC. Investigation of high-intensity, individually adapted interventions is needed among PWH-OOC.
