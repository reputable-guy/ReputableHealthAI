Study Title: Is repeated mistake-making an effective treatment strategy for perfectionism? Findings from a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Perfectionism has been linked to self-criticism, procrastination, and psychological disorders. In a previous study, an exposure-based treatment for perfectionism (ETP), which included exposures targeted at concern over mistakes, showed positive outcomes when compared to waitlist. The aim of this study was to further investigate ETP by comparing it to a stress-management condition and assessing durability of treatment effects by conducting a one-month follow-up assessment. Eighty-five individuals with elevated perfectionism were randomly assigned to receive ETP (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;43) or a stress management treatment (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42). ETP involved repeatedly practicing mistake-making by completing computerized tasks engineered to cause individuals to make mistakes. The stress management condition included listening to videos and answering questions about healthy habits, such as diet, exercise, and sleep, as well as viewing calming videos. Participants completed eight treatment sessions as well as baseline, post-test, and one month follow-up self-report questionnaires. Contrary to predictions, compared to ETP, stress management led to significantly lower overall perfectionism, depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety at post and significantly lower depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety at follow-up. Further, individuals who completed ETP did not habituate to the exposure tasks, but distress increased from the first to the last treatment session. The duration of treatment was relatively brief. This study highlights the importance of using active psychological control conditions in treatment outcome studies and the need to test various components of treatments for perfectionism to observe what may be effective or even potentially iatrogenic.
