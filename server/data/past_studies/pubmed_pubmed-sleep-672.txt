Study Title: Effect of acupuncture combined with Ningshen mixture on climacteric insomnia: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
In recent years, the incidence of menopause insomnia has gradually increased, seriously affecting women's physical and mental health. Total 82 climacteric insomnia patients received from January 2021 to January 2023 were divided into 2 groups at random. In control group, 41 cases received conventional Western medicine, and in study group, 41 cases received acupuncture combined with Ningshen mixture. Clinical effectiveness of both groups was compared, neurotransmitter levels, TCM syndrome integral and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were assessed in both groups. Meanwhile, the recurrence rate and safety were evaluated in 2 groups. The curative effect in study group was better than that in control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). After treatment, the expressions of 5-hydroxytryptamine and &#x3b2;-endorphin (&#x3b2;-EP) in study group were higher than control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); TCM syndrome scores and PSQI scores in study group were lower than control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). The total recurrence rate in study group was obviously lower than control group at 3 months after treatment (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). There were no serious adverse reactions in both group, and no distinct difference between 2 groups was found (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). Acupuncture united with Ningshen mixture has a significant therapeutic effect and high safety in climacteric insomnia patients. It can effectively improve the neurotransmitter levels, clinical symptoms and sleep quality, and reduce the recurrence rate of climacteric insomnia patients, which has high clinical application value and is worthy of clinical promotion.
