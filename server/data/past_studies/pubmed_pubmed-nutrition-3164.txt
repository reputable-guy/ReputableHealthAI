Study Title: Effect of post-discharge online kangaroo care training on breastfeeding self-efficacy in mothers with preterm infants: A randomised controlled study.

Study Summary:
Preterm newborns face many health problems due to their incomplete intrauterine development and the immaturity of their systems. One of these problems concerns nutrition. This study aimed to determine the effect of online kangaroo care (KC) training provided post-discharge on breastfeeding self-efficacy in mothers with preterm infants. This research was conducted as an experimental study with a randomised control group. Two groups were formed: kangaroo care and control. The sample of the study consisted of 68 mothers of preterm infants. The mothers in the KC group were given online KC training after discharge from the hospital. The mothers were asked to perform KC regularly, at least once a day, for 20&#x2009;min, 7&#x2009;days a week. The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale was administered to the mothers before and after training. The results of the study revealed that the difference between the pre-test and post-test breastfeeding self-efficacy scores was statistically significantly higher among the mothers who received online KC training compared with the controls (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). According to the results of our research carried out in this context, the mothers who received online KC training had increased breastfeeding self-efficacy compared to those in the control group.
