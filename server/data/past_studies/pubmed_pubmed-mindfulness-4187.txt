Study Title: Effects of mindfulness and movement on affect and vitality.

Study Summary:
Increasing levels of distress and barriers to healthcare have coincided with increasing use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). While mindfulness and movement interventions may improve wellbeing, little research has compared the effectiveness of these two approaches. This single intervention study aimed to (1) explore the effects of two brief, online, self-administered mindfulness and movement interventions on affect and vitality, and (2) establish whether changes in affect and vitality could be predicted by age, gender, general distress, previous CAM experience and enjoyment of the intervention. Participants (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;62) were randomly allocated to follow a brief online mindfulness or movement intervention. Levels of affect (using PANAS) and subjective vitality (using the Subjective Vitality Scale) were measured pre and post intervention. Demographics, experience with CAM and general distress (using the DASS-21) were collected pre intervention, while level of enjoyment (using the ENJOY scale) was measured post intervention. Open-text responses gathered qualitative data on participant experience. Participants completing the mindfulness intervention reported increased vitality and decreased positive and negative affect. Those completing the movement intervention reported increased vitality and positive affect and decreased negative affect. Higher DASS-21 levels were predictive of greater reductions in negative affect. Higher levels of enjoyment were predictive of greater increases in positive affect and vitality. Differences between mindfulness and movement interventions may indicate that they could have targeted applications. While further research is necessary, these brief, online interventions may provide a sustainable, accessible self-management and wellbeing intervention.
