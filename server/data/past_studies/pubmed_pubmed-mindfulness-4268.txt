Study Title: Effects of Mindfulness Based Interventions in Adults and Older Adults Caregivers of Patients with Early Stage Alzheimer's Disease: A Randomized Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Many studies have highlighted the effect of training with mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on the psycho-physical rebalancing of patients suffering from various pathologies, and their families. In this study, the effect of a training with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on quality of life and emotion regulation (depression) was verified in caregivers (CGs) of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease at early stage (AD-P). In this randomized controlled study, 22 CGs (age&#x2265;60 years) were treated with MBIs, in particular MBSR, and 22 CGs had no treatment. Tests (T0-T1 six months) included: SF 36-Quality of Life (QoL); Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI); FACIT-Spiritual-Well-Being; Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Everyday Cognition scales; and Mini-Mental State Examination (for AD-P). Significant differences emerged between T0 and T1 for CGs with MBSR in the following dimensions: Depression-BDI (p&#x200a;>&#x200a;0.001), Burden CBI-Total (0.001), CBI-Time dependent burden (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001), CBI-Developmental burden (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001), CBI-Physical burden (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001); and pain (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.002) all decreased; while CBI-Social burden (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.004), QoL-Health Role Limitation (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.000), QoL-Role-Limitation-Emotional-Problem (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.000), QoL-Energy-fatigue (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.000), QoL-Emotional Well-Being (p&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.001), QoL-Social Well Being (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.010), and QoL-General Health (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.004) increased. The control group of untreated CG showed a significant worsening in the dimensions of Physical functioning (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.036) and pain (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.047). AD-CGs treated with MBI reduced their burden and depression and experienced an improvement in all the dimensions of quality of life.
