Study Title: Clinical pharmacology and tolerability of REC-994, a redox-cycling nitroxide compound, in randomized phase 1 dose-finding studies.

Study Summary:
Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) has variable clinical symptoms, including potentially fatal hemorrhagic stroke. Treatment options are very limited, presenting a large unmet need. REC-994 (also known as tempol), identified as a potential treatment through an unbiased drug discovery platform, is hypothesized to treat CCMs through a reduction in superoxide, a reactive oxygen species. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of REC-994 in healthy volunteers. Single- and multiple-ascending dose (SAD and MAD, respectively) studies were conducted in adult volunteers (ages 18-55). SAD study participants received an oral dose of REC-994 or placebo. MAD study participants were randomized 3:1 to oral doses of REC-994 or matching placebo, once daily for 10&#x2009;days. Thirty-two healthy volunteers participated in the SAD study and 52 in the MAD study. Systemic exposure increased in proportion to REC-994 dose after single doses of 50-800&#x2009;mg and after 10&#x2009;days of dosing over the 16-fold dose range of 50-800&#x2009;mg. Median Tand mean twere independent of dose in both studies, and the solution formulation was more rapidly absorbed. REC-994 was well tolerated. Treatment-emergent adverse effects across both studies were mild and transient and resolved by the end of the study. REC-994 has a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated in single and multiple doses up to 800&#x2009;mg with no dose-limiting adverse effects identified. Data support conducting a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with symptomatic CCM.
