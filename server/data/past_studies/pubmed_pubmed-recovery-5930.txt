Study Title: Postpartum uterine involution promoted by penetrating-moxibustion therapy: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To observe the effect of penetrating-moxibustion therapy on postpartum uterine involution. Eighty puerpera were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 40 cases in each one. In the control group, oxytocin injection was administered by intravenous drip, 20 U each time, once daily. In the observation group, on the base of the treatment as the control group, the penetrating-moxibustion therapy was used at Shenque (GV 8), Qihai (CV 6) and Guanyuan (CV 4), 30 min to 40 min each time, twice a day. The intervention of each group started from the first day after childbirth and lasted 3 days. The uterine volume before and after treatment, and in 42 days of postpartum, the height decrease of the fundus of the uterus, the score of visual analogue scale (VAS) for uterine contraction, the volume of lochia rubra in 1 to 3 days of treatment, and lochia duration were compared between the two groups; and the clinical effect was evaluated. The uterine volume in the observation group was smaller than that of the control group after treatment (<0.01). In 1 to 3 days of treatment, the height decrease of the fundus of the uterus in the observation group was larger (<0.01), VAS scores of uterine contraction were lower (0.05,0.01), the lochia rubra volume was less (<0.01) than those in the control group. The duration of lochia rubra and lochia was shorter (<0.01) in the observation group when compared with that of the control group. The favorable rate of uterine involution in the observation group was 95.0% (38/40), higher than that of the control group (75.0%, 30/40,0.05). Penetrating-moxibustion therapy accelerates the recovery of the uterine volume, relieves uterine contraction, shortens the duration of lochia, reduces the lochia volume and promotes the postpartum uterine involution.
