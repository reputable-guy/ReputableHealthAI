Study Title: A profile approach to physical activity levels: what's intensity got to do with reasons and motives for exercise?

Study Summary:
Despite the well-known benefits of physical activity (PA), non-communicable disease and premature mortality rates among adults continue to rise. The relationship between adults' goals and exercise-specific motivation on the type of PA intensity one engages remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify physical activity (PA) profiles based on frequency and intensity (i.e., levels of PA) in an adult sample. A secondary purpose was to examine how the PA profiles differ on the reasons people have for exercising and behavioral regulation. A Cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1,169 (46.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;16.7&#xa0;years) participants solicited from a hospital-affiliated wellness center, social media promotions, and a research volunteer registry. The International PA Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to determine frequency, intensity, and time spent engaging in PA. Additionally, the Reasons to Exercise (REX-2) scale, the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 (BREQ-3), and demographics were assessed. K-cluster analyses were performed to identify profiles based on PA levels using the IPAQ guidelines. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to assess profile differences. Five distinct PA clusters were derived, and defined as: a Low, Walking, Moderate Intensity, High Intensity, and Sitting cluster (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). These clusters differed significantly (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) from each other with respect to motivation, the reasons adults have for exercise, and PA levels. The results from this study support the important role of psychological factors such as motivation and reasons for exercise on behavioral outcomes (i.e., physical activity). For future research investigating adults PA- related behaviors, whether it be on adults starting a new exercise program or for PA maintenance, it may be beneficial to develop programs that encourage participants to reflect on the reasons they identify as important for exercising, and how such reasons contribute to their overall PA engagement behaviors.
