Study Title: Dual Effects of Self-Compassion on Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and Posttraumatic Growth: The Roles of Trauma-Related Shame and Guilt.

Study Summary:
Previous studies have shown that self-compassion can alleviate posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and promote posttraumatic growth (PTG). However, only a few studies explored the dual effects of its positive and negative components on PTSS and PTG. Also, the emotional mechanisms between self-compassion and PTSS/PTG remain unclear. Thus, with the three-wave longitudinal design, we examined the mediating role of trauma-related shame and guilt between self-compassion and PTSS/PTG among traumatized Chinese college students. 782 Chinese college students (467 females;= 18.98,&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.37) who had experienced traumatic events within the previous six months of the initial assessment were included in the study. In the direct effect model, compassionate self-responding (CSR) negatively predicted PTSS and positively predicted PTG. In contrast, uncompassionate self-responding (USR) positively predicted both PTSS and PTG. In the indirect model, CSR negatively predicted PTSS through trauma-related shame and guilt, but also negatively predicted PTG through trauma-related guilt. USR positively predicted PTSS through trauma-related shame and guilt and positively predicted PTG through trauma-related guilt. Thus, CSR can benefit posttraumatic college students by alleviating PTSS and promoting PTG, and USR may also have an adaptive side. Still, we should focus on the maladaptive and adaptive sides of trauma-related emotions in the intervention of posttraumatic college students.
