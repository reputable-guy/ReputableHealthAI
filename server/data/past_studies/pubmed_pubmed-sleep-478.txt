Study Title: Cardio-metabolic health effects of CPAP treatment for sleep apnoea during weight loss: A randomised controlled pilot trial.

Study Summary:
This study assessed whether the addition of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during weight loss would enhance cardiometabolic health improvements in patients with obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). Patients with overweight or obesity, pre-diabetes and moderatesevere OSA were randomised to receive CPAP therapy with a weight loss programme (CPAP+WL) or a weight loss programme alone (WL alone). 2-hour glucose assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test. 24&#xa0;hr blood pressure, body composition (DEXA) and fasting blood markers. 17 patients completed 3-month follow-up assessments (8 CPAP+WL and 9 WL alone). Overall, participants in both groups lost &#x223c;12&#xa0;kg which reduced polysomnography determined OSA severity by &#x223c;45&#xa0;%. In the CPAP+WL group, CPAP use (compliance 5.29 hrs/night) did not improve any outcome above WL alone. There was no improvement in 2-hour glucose in either group. However, in the pooled (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17) analysis there were overall improvements in most outcomes including insulin sensitivity (.000965 units, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.008), sleep systolic BP (- 16.2&#xa0;mmHg, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.0003), sleep diastolic BP (-9.8&#xa0;mmHg, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02), wake diastolic BP (- 4.3&#xa0;mmHg, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.03) and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Score -3.2, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.0003). In addition, there were reductions in glucose area under the curve (-230 units, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.009), total (-0.86&#xa0;mmol/L, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006) and LDL cholesterol (-0.58&#xa0;mmol/L, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007), triglycerides (-0.75&#xa0;mmol/L, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004), fat mass (-7.6&#xa0;kg, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.0001) and abdominal fat (-310&#xa0;cm3, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.0001). Weight loss reduced OSA and improved sleepiness and cardiometabolic health. These improvements were not further enhanced by using CPAP. Results suggest weight loss should be the primary focus of treatment for patients with OSA and obesity.
