Study Title: Effects of spinal mobilisation in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of spinal mobilisation on curvature magnitude, angle of trunk rotation (ATR) and pulmonary function in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Conducted as a double-blind randomised controlled trial, the study included 40 patients with AIS (Cobb angles 10&#xb0;-25&#xb0;) randomised to experimental (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20; female&#x2009;=&#x2009;12, male&#x2009;=&#x2009;8; age&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.8 mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD) and control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20; female&#x2009;=&#x2009;13, male&#x2009;=&#x2009;7; age&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.85&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.81 mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD) groups. The experimental group received spinal mobilisation for 30&#x2009;min per session followed by 60&#x2009;min of core stabilisation exercises (CSE), twice a week for 10&#x2009;weeks. The control group received CSE only at the same frequency and duration. Evaluation of Cobb angle, ATR and pulmonary function tests (PEF: Peak Expiratory Flow, FEV1: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1&#x2009;s, FVC: Forced Vital Capacity, and FEV1/FVC: Tiffeneau index) were performed at baseline and after the intervention. Both groups showed significant improvements in Cobb angle, ATR, PEF and FVC, with the experimental group showing significantly greater improvements in Cobb angle (-7.65&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.17) and ATR (-2.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.43) compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In addition, while the control group showed no change in FEV1, the experimental group showed improvement. There was no change in FEV1/FVC ratio in either group. These results indicate that adding spinal mobilisation to treatment sessions can effectively reduce the magnitude of curvature and improve scoliosis-related problems in the short term.
