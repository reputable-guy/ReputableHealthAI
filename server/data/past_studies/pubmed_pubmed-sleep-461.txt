Study Title: Caregivers' Internet-Delivered Insomnia Intervention Engagement and Benefit: SHUTi-CARE Trial Primary Quantitative Analysis.

Study Summary:
Delivering insomnia treatment by the Internet holds promise for increasing care access to family caregivers, but their ability to adhere to and benefit from such fully-automated programs has not been rigorously tested. This fully-powered, single-group trial tested whether characteristics of the caregiving context influence high-intensity caregivers' engagement with and benefit from an empirically validated Internet intervention for insomnia. At baseline, caregivers providing unpaid time- and responsibility-intensive care who reported insomnia (N = 100; age M = 52.82 [SD = 13.10], 75% non-Hispanic white, 66% &#x2265;college degree) completed questionnaires about caregiving context and sleep, then 10 prospectively-collected online daily sleep diaries. Caregivers then received access to SHUTi (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet), which has no caregiver-specific content, for 9 weeks, followed by post-assessment (questionnaires, diaries). Engagement was tracked by the SHUTi delivery system. Sixty caregivers completed SHUTi, 22 initiated but did not complete SHUTi, and 18 did not initiate SHUTi. Caregivers were more likely to use SHUTi (than not use SHUTi) when their care recipient (CR) had worse functioning, and were more likely to complete SHUTi when supporting more CR activities of daily living (ADL; ps&#x2005;<&#x2005;.03). Higher caregiver guilt, more CR problem behaviors, and being bedpartners with the CR related to more improved sleep outcomes, whereas supporting more CR instrumental ADL related to less improvement (ps&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Factors associated with greater caregiving burden, including greater CR impairment and caregiving guilt, were generally associated with better engagement and outcomes. Caregivers with substantial burdens can adhere to and benefit from a fully automated insomnia program without caregiver-specific tailoring.
