Study Title: Ketone monoester attenuates oxygen desaturation during weighted ruck exercise under acute hypoxic exposure but does not impact cognitive performance.

Study Summary:
Acute ingestion of exogenous ketone supplements in the form of a (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (R-BD R-&#x3b2;HB) ketone monoester (KME) can attenuate declines in oxygen availability during hypoxic exposure and might impact cognitive performance at rest and in response to moderate-intensity exercise. In a single-blind randomized crossover design, 16 males performed assessments of cognitive performance before and during hypoxic exposure with moderate exercise [2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;20&#xa0;min weighted ruck (&#x223c;22&#xa0;kg) at 3.2&#xa0;km/h at 10% incline] in a normobaric altitude chamber (4572&#xa0;m, 11.8% O). The R-BD R-&#x3b2;HB KME (573&#xa0;mg/kg) or a calorie- and taste-matched placebo (&#x223c;50&#xa0;g maltodextrin) were co-ingested with 40&#xa0;g of dextrose before exposure to hypoxia. The R-&#x3b2;HB concentrations were rapidly elevated and sustained (>3&#xa0;mM; P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) by KME. The decline in oxygen saturation during hypoxic exposure was attenuated in KME conditions by 2.4%-4.2% (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) compared with placebo. Outcomes of cognitive performance tasks, in the form of the Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA) code substitution task, the Stroop color and word task, and a shooting simulation, did not differ between trials before and during hypoxic exposure. These data suggest that the acute exogenous ketosis induced by KME ingestion can attenuate declining blood oxygen saturation during acute hypoxic exposure both at rest and during moderate-intensity exercise, but this did not translate into differences in cognitive performance before or after exercise in the conditions investigated.
