Study Title: From pain level to pain experience: redefining acute pain assessment to enhance understanding of chronic postsurgical pain.

Study Summary:
Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) significantly impairs quality of life and poses a substantial healthcare burden, affecting up to a quarter of patients undergoing surgery. Although acute pain is recognised as a predictor for CPSP development, the role of patient experience remains underexplored. This study examines the predictive value of patient experience alongside traditional risk factors for CPSP after orthopaedic surgery. An exploratory analysis was conducted on 294 patients from a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing continuous perineural analgesia and single-injection nerve block in ambulatory orthopaedic surgeries. Patient experience was assessed using the Evaluation du Vecu de l'Anesth&#xe9;sie G&#xe9;n&#xe9;rale (EVAN-G) validated questionnaire. Factors associated with CPSP at 90 days after surgery were identified through univariate and multivariate analyses, incorporating patient-reported outcomes and classical variables. Out of 219 patients with complete data, 63 (29%) developed CPSP at day 90. Multivariate analysis revealed a poor pain experience, as assessed by the pain dimension of EVAN-G on postoperative day 2, as an independent predictor of CPSP (odds ratio 6.45, 95% confidence interval 1.65-25.26, P<0.01). Poor pain experience was associated with an augmented risk of CPSP. This study underscores the role of patient-reported outcomes, specifically the pain experience dimension captured by the EVAN-G scale, in prediction of CPSP 90 days after surgery. It suggests a shift from conventional assessments of pain intensity to a comprehensive understanding of pain experience, advocating for tailored pain management approaches that could reduce chronic pain, thereby improving patient quality of life and functional recovery.
