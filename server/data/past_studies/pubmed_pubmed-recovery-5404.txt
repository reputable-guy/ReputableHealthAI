Study Title: Deciphering bone marrow engraftment after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in humans using single-cell analyses.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUNDDonor cell engraftment is a prerequisite of successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Based on peripheral blood analyses, it is characterized by early myeloid recovery and T and B cell lymphopenia. However, cellular networks associated with bone marrow engraftment of allogeneic human cells have been poorly described.METHODSMass cytometry and CITE-Seq analyses were performed on bone marrow cells 3 months after transplantation in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.RESULTSMass cytometric analyses in 26 patients and 20 healthy controls disclosed profound alterations in myeloid and B cell progenitors, with a shift toward terminal myeloid differentiation and decreased B cell progenitors. Unsupervised analysis separated recipients into 2 groups, one of them being driven by previous graft-versus-host disease (R2 patients). We then used single-cell CITE-Seq to decipher engraftment, which resolved 36 clusters, encompassing all bone marrow cellular components. Hematopoiesis in transplant recipients was sustained by committed myeloid and erythroid progenitors in a setting of monocyte-, NK cell-, and T cell-mediated inflammation. Gene expression revealed major pathways in transplant recipients, namely, TNF-&#x3b1; signaling via NF-&#x3ba;B and the IFN-&#x3b3; response. The hallmark of allograft rejection was consistently found in clusters from transplant recipients, especially in R2 recipients.CONCLUSIONBone marrow cell engraftment of allogeneic donor cells is characterized by a state of emergency hematopoiesis in the setting of an allogeneic response driving inflammation.FUNDINGThis study was supported by the French National Cancer Institute (Institut National du Cancer; PLBIO19-239) and by an unrestricted research grant by Alexion Pharmaceuticals.
