Study Title: Effect of cognitive reserve on the association between slow wave sleep and cognition in community-dwelling older adults.

Study Summary:
Sleep, especially slow wave sleep (SWS), is essential for cognitive functioning and is reduced in aging. The impact of sleep quality on cognition is variable, especially in aging. Cognitive reserve (CR) may be an important modulator of these effects. We aimed at investigating this question to better identify individuals in whom sleep disturbances might have greater behavioral consequences. Polysomnography and neuropsychological assessments were performed in 135 cognitively intact older adults (mean age &#xb1; SD: 69.4 &#xb1; 3.8y) from the Age-Well randomized controlled trial (baseline data). Two measures of cognitive engagement throughout life were used as CR proxies. Linear regression analyses were performed between the proportion of SWS, and executive function and episodic memory composite scores. Then, interaction analyses between SWS and CR proxies on cognition were conducted to assess the possible impact of CR on these links. SWS was positively associated with episodic memory, but not with executive function. CR proxies modulated the associations between SWS and both executive and episodic memory performance. Specifically, individuals with higher CR were able to maintain cognitive performance despite low amounts of SWS. This study provides the first evidence that CR may protect against the deleterious effects of age-related sleep changes on cognition.
