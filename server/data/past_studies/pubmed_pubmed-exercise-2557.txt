Study Title: Efficacy and safety of step-by-step Baduanjin exercise based on doctor-nurse-patient integration mode for pulmonary rehabilitation in patients after lobectomy due to pulmonary tuberculosis: a randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Some pulmonary tuberculosis patients may require lung resection surgery. Postoperative pulmonary rehabilitation is essential to restore the lung function and maintain quality of life. We aimed to study the pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes and complications of step-by-step Baduanjin exercise under a doctor-nurse-patient integration mode in patients after lobectomy due to pulmonary tuberculosis. We performed a randomized controlled clinical trial in patients undergoing lobectomy due to pulmonary tuberculosis between September 2017 and August 2021. Eligible patients were randomly assigned into the control group or interventional group. The control group received routine postoperative care. The interventional group received step-by-step Baduanjin exercise based on the doctor-nurse-patient integration mode in addition to the routine care. The primary outcomes were the pulmonary functions, including forced expiratory volume in 1&#xa0;s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC. The secondary outcomes were the maximum walking distance in a 6-min walk test and postoperative pulmonary complications, including atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. A total of 100 patients were enrolled into the study, with 50 patients in the control and interventional groups. There were 60 female patients (60%). The mean patient age was 37.9 (&#xb1;&#x2009;2.8) years old. At the one- and two-month postoperative follow-ups, pulmonary function tests showed statistically significantly better performances in FEV1/prediction, FVC/prediction, and FEV1/FVC in the interventional group than the control group. The 6-min walk test also revealed longer walking distances in the interventional group than the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative complications between the two groups. A step-by-step Baduanjin exercise regimen under the doctor-nurse-patient integration mode could safely improve pulmonary rehabilitation in patients after lobectomy due to pulmonary tuberculosis.
