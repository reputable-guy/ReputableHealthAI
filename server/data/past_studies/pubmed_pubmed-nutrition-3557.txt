Study Title: Enhanced serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, interleukin-1&#x3b2;, and -6 in sarcopenia: alleviation through exercise and nutrition intervention.

Study Summary:
Limited research has been conducted on the post-intervention inflammatory status in sarcopenic patients, despite previous studies revealing elevated pro-inflammatory markers. This study aimed to investigate the potential elevation of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines in sarcopenic patients and evaluate the effects of exercise and nutritional support interventions on these cytokine levels. In this post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 57 individuals with sarcopenia from the RCT and 57 non-sarcopenic participants from the same geriatric community cohort that did not participate in the RCT were enrolled. Grip strength and body composition measurements were recorded. Tumor necrotizing factor (TNF)-&#x3b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, and IL-15 levels were assessed at baseline for both groups and after a 12-week intervention consisting of resistive exercise and supplementation with branched-chain amino acids, calcium, and vitamin D3 in the patients with sarcopenia. The sarcopenic group demonstrated significantly lower body weight, body mass index, grip strength, and skeletal muscle mass index. Moreover, sarcopenic patients exhibited higher levels of TNF-&#x3b1; (=0.007), IL-1&#x3b2; (<0.001), and IL-6 (<0.001), while no significant difference was observed in IL-15 (=0.345) between participants with and those without sarcopenia. Following the intervention, the sarcopenic group experienced significant improvements in grip strength and skeletal muscle mass index with a notable reduction in TNF-&#x3b1; (=0.003), IL-1&#x3b2; (=0.012) and IL-6 (=0.001) levels. Sarcopenic patients exhibit elevated levels of TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, and IL-6, which declined after nutrition support and exercise interventions. However, further research is necessary to evaluate the long-term impact of these interventions on cytokine levels.
