Study Title: Effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting.

Study Summary:
Considering the importance of cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and the development of acupuncture over the past few decades, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on patients' exercise tolerance, heart rate and blood pressure after CABG. Thirty-four patients with a history of recent CABG were recruited between 2019 and 2020 for this clinical trial and randomly divided into two groups receiving acupuncture plus cardiac rehabilitation (group A) and cardiac rehabilitation alone (group B). In both groups, exercise-based rehabilitation exercise was performed. Group A additionally received acupuncture at PC6, PC4, HT7 and GB20 bilaterally. Changes in blood pressure, heart rate and Borg scale score were evaluated before, during and after the course of the treatment. Heart rate was significantly lower in group A compared to group B after completion of the course of the treatment (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or Borg scale scores (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Nevertheless, the Borg scale scores showed a significant decrease within each group over time (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), reflecting an improvement in the patients' ability to tolerate activity after cardiac rehabilitation with or without acupuncture. Acupuncture in combination with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation was more effective at decreasing heart rate than cardiac rehabilitation alone after CABG. Both approaches appeared to be similarly effective at improving exercise tolerance. In this study, the addition of acupuncture at the aforementioned traditional acupuncture point locations to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation did not affect blood pressure.
