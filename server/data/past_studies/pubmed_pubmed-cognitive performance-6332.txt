Study Title: The Matrix Matters: Beverage Carbonation Impacts the Timing of Caffeine Effects on Sustained Attention.

Study Summary:
Both caffeine and the perception of refreshment delivered by cooling, tingling, and mouth-watering flavors have individually been shown to positively impact cognitive performance and mood, though presently there is limited evidence on their possible combined effects. This study explored the contribution of refreshing compounds in beverages, namely, carbon dioxide and citric acid, on the acute effects of caffeine on sustained attention and self-rated physical and mental energy. A randomized, controlled crossover trial was conducted by testing three products: a carbonated caffeinated beverage; a comparator caffeinated beverage; and a flavor-matched control beverage. Findings from 24 healthy adults revealed product-dependent variations in cognitive performance during a 60-min visual sustained-attention task, suggesting that the carbonated-caffeinated beverage led to faster, greater and more consistent levels of accuracy, compared to the control beverage. Specifically, significant differences were found between: (1) the carbonated-caffeinated beverage and the caffeinated beverage, and (2) between the caffeinated beverage and the control beverage for number of hits, reaction time and false alarm scores. Both caffeinated beverages led to higher physical and mental energy, and lower physical and mental fatigue 60-min post-consumption. These findings suggest beneficial effects on sustained attention through the combination of caffeine with refreshing compounds.
