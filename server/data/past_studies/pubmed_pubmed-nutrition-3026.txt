Study Title: Effect of multidisciplinary medical nutrition therapy on the nutrition status of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition is a prevalent complication in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). This study established a multidisciplinary team for medical nutrition therapy (MNT) to investigate the impact of this approach on enhancing the nutrition, anemic, and microinflammatory status of patients receiving PD. This randomized controlled trial study involved 81 patients undergoing PD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41 in the intervention group, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40 in the control group). The intervention group received comprehensive MNT management, whereas the control group received standard nutrition care. The intervention spanned a 6-month period. Various nutrition parameters, markers of anemia, and microinflammatory indexes were assessed before the intervention, at 3 months, and at 6 months postintervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and the nonparametric Scheirer-Ray-Hare test were used for within-group and between-group comparisons. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of age, sex, duration of dialysis, primary disease, or baseline prenutrition inflammation data. At 6 months postintervention, the intervention group exhibited higher levels of serum albumin, blood calcium, serum iron, hemoglobin, total iron-binding capacity, body mass index, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, handgrip strength, and daily energy and protein intake compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated lower levels of subjective nutrition assessment value, C-reactive protein, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio than the control group (P < 0.05), with no statistically significant differences in other markers after interventions. Multidisciplinary MNT can ameliorate the nutrition status of patients receiving PD, decrease the incidence of malnutrition, and improve anemia and microinflammatory outcomes.
