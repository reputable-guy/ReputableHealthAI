Study Title: Unilateral high-load resistance training induced a similar cross-education of strength between the dominant and non-dominant arm.

Study Summary:
It was previously hypothesized that the cross-education of strength is asymmetrical, where a greater transfer of strength is observed from the dominant to the non-dominant limb. The purpose of this study was to examine if the magnitude of cross-education of strength differed between dominant and non-dominant limbs following unilateral high-load resistance training. One hundred and twenty-two participants were randomized to one of the three groups: 1) training on the dominant arm (D-Only), 2) training on the non-dominant arm (ND-Only) and 3) a time-matched non-exercise control (Control). The training groups completed 6&#x2009;weeks (18 sessions) of unilateral elbow flexion exercise. Each training session started with one-repetition maximum (1RM) training (&#x2264; five attempts), followed by four sets of high-load exercise (i.e. 8-12RM). Strength changes of the untrained arm were compared between groups. Changes in the strength of the untrained arm were greater in D-Only (1.5&#x2009;kg) and ND-Only (1.3&#x2009;kg) compared to Control (-0.2&#x2009;kg), without differences between D-Only and ND-Only. Unilateral resistance training increased strength in the opposite untrained arm, and the magnitude of this effect was similar regardless of which arm was trained. However, there is still considerable uncertainty on this topic and additional research is warranted to confirm the current findings.
