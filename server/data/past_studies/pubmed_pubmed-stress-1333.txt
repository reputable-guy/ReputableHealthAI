Study Title: Application of placing the anterior end of endotracheal tube at the glottis in laryngeal mask airway positive ventilation during general anesthesia: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Glottic contraction and closure causes ventilation obstruction and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) leakage during positive pressure ventilation using LMA. This study aimed to assess the effect of placing the anterior end of the endotracheal tube (ET) at the glottis through the LMA ventilation conduit on treating LMA leakage following glottic contraction and closure. In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, patients with non-minor surgery using LMA ventilation were randomly allocated to the i-gel group (group L) and the i-gel combined with ET group (group LE). The tip of ET was placed 2&#x2009;cm under glottis guided by fiberoptic bronchoscope through i-gel ventilation conduit in group LE. The perioperative incidence of i-gel leakage, the changes of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) following artificial airway insertion, and adverse events were recorded. Perioperative i-gel leakage was observed in 7 of 48 patients (14.6%) in group L and 1 of 49 patients (2.0%) in group LE. There was significant difference in the incidence of leakage between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.031). SBP and HR after ET insertion in group LE increased significantly compared to those in group L (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05/5). The values of both SBP and HR after ET insertion did not exceed the basic values in group LE (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05/4). There were no significant differences in the incidence and severity of postoperative sore pain and hoarseness, cough during i-gel and ET removal between the 2 groups (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). Placing the anterior end of ET at the glottis reduced LMA air leakage related to glottic contraction and closure in non-minor surgery. The ET placing had low stress response and did not significantly increase postoperative complications.
