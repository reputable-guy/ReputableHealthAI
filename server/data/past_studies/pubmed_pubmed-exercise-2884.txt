Study Title: Early postoperative water exposure does not increase complications in cutaneous surgeries: A randomized, investigator-blinded, controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Patients are often advised to keep the initial postoperative dressings dry and undisturbed for 24 to 72 hours. However, these requirements may result in significant disruption of patients' activities of daily living, such as bathing, leisure, and exercise. Compare standard management of keeping wounds dry and covered (48 hours) with early (6 hours) postoperative water exposure. Investigator-blinded, randomized (1:1), controlled trial evaluating rate of infection and additional outcomes of interest. Overall, 437 patients were randomized to either the early (6-hour) water exposure (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;218) intervention group or the standard cohort (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;219). The incidence of culture-proven infection in the intervention group (1.8%) was similar to the standard group (1.4%) (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;.99). There was also no difference in rates of bleeding or bruising. Scar assessment using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale revealed similar scar outcomes. Single site, academic center. Surgical wounds can be allowed to get wet in the immediate postoperative period with no increased incidence of infection or other complications and with similar cosmesis.
