Study Title: A randomised study to evaluate the potential added value of shared meditation involving people with cancer, health&#xa0;professionals and third persons compared to meditation conducted with patients only: design of the Implic-2&#xa0;protocol.

Study Summary:
In oncology, the suffering of patients and the burnout of health professionals are key issues. Mindfulness meditation is a holistic approach that can help to improve well-being. While numerous studies have shown the benefits of meditation for both patients and health professionals, the added value of offering shared meditation to groups of patients, health professionals and third persons has not been assessed. Beyond strengthening the relationship between carers and patients, opening up meditation sessions to third parties (neither carers nor patients) enables patients to escape the stigma of their illness. We previously conducted a pilot study that validated the feasibility and the relevance of shared meditation with a specifically designed programme. IMPLIC-2 is a two-arm randomised study designed to assess the added value of this meditation programme (optimised following the pilot study), particularly for cancer patients (our target population). People motivated to follow the programme, without previous regular practice of meditation and able to participate in the sessions are eligible. The study will include 96 participants: 16 health professionals, 16 third persons and 64 patients. The latter will be randomized in two arms: the experimental arm ("Shared" meditation) consisting of 4 mixed groups of 8 patients, 4 health professionals and 4 third parties, and the control arm ("Patient" meditation) consisting of 2 groups of 16 patients. Validated questionnaires will be used to measure the effects of the programme, notably in terms of quality of life, perceived stress, feelings of self-efficacy, qualities of mindfulness and self-compassion, and carers' burn-out. Participants' perception of a change in their quality of life and satisfaction will be measured at the end of the programme. A complementary qualitative focus-group approach will be used to optimise implementation of the programme beyond the study. The well-being of oncology patients would be improved. Dealing with overworked carers would have a beneficial impact on the way they interact with patients. In addition, encounters between the three types of population will allow otherness to be viewed differently and alleviate suffering by promoting collective humanity.
