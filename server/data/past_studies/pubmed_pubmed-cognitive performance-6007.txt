Study Title: Brain endurance training improves sedentary older adults' cognitive and physical performance when fresh and fatigued.

Study Summary:
Cognitive and physical performance is impaired by aging and fatigue. Cognitive and exercise training may mitigate such impairments. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of Brain Endurance Training (BET) - combined cognitive and exercise training - on cognitive and physical performance when fresh and fatigued in older adults. Twenty-four healthy sedentary women (65-78 years) were randomly allocated to one of three training groups: BET, exercise training, and control (no training). The BET and exercise training groups completed the same physical training protocol comprising three 45-min exercise sessions (20-min resistance exercise plus 25-min endurance exercise) per week for eight weeks. The BET group completed a 20-min cognitive task prior to exercise tasks. Cognitive (tasks: psychomotor vigilance, Stroop) and physical (tests: walk, chair-stand, arm curl) performance was tested when fresh and fatigued (before and after a 30-min cognitive task) at weeks 0 (pre-test), 4 (mid-test), 8 (post-test), and 12 (follow-up test). Cognitive and physical and performance was generally superior when fresh and fatigued at mid-test and post-test for both BET and exercise training groups compared to the control group. The BET group outperformed the exercise group when fatigued at mid-test and post-test both cognitively (always) and physically (sometimes). The pre-to-post changes in cognitive performance when fresh and fatigued averaged 3.7&#xa0;% and 7.8&#xa0;% for BET, 3.6&#xa0;% and 4.5&#xa0;% for exercise, and -0.4&#xa0;% and 0.3&#xa0;% for control groups. The corresponding changes in physical performance averaged 16.5&#xa0;% and 29.9&#xa0;% for BET, 13.8&#xa0;% and 22.4&#xa0;% for exercise, and 10.8&#xa0;% and 7.1&#xa0;% for control groups. These findings show that BET can improve cognitive and physical performance in older adults.
