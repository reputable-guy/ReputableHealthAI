Study Title: Effects of Nutrition Education Program for the Japan Diet on Serum Phospholipid Fatty Acid Compositions in Patients with Dyslipidemia: Re-analysis of Data from a Previous Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
We investigated changes in serum phospholipid fatty acid compositions with intake of the Japan Diet (JD) (higher consumption of fish, soybeans, vegetables, seaweed/mushrooms/konjak, and unrefined cereals with reduced consumption of animal fat, meat and poultry with fat, sweets and alcoholic drinks) recommended by the Japan Atherosclerosis Society. A randomized parallel controlled clinical trial on JD intake was conducted on Japanese patients with dyslipidemia. Nutrition education, based on the JD or partial JD (PJD) at baseline and at 3 months, was provided and the participants were followed up for 6 months. Fatty acids comprising serum phospholipids were measured in the JD (n=44) and PJD (n=44) groups. Fatty acid intakes of C20:4, C20:5 and C22:6 increased in the JD group as compared with the PJD group. The percentages of serum phospholipid, C22:1 and C20:5 increased, while those of C18:1, C20:3(n-6) and C20:4(n-6) decreased in the JD as compared with the PJD group at 3 months. Changes in the phospholipid concentrations of C20:5, C22:5 and C22:6 reflected those intake volumes. Serum phospholipid C20:5 and C22:6 showed inverse correlations with C18:1, C18:2, and C20:3(n-6) at baseline and the changes at 3 and 6 months. In contrast, no correlation was observed between C20:4(n-6) and those n-3 fatty acids. The ratios of fatty acid concentrations, C16:1/C16:0 and C18:1/C18:0, decreased, but the ratio of C20:4(n-6)/C20:3(n-6) increased in the JD group. Nutrition education on the JD changed serum phospholipid fatty acid profiles in favor to prevent against cardiovascular risk factors in patients with dyslipidemia.
