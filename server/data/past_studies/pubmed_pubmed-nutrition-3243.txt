Study Title: Culinary Comfort: Understanding the Connection between Food and Well-Being.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the complex interaction between individuals' culinary tastes, at-home dining habits, and their broader impact on general well-being and relationships dynamics. An all-encompassing tool for assessing the impact of dietary choices on emotions related to coziness, social interaction, and general wellness, the multidimensional Culinary Comfort and Connection Index (CCCI) focuses on traditional home-cooked meals, in particular. We used an online-based survey to validate the CCCI. With a Cronbach alpha of 0.844, this scale is reliable and valid. It covers a wide range of aspects including self-care advocacy, traditional values, and a preference for handmade food. We performed descriptive and stratified analyses and tested correlations. The CCCI shows complicated patterns when analyzed with respect to gender, education level, and family income that demonstrate a myriad of factors impacting people's views on food and its relationship to health. While some patterns emerged, the results imply that dietary choices do not necessarily correlate with overall health. The research highlights the complex interaction between cultural, societal, and personal elements in determining perspectives on nutrition and health by drawing on theoretical models like Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior. Future research should incorporate broader age ranges, longitudinal designs, different populations, objective measurements, and intervention trials to better understand the dynamic link between dietary preferences and health outcomes.
