Study Title: A Qualitative Study Exploring Feasibility and Acceptability of Acupuncture, Yoga, and Mindfulness Meditation for Managing Weight After Breast Cancer.

Study Summary:
Weight gain is common after breast cancer. Yoga, mindfulness meditation, and acupuncture may assist with managing weight. However, evidence on effectiveness is limited. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting for and implementing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating these interventions as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise) for weight management in women with breast cancer. Qualitative study involving virtual focus groups or semi-structured interviews. Participants were recruited via email invitation from a breast cancer consumer organization and breast cancer center in Australia. Eligible participants had received treatment for breast cancer, and were fluent in English. A purposive sample of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) participants was also recruited. Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis with the constant comparison method. Emails were sent to 1415 women of which 37 provided data in 5 focus groups and 1 semi-structured interview, including 1 focus group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6) with only women from CALD backgrounds. Yoga and mindfulness meditation were perceived as feasible and acceptable for weight management, but acupuncture was seen to be too invasive to be acceptable. A focus on wellness rather than weight reduction, flexible program delivery, trusted advice, consideration of participant burden and benefit, and peer-support were key factors perceived to increase feasibility and acceptability. Yoga and mindfulness meditation are acceptable and useful adjuncts to lifestyle interventions for weight management after breast cancer. This research places end-users at the forefront of trial design, and will inform future trials using these interventions for weight management and improving health and wellbeing after breast cancer.
