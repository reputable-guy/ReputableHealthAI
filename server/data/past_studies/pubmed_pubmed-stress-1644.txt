Study Title: Ergonomic considerations for the modern radiology practice: An update.

Study Summary:
The average post-pandemic modern radiology practice is experiencing an ever-increasing workload volume with overall relatively similar staffing levels, regardless of practice setting. This has resulted in an increased workload demand for the average diagnostic radiologist, which in many cases translates to longer working hours. It is now more important than ever to be cognizant of various work-related injuries, including repetitive-stress injuries and vision-related ailments as examples, in relation to the working conditions of the radiologist. This article will discuss commonly occurring conditions and ergonomic considerations that the radiologist can employ to reduce the risk of work-related injuries.
