Study Title: A randomised controlled school-based nutritional intervention in five Middle Eastern countries: Ajyal Salima improved students' dietary and physical activity habits.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of the Ajyal Salima school intervention on nutrition and physical activity outcomes in children aged 9&#x2013;11 years. The study was a 1-year cluster-randomised controlled trial. Ajyal Salima used a multi-component approach including classroom activities, family programme and food service adaptation. Outcomes included daily intake of breakfast, frequency of healthy and unhealthy food consumption, frequency of physical activity, knowledge score and self-efficacy score. Intervention and control groups were compared for all main outcomes and a post-intervention qualitative evaluation assessed strengths and limitations of the intervention components. Schools in five countries &#x2013; Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Schools were selected by Ministries of Health and Education within their jurisdictions. Forty-five intervention schools (6052 students) and forty-six control schools (6200 students) were included in the analysis. The intervention group had a significantly higher odds of consuming breakfast daily (OR 95 % CI = 1&#xb7;60, 1&#xb7;35, 1&#xb7;90), consuming healthy foods (OR 95 % CI = 1&#xb7;60, 1&#xb7;39, 1&#xb7;84) and a decreased odds of consuming unhealthy foods and sweetened beverages (OR, 95 % CI = 0&#xb7;70, 0&#xb7;60, 0&#xb7;81). Additionally, school children in the intervention group, as compared with the control group, were 47 % more likely to exercise outside school hours (OR 95 % CI = 1&#xb7;47, 1&#xb7;23, 1&#xb7;76). Lastly, children in the intervention group had a significantly improved nutritional knowledge score and improved self-efficacy by 1&#xb7;3 score unit and 1&#xb7;1 score unit, respectively. The Ajyal Salima intervention led to significant improvements in dietary and physical activity habits among school children and increased nutritional knowledge scores.
