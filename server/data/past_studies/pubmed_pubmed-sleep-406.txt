Study Title: Mandibular movement monitor provides faster, yet accurate diagnosis for obstructive sleep apnoea: A randomised controlled study.

Study Summary:
Many patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) remain undiagnosed and thus untreated, and in part this relates to delay in diagnosis. Novel diagnostic strategies may improve access to diagnosis. In a multicentre, randomised study, we evaluated time to treatment decision in patients referred for suspected OSA, comparing a mandibular movement (MM) monitor to respiratory polygraphy, the most commonly used OSA detection method in the UK. Adults with high pre-test probability OSA were recruited from both northern Scotland and London. 40 participants (70&#x202f;% male, mean&#xb1;SD age 46.8 &#xb1; 12.9 years, BMI 36.9 &#xb1; 7.5 kg/m, ESS 14.9 &#xb1; 4.1) wore a MM monitor and respiratory polygraphy simultaneously overnight and were randomised (1:1) to receive their treatment decision based on results from either device. Compared to respiratory polygraphy, MM monitor reduced time to treatment decision by 6 days (median(IQR): 13.5 (7.0-21.5) vs. 19.5 (13.7-35.5) days, P = 0.017) and saved an estimated 29 min of staff time per patient.
