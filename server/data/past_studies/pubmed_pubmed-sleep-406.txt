Study Title: Effects of hormone replacement therapy on mood and sleep quality in menopausal women.

Study Summary:
Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment strategy for the management of symptoms in naturally menopausal women. However, some patients report experiencing adverse effects. To analyze the effects of hormone replacement therapy in menopausal female patients. A total of 152 menopausal female patients admitted to the Gynecology Department of the Ganzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital between January 2021 and December 2023 were divided into the observation group (= 76, conventional treatment + hormone replacement therapy) and the control group (= 76, conventional treatment only)random casting. The improvement observed in the following items were compared between the groups: Kupperman menopausal index (KMI), emotional state [The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)], sleep quality [Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS)], treatment effectiveness, and treatment safety. The modified KMI and SRSS scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group after three rounds of treatment. The improvement in the PANAS score observed in the observation group was greater than that observed in the control group (< 0.05). The total treatment effectivity rate in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (86.84%96.05%,= 4.121,= 0.042). The incidence rate of adverse reactions in the two groups was comparable (6.58%9.21%,= 0.361,= 0.547). Hormone replacement therapy effectively improved the clinical symptoms, actively channeled negative emotions, and improved the quality of sleep in menopausal patients, indicating its effectiveness and safety.
