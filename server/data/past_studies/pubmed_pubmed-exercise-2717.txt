Study Title: Effects of different exercise interventions on cardiopulmonary function in male tobacco-dependent college students.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the effects of different exercise interventions on cardiopulmonary function in male tobacco-dependent college students. Forty-five male tobacco-dependent college students were recruited as the tobacco-dependent (TB) group, and 45 non-tobacco-dependent college students were recruited as the control group. The TB group was randomly assigned to three subgroups: non-exercise (NE), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). The HIIT and MICT groups underwent a 10-week exercise training, while the NE group received no intervention. Cardiac parameters, including maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), heart rate max (HRmax), and heart rate reserve (HRR), and pulmonary indicators, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), vital capacity (VC), maximum ventilation volume (MVV), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were investigated. The results showed that the TB group had significantly lower cardiopulmonary function than the control group. The degree of tobacco dependence was negatively correlated with VO2max, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and MVV. Furthermore, both HIIT and MICT training improved cardiopulmonary function. HIIT training exhibited superior efficacy compared to MICT in improving HRmax, HRR, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and PEF. In conclusion, tobacco dependence adversely affects cardiopulmonary function in male college students. Both HIIT and MICT effectively improved cardiopulmonary function, with HIIT showing superior efficacy.
