Study Title: Transcending Limitations: A Phenomenological Exploration of How Hygge Practices Enrich the Lived Experiences of Adults with Cystic Fibrosis.

Study Summary:
Hygge practices embody joy, peace, mindfulness, coziness, and conviviality. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive condition with complex therapies and physical limitations. Little is known about how hygge practice may impact individuals living with CF. A qualitative study explored how adults with CF use hygge practices to promote wellness and cope with their disease. A purposive network sample of 15 adults with CF who utilized hygge practices completed semistructured audio-recorded telephone interviews. Recordings were transcribed and analyzed using Colaizzi's thematic analysis approach. Results reveal that hygge practices influenced individuals' aesthetics, attitudes, and activities, deeply impacting the physical and emotional experience of living with CF. Incorporating hygge into CF care may improve psychological well-being and quality of life for members of this community.
