Study Title: The Effects of a Novel Sodium Bicarbonate Ingestion System on Repeated 4&#xa0;km Cycling Time Trial Performance in Well-Trained Male Cyclists.

Study Summary:
A novel sodium bicarbonate (SB) product has come to market named the "Bicarb System" (M-SB; Maurten AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). It claims to minimise gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort whilst still improving exercise performance. To investigate the effects of M-SB ingestion on repeated 4&#xa0;km cycling time trials (TT1 and TT2) in well-trained male cyclists. The study recruited ten well-trained cyclists (maximal oxygen uptake (): 67&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4&#xa0;ml&#xa0;kg&#xa0;minBM; peak power output (PPO) at: 423&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;21 W) to take part in this randomised, crossover and double-blinded study. Following one visit to determine, participants completed a second visit to identify individual time to peak blood bicarbonate (HCO) (ITTP) in a rested state. Visit three was a familiarisation trial mimicking the experimental procedures. Visits four to seven consisted of completing 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;4&#xa0;km cycling TTs separated by 45&#xa0;min passive recovery, following one of either: 0.3&#xa0;g&#xa0;kgBM M-SB, 0.21&#xa0;g&#xa0;kgBM sodium chloride (placebo; PLA) in vegetarian capsules (size 00), or a control trial (CON). Supplements (M-SB or placebo) were ingested pre-exercise at their respective ITTP. Performance in TT1 was faster in the M-SB condition compared with TT1 in CON (-&#x2009;5.1&#xa0;s; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) and PLA (-&#x2009;3.5&#xa0;s; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). In TT2, performance was also significantly faster in the M-SB condition compared with CON (-&#x2009;4.4&#xa0;s; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018) or PLA (-&#x2009;4.1&#xa0;s; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). Total aggregated GI symptoms were generally low and not significantly different between PLA and the M-SB conditions for a range of symptoms. The ingestion of M-SB improves repeated 4&#xa0;km cycling TT performance and the recovery of acid-base balance&#xa0;between bouts, whilst causing minimal GI discomfort.
