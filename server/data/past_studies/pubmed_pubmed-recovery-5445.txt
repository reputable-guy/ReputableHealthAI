Study Title: Cryo-Pneumatic Compression Results in a Significant Decrease in Opioid Consumption After Shoulder Surgery: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The management of pain after shoulder surgery typically includes the use of cryotherapy and the prescription of opioid analgesics. Much focus has been placed lately on the opioid epidemic, which in part is fueled by excessive prescription of opioid medication. Previous studies have found a combination of cryotherapy and compression effective at reducing analgesic consumption and increasing recovery in patients undergoing knee and spine surgery; however, efficacy in patients undergoing shoulder surgery has not been evaluated. To evaluate the effectiveness of a cryo-pneumatic compression device on postoperative shoulder pain, narcotic use, and quality of life when compared with standard care cryotherapy. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. In total, 200 patients older than 18 years scheduled for unilateral shoulder surgery were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either postoperative cryo-pneumatic compression or standard care. The intervention group received a cryo-pneumatic device, while the standard care group received the treating surgeon's preferred method of postoperative care, including standard cryotherapy. Narcotic use was evaluated by the number of oral morphine milligram equivalents consumed during the postoperative period, as well as the time to cessation of narcotic use. Patient-reported outcome measures consisted of a numeric rating scale pain score, 36-item Short Form Survey, patient experience assessed using the net promoter score, and adverse events. Outcomes were evaluated at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Patients receiving cryo-pneumatic compression reported a significant decrease in opioid consumption when compared with standard care (oral morphine milligram equivalents median, 56.1 vs 112;= .02468). A significant increase in self-reported function was seen in the cryo-pneumatic compression group at 2 weeks when compared with standard care (mean, 61.2 vs 54.2;= .0412). In patients undergoing unilateral shoulder surgery, the use of cryotherapy with pneumatic compression, when compared with standard care, resulted in significantly decreased opioid consumption as well as increased function at 2 weeks.
