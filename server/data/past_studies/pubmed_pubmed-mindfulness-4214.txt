Study Title: The effect of 20-minute mindful breathing exercise on psychological well-being in epilepsy: A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Depression and anxiety are prevalent in epilepsy patients, but psychiatric or psychological services may not be accessible to all patients. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the 20-minute mindful breathing on the psychological well-being of PWE using an instructional video. This was a pilot, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The intervention group received a guided video and was briefed to perform the exercise twice a week for two weeks while the waitlist control group only received the video upon completion of the study. The subjects were assessed at three-time points (T0: Baseline, T1: 2&#xa0;weeks after the intervention, T2: 4&#xa0;weeks after intervention), using the Neurological Disorders Depression Index (NDDI-E), General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) and Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Twenty patients were recruited, with 10 in the intervention and waitlist-control groups. Compared with the waitlist-control group, participants in the intervention group showed significant improvement in NDDI-E at T1 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022) but not at T2 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.056) and greater improvement in GAD-7 at T1 and T2 but not statistically significant. The QOLIE-31 overall score in the intervention group has significantly improved at T1 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036) and T2 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.031) compared to the waitlist-control group. For MAAS, the intervention group also had an increased score at T2 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025). The 20-minute mindfulness breathing exercise has an immediate effect in improving depression and quality of life among people with epilepsy.
