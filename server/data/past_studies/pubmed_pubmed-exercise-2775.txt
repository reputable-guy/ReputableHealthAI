Study Title: Relationship between NT-proBNP, echocardiographic abnormalities and functional status in patients with subclinical siabetic cardiomyopathy.

Study Summary:
Persons with diabetes are at risk for developing a cardiomyopathy through several pathophysiological mechanisms independent of traditional risk factors for heart failure. Among those with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM), the relationship between natriuretic peptides, cardiac structural abnormalities and functional capacity is largely unknown. In this prespecified subgroup analysis of the Aldose Reductase Inhibition for Stabilization of Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure (ARISE-HF) trial, 685 participants with asymptomatic DbCM underwent baseline echocardiography data, laboratory investigations, and functional assessments. Participants were stratified by N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) quartiles, and correlation with echocardiographic and functional parameters were assessed using Spearman correlation test. The median NT-proBNP was 71 (Q1, Q3: 33, 135) ng/L. No association was observed between NT-proBNP concentrations and echocardiographic parameters of either diastolic or systolic dysfunction including global longitudinal strain, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, left atrial volume index, E/E', or right ventricular systolic pressure. In contrast, NT-proBNP was significantly correlated with overall Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (rho = -&#x2009;0.10; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007), the Physical Activity Scale in the Elderly (rho = -&#x2009;0.12; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), duration of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (rho = -&#x2009;0.28; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), peak VO(rho = -&#x2009;0.26; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and ratio of minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production (rho&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). After adjustment for known confounders, the correlation with Physical Activity Scale in the Elderly and overall Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score was no longer significant. Among patients with subclinical DbCM, elevated NT-proBNP concentrations are associated with worse health status, lower activity levels, and reduced functional capacity, but not with cardiac structural abnormalities. These findings suggest that regardless of cardiac structural abnormalities, biomarker concentrations reflect important deterioration in functional capacity in affected individuals.
