Study Title: Feasibility of intranasal human milk as stem cell therapy in preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage.

Study Summary:
Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common cause of preterm brain injury. Fresh parent's own milk (POM) contains pluripotent stem cells (SCs) that produce neuronal cells in-vitro. The permeable neonatal blood brain barrier potentially allows SC delivery. We performed the first prospective trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04225286) of feasibility of intranasal POM (IPOM) in preterm infants with IVH and described SC content of POM samples. 37 Infants (mean gestation 27.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.6 weeks, birthweight 1030&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;320&#x2009;g) with IVH (35.1% grade IV) were recruited from two tertiary Toronto NICUs. IPOM was given ideally twice daily until 28 days of age. Tolerance and adverse reactions were collected and 162 administering providers surveyed. There were no major adverse reactions. Provider surveys suggested acceptability, although potential provider and subject stress requires further study. Milk cell analysis suggests wide variability between parents. This phase 1 study demonstrated IPOM was tolerated and feasible in preterm infants.
