Study Title: The effect of a mindfulness intervention (MI) on sleep disturbance (SD) among nurses.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbance (SD) makes it difficult for nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) to perform activities that require focused and continual concentration, which raises the risk of medical errors, health issues, loss of sleep, and patient care mistakes. The mindfulness intervention (MI) was created to give participants the capacity to approach their own emotions with non-judgmental awareness and to become more conscious of their thoughts and feelings, and it reduced psychological symptoms. This study examined the effect of MI on SD among nurses. A randomized control trail (RCT) was conducted and recruited 100 nurses from intensive care and medical-surgical units from three hospitals located at the northern and middle regions of Jordan. Bivariate analysis including independent T-test and multiple linear regressions were used to study the differences between the interventional group (MI) and the comparison group (watching mindfulness videos) in terms of the impact on the SD. Nurses reported significant and high levels of SD. MI significantly reduced the level of SD and improved sleep quality among nurses. MI should be integrated into nursing competences to combat the negative impacts of poor sleep quality on nurses and organizational-sensitive outcomes.
