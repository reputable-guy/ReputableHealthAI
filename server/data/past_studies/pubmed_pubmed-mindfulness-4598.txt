Study Title: A Randomized, Controlled Pilot Study of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction in Healthy Older Adults.

Study Summary:
As the aging population increases, it is critical to find ways to sustain older adults' health and well-being. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may be one approach, but its effects are difficult to discern because few studies have conducted randomized controlled trials with an active control group and blinded examiners. We begin to address these gaps with a pilot study examining the feasibility of conducting an MBSR intervention with an active control condition in healthy older adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two classes, MBSR or Brain Health education. Classes were matched for time, format, and instructor. The study examined acceptability, practicality, implementation, and preliminary efficacy using a range of participant questionnaires, instructor ratings, cognitive measures assessed by blinded examiners, and attendance. Both MBSR and the Brain Health class evidenced high rates of recruitment, participant satisfaction, and retention. Implementation procedures were successful, and preliminary results revealed similar levels of efficacy across both classes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an MBSR intervention in healthy older adults. MBSR, with its focus on improving stress and self-awareness, has the potential to be an approach that can improve aging adults' health and coping skills.
