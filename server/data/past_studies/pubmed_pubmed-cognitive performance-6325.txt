Study Title: Omega-3 Supplementation for the Prevention of Cognitive Decline in Older Adults: Does It Depend on Homocysteine Levels?

Study Summary:
Recent evidence point towards an interaction between omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and plasma homocysteine (Hcy). This study tested the hypothesis that effects of red blood cell n-3 PUFA are modified according to baseline plasma Hcy in the large Mulit-domain Alzheimer Prevention Trial (MAPT) throughout the 3-years of treatment with an additional 2 years of observational follow-up. Experimental study. From the 1680 participants that were randomized in the four groups of the MAPT study (two of which received n-3 PUFA, the other two without n-3 PUFA), 782 were selected because they had baseline data on both Hcy and n-3 PUFA. Cognitive performance was measured with a broad set of cognitive tests including free and total recall of the cued selective reminding test, digit symbol substitution test, category naming test and Trail-making tests (TMT-A and B) and Clinical dementia rating scale. We found a significant association between TMT-A and red blood cell n-3 PUFA levels in participants with Hcy values &#x2264;16.8 &#xb5;Mol/L after adjustments at baseline (Estimate: -1.3, 95% CI: -2.3; -0.3, p=0.01). Additionally, participants with high Hcy values had a significant worsening after adjustments in TMT-B after a 5-year n-3 PUFA supplementation, compared to low levels of Hcy (Mean difference: 34.8, 95% CI: 7.8;61.7). This study shows that Hcy levels could modify the association between red blood cell n-3 PUFA and executive function. People with high Hcy may benefit less from a n-3 PUFA supplementation to prevent cognitive decline.
