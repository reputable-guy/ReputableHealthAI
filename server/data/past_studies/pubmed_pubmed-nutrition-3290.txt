Study Title: Effect of a diabetes-specific formula in non-diabetic inpatients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
In patients with acute stroke, the presence of hyperglycaemia has been associated with higher morbidity and less neurological recovery. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a diabetes specific enteral nutrition (EN) formula on glycaemia, comorbidities and mortality in patients admitted with a first episode of stroke who received complete EN. This was a prospective randomised controlled trial. Patients with acute stroke did not have diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and required nasogastric tube feeding. This study has been registered with code NCT03422900. The patients were randomised into two arms: an isocaloric isoprotein formula (control group (CG), 27 patients) vs a diabetes-specific formula (low glycaemic index carbohydrates, fibre (80% soluble) and higher lipid content) (experimental group (EG), 25 patients). Pre-EN blood glucose, hyperglycaemia during EN treatment, HbA1c, insulin use, oral route recovery, length of stay (LOS) and mortality at 30&#x2009;days were collected. The complications of enteral nutrition during admission were collected as well. 52 patients were included, 50% females, with an age of 77.44(11.48)&#x2009;years; 34 (65.4%) had ischaemic stroke, with a Rankin score of 0(0-2), and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 19 (15-22). In CG, there were more cases of hyperglycaemia on the 5th day post-NE (13(65%) vs7(35%), p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). CG showed an OR of 7.58(1.49-39.16) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) for the development of hyperglycaemia. There were no differences in LOS between groups (12(8.5)&#x2009;days vs 14(23)&#x2009;days, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.19) or in the death rate (10(37%) vs 10(40%), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.8), although differences were found in terms of oral route recovery (EG: 11(44%) patients vs CG: 5(18.5%) patients, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) (OR (EG): 5.53(1.25-24.47); p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). The use of a diabetes-specific enteral formula in non-diabetic patients admitted with acute stroke reduced the risk of developing hyperglycaemia and improved the rate of oral route recovery. Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT03422900.
