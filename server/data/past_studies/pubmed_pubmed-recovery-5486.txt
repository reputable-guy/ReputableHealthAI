Study Title: Effects of a Dietary Microalgae () Supplement on Stress, Well-Being, and Performance in Water Polo Players: A Clinical Case Series.

Study Summary:
A common tactic used by athletes to improve performance, lessen tiredness, and hasten recovery is dietary supplementation. We aimed to assess the role of a microalgae dietary liquid supplement additivated with Copper 22.5% NRV in water polo players' performance. Twenty male water polo players were split into two groups: ten (spirulina group) took a twice-daily nutritional supplement containing 15 mL of spirulina liquid extract (titrated in Phycocyanin 1 mg/mL) and additivated with Copper 22.5% NRV for eight weeks, and ten (the placebo group) did not take the supplement. Subjective evaluations were finished using the Athlete's Subjective Performance Scale (ASPS). Levels of the biomarker creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were also assessed. The spirulina group's mean total ASPS score increased significantly from baseline to follow-up and was significantly better than that of the placebo group (< 0.001). Conversely, ASPS ratings in the placebo group slightly decreased. A positive correlation between spirulina supplementation and less severe ASPS was found using correlation matrix analysis. However, there was a slight difference in CPK levels from the baseline to the follow-up in the spirulina group. A dietary supplement comprising spirulina and copper may help water polo players' subjective performance measurements by lowering muscular tension. Larger, randomized controlled trials are yet required.
