Study Title: Effect of chewing gum in reducing postoperative ileus after gastroduodenal perforation peritonitis surgery: A prospective randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Chewing gum reduces the duration of postoperative ileus and early recovery of bowel function following elective abdominal surgery. However, its role has not been studied in cases of gastroduodenal perforation peritonitis, prompting us to conduct this study. Patients were randomised into two groups, 39 patients received chewing gum (study group) and 43 patients were in the control group. Sensation of hunger, appearance of first bowel sound, and passages of flatus and faeces were significantly early in the study group; their hospital stay was also shorter. Chewing gum reduces the duration of postoperative ileus in cases of gastroduodenal perforation peritonitis.Registration number: IEC/2020-23/3359 dated 13 December 2020, Institutional Ethics Committee, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College, Jabalpur, India.
