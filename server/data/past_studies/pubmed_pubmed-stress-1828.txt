Study Title: Effect of Argentine tango sessions on total physical activity time in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatism: randomized, controlled, pilot study.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an Argentine Tango (AT) program on total physical activity (PA) time in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). Prospective randomized controlled pilot study with two parallel groups. Participants were randomized 1:1 to attend a 24-week AT program from baseline to month&#xa0;6 for the immediate tango group (ITG) and a 12-week AT program from month&#xa0;3 to month&#xa0;6 for the wait-list control group (WLCG). Total PA time was measured at baseline, month&#xa0;3, and month&#xa0;6 using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire-ONAPS and an accelerometer. Twenty-seven participants (15 RA and 12 SpA) were enrolled in the study. Thirteen participants in the WLCG and 14 in the ITG. At month&#xa0;3, there was no significant difference in the total PA time between the two groups. Longitudinal analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups regarding PA, sedentary, fatigue, anxiety, depression, balance, physical performance, pain, and stress. However, body appreciation improved significantly in the ITG compared with the WLCG. Both groups showed improved physical abilities at 6&#xa0;month, including improvements in the 6-min walk test and timed up and go test. The ITG also reported reduced pain at months 3 and 6, while the WLCG exhibited improved balance at month 6. Although the AT program did not significantly increase total PA time in patients with CIR, it positively impacted body appreciation and physical abilities suggesting its potential as a complementary therapy. Key Points &#x2022; Body appreciation significantly improved after a 24-week AT program, emphasizing the positive impact of dance on self-perception. &#x2022; Both groups exhibited improved physical abilities at month 6, indicating a positive influence on participants' overall mobility and functional capacity. &#x2022; The 24-week AT group reported reduced pain at months 3 and 6, and the 12-week AT group exhibited improved balance at month 6.
