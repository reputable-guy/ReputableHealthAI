Study Title: Testing the efficacy of INtegral Cognitive REMediation (INCREM) in major depressive disorder: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Given the limitation of pharmacological treatments to treat cognitive symptoms in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), cognitive remediation programs has been proposed as a possible procognitive intervention but findings are not conclusive. This study investigates the efficacy of an INtegral Cognitive REMediation (INCREM) that includes a combination of a Functional Remediation (FR) strategy plus a Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) in order to improve not only cognitive performance but also the psychosocial functioning and the quality of life. A single blind randomized controlled clinical trial in 81 patients with a diagnosis of MDD in clinical remission or in partial remission. Participants will be randomized to one of three conditions: INCREM (FR&#x2009;+&#x2009;CCT), Psychoeducation plus online games and Treatment As Usual (TAU). Intervention will consist in 12 group sessions, of approximately 110&#x2009;min once a week. The primary outcome measure will be % of change in psychosocial functioning after treatment measured by the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST); additionally, number of sick leaves and daily activities will also be recorded as pragmatic outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled clinical trial using a combination of two different approaches (FR&#x2009;+&#x2009;CCT) to treat the present cognitive deficits and to promote their improvements into a better psychosocial functioning. Clinical Trials NCT03624621 . Date registered 10th of August 2018 and last updated 24th August 2018.
