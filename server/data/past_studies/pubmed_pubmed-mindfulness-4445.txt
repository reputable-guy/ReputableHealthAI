Study Title: A virtual, group-based mindfulness intervention for midlife and older women with low libido lowers sexual distress in a randomized controlled pilot study.

Study Summary:
Distressing low libido is common among women and has significant negative impacts; mindfulness has shown promise to increase sexual desire in women with low libido, but existing interventions are not tailored to midlife and older women. We adapted a mindfulness intervention to meet the needs of this population and conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess feasibility and acceptability. Women aged &#x2265;45&#xa0;years with low libido were randomized to the mindfulness intervention or an education group that met over videoconferencing. The intervention included mindfulness instruction and practice, group discussion, and education on sexuality and aging. The education group included general information on menopause and health. We defined feasibility by the number of screened women who enrolled and completed their group. We defined acceptability as satisfaction with the group and likelihood of recommending it to another woman with low libido. We assessed sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index) and sexual distress (Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised) at 6&#xa0;weeks postconclusion. Of 81 women screened, 31 were randomized to mindfulness and 30 to education. Eighteen women in the intervention group and 23 in the control group attended at least 1 session. Time conflict was the main reason for nonattendance. Of the 41 women who started attending groups, 37 (90%) attended at least 5 sessions. In the mindfulness group, 73% of women were very or extremely satisfied. Women in the mindfulness group were more likely to recommend it to another person with low libido as compared with those in the education group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.031); 67% said that they would probably or definitely recommend it. There were no significant changes in sexual function in either group (mean Female Sexual Function Index score, 22.6 to 18.6 [P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.101] with mindfulness and 21.2 to 19.7 [P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.537] with education). Women in the mindfulness group had significant improvements in sexual distress (mean Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised score, 27.1 to 19.7; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.021) while women in the education group did not (19.0 to 15.8; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.062). Mindfulness may reduce sexual distress in older women with low libido. This is the first trial testing mindfulness for midlife and older women with low libido. A virtual mindfulness intervention for midlife and older women with low libido is feasible and acceptable and appears to improve sexual distress as compared with an education control; these findings provide data that can be used to design a larger clinical trial.
