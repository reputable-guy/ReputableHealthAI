Study Title: [To study the effectiveness and impact on the quality of life of patients with subclinical and clinically pronounced anxiety disorder of a mobile application in combination with Adaptol therapy].

Study Summary:
To study the effectiveness and the quality of life impact of the mobile application Zdorovye.ru in people with subclinical and clinical anxiety disorder (AD). 200 patients with more than 7 points on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were included. Participants were randomized into two groups: experimental one (EG,=133) - to receive standard treatment with temgicoluril (Adaptol), 500 mg (Olainfarm JSC, Latvia) and the Zdorovye.ru application; control group (CG,=52) - standard treatment with temgicoluril (Adaptol). There were a significant decrease in the HADS-A score, PSS-10 score and an increase in the visual analog scale EQ-5D score in both groups after 3 months of treatment (<0.001). Clinical improvement was noticeable after 1.5 months in EG group: a decrease in HADS-A scores (=0.001) and in tension and stress on PSS-10 subscales (<0.001) were noted. This effect was not observed in the CG. After 3 months, all participants noted an improvement in quality of life (<0.001), without a statistically significant difference between groups (=0.233). The application left a positive impression on users and doctors - most respondents rated it as useful and clear. Taking temgicoluril (Adaptol) for 3 months led to symptoms decrease and the quality of life and well-being improvement in patients with AD. Using the mobile application Zdorovye.ru in conjunction with drug therapy made it possible to achieve a clinical effect earlier, in 1.5 months.
