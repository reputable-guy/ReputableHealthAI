Study Title: Pet Wellness and Vitamin A: A Narrative Overview.

Study Summary:
The health of companion animals, particularly dogs and cats, is significantly influenced by nutrition, with vitamins playing a crucial role. Vitamin A, in particular, is indispensable, with diverse roles ranging from vision to immune modulation and reproduction. Despite its importance, the metabolism and dietary requirements of vitamin A in companion animals remain complex and not fully understood. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the historical perspective, the digestion, the metabolism, the physiological roles, the deficiency, the excess, and the interactions with other micronutrients of vitamin A in companion animals. Additionally, it highlights future research directions and gaps in our understanding. Insights into the metabolism of vitamin A in companion animals, personalized nutrition strategies based on genetic variability, longitudinal studies tracking the status of vitamin A, and investigations into its immunomodulatory effects are crucial for optimizing pet health and wellness. Furthermore, understanding the stability and bioavailability of vitamin A in pet food formulations is essential for ensuring the provision of adequate micronutrients. Overall, this review underscores the importance of vitamin A in companion animal nutrition and the need for further research to enhance our understanding and to optimize dietary recommendations for pet health and well-being.
