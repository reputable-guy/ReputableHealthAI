Study Title: The effectiveness of care robots in alleviating physical burden and pain for caregivers: Non-randomized prospective interventional study - Preliminary study.

Study Summary:
Caregiver burden significantly affects both patients and caregivers but is often overlooked in clinical practice. Physical and emotional strain on caregivers can compromise the quality of care. Care robots are emerging as solutions to alleviate these burdens by assisting with routine tasks, thereby reducing caregivers' physical strain and stress. Therefore, a prospective, non-randomized, interventional clinical trial was designed to identify changes in caregivers' physical activities due to care robot use and explore the associated benefits. Twenty-two caregivers (1 male and 21 female; mean age, 62.05 years) were participated. We analyzed the impact of care robots on reducing physical burden and assessed caregivers' satisfaction with these robots by examining care activity history, pain levels, muscle activities, and data for each physical care activity (e.g., transfer, reposition, feeding, and toileting), categorizing them based on whether a care robot was used. Care robots that assist in transfer, repositioning, feeding, and toileting activities were used in a clinical trial. Muscle activity was measured during maximum voluntary isometric contraction using electromyography sensors placed on the upper trapezius, biceps brachii, and erector spinae muscles. During care robot use, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the distance and number of steps required for assisting with repositioning. However, the caregiving activity time increased when the robots assisted with transfer, feeding, and toileting (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001). Pain was significantly reduced during transfer and toileting activities using the care robot (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001) as well as during feeding activity (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.040). Maximum voluntary isometric contraction showed a significant reduction in the upper trapezius, biceps brachii, and erector spinae muscles during the 4 care activities when using the robot, and these findings were consistent across the 3 sessions (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001). In the survey, caregivers indicated that "transfer-assisting" care robots were the most needed (15 respondents, 68.2%). In this study, we demonstrated that employing care robots can aid in mitigating muscle overuse among caregivers, potentially alleviating pain due to musculoskeletal conditions.
