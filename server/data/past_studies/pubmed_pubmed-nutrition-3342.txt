Study Title: A data-driven approach to improve wellness and reduce recurrence in cancer survivors.

Study Summary:
For many cancer survivors, toxic side effects of treatment, lingering effects of the aftermath of disease and cancer recurrence adversely affect quality of life (QoL) and reduce healthspan. Data-driven approaches for quantifying and improving wellness in healthy individuals hold great promise for improving the lives of cancer survivors. The data-driven strategy will also guide personalized nutrition and exercise recommendations that may help prevent cancer recurrence and secondary malignancies in survivors.
