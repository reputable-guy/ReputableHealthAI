Study Title: Coronary Artery Calcium and Cognitive Decline in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study.

Study Summary:
Background Our aim was to investigate the association of coronary artery calcium (CAC) with cognitive function in adults with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. Methods and Results The Diabetes Prevention Program was a randomized controlled trial comparing an intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin, or placebo for prevention of type 2 diabetes among patients with prediabetes. After 3&#x2009;years, intensive lifestyle intervention and placebo were stopped, the metformin arm was unmasked, and participants continued in the DPPOS (Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study). Approximately 14&#x2009;years after randomization (Y14), CAC (Agatston score) was assessed with computed tomography, and cognitive performance was assessed with the Spanish English Verbal Learning Test (SEVLT) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test. SEVLT and Digit Symbol Substitution Test were reassessed 5&#x2009;years later (Y19) along with the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between CAC and cognition among 1931 participants using linear and logistic regression. In unadjusted analyses, compared with no calcification, CAC score >300 was associated with decreased performance on all cognitive tests at Y14 in both sexes. Additionally, CAC >300 was associated with a greater 5-year decline in SEVLT Immediate Recall in both sexes and SEVLT Delayed Recall in women. After adjustment for demographic, genetic, metabolic, vascular, and behavioral covariates, CAC score >300 remained associated with greater decline in only SEVLT Delayed Recall in women. Conclusions In women with prediabetes or diabetes, CAC >300, compared with no calcification, was independently associated with greater decline in verbal memory.
