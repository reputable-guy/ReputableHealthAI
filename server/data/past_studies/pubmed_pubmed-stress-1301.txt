Study Title: Ultraviolet Light Causes Skin Cell Senescence: From Mechanism to Prevention Principle.

Study Summary:
The skin is an effective protective barrier that significantly protects the body from damage caused by external environmental factors. Furthermore, skin condition significantly affects external beauty. In today's era, which is of material and spiritual prosperity, there is growing attention on skincare and wellness. Ultraviolet radiation is one of the most common external factors that lead to conditions like sunburn, skin cancer, and skin aging. In this review, several mechanisms of UV-induced skin cell senescence are discussed, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which have their own characteristics and mutual effects. As an illustration, mitochondrial dysfunction triggers electron evasion and the generation of more reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn causes mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) damage. Based on the current mechanism, suitable prevention and treatment strategies are proposed from sunscreen, dietary, and experimental medications respectively, aimed at slowing down skin cell aging and providing protection from ultraviolet radiation. The effects of ultraviolet rays on skin is summarized, offering insights and directions for future studies on mechanism of skin cell senescence, with an anticipation of discovering more effective prevention and cure methods.
