Study Title: The effect of ischemic preconditioning on repeated sprint cycling performance: a randomized crossover study.

Study Summary:
Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has been suggested to improve exercise performance by 1-8%. Prior research concerning its impact on short-duration exercises, such as sprints, has been limited and yielded conflicting results. The aim of this study, which included a non-occlusion-based placebo control, was to determine whether IPC improves repeated sprint performance in a manner that accounted for psychophysiological effects. Twenty-two healthy males participated in this study, which employed a randomized crossover design. Following the 10-min baseline period, participants received intervention under four different conditions: 1) no-intervention control (CON); 2) non-occlusion-based placebo control (SHAM); 3) remote IPC (RIPC); and 4) local IPC (LIPC). Participants then performed a standardized repeated sprint cycling (5&#xd7;10s maximal cycling sprint, separated by a 40-s rest in each set). Repeated sprint performance, as indexed by average power output, peak power output, and total work, the improvement was observed in the RIPC and LIPC during the initial phase (set 1-3) when compared with CON (P<0.05). SHAM condition also showed an increase in peak power output in the set 1 (CON 9.97&#xb1;1.05 vs. SHAM 10.30&#xb1;1.13 w/kg, P<0.05), which may represent a psychophysiological component in the IPC-induced improvement. Higher lactate concertation was found in the SHAM and LIPC groups, than in the CON group, 5 minutes after the exercise (CON 15.72&#xb1;0.68 vs. SHAM 16.82&#xb1;0.41 vs. LIPC 17.19&#xb1;0.39 mmol/L, P<0.0001 for both, respectively). In conclusion, LIPC enhanced repeated sprint cycling performance during the initial phase, beyond what could be accounted for entirely by a psychophysiological effect. The improvement associated with RIPC, however, did not surpass the effect of a placebo intervention.
