Study Title: Impact of Manual Sustained Inflation vs Stepwise PEEP on Pulmonary and Cerebral Outcomes in Carotid Endarterectomy Patients.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND Recruitment maneuvers (RMs) are used to reduce pulmonary atelectasis in patients under general anesthesia, but they can lead to a decrease in cerebral hemodynamics. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were randomized to a manual sustained inflation (SI) group or a stepwise increase in PEEP (IP) group. During both RMs, the peak airway pressure (Ppeak) was maintained at 30 cmH&#x2082;O for 30 s. Electrical impedance tomography was used to evaluate pulmonary aeration changes. Mean velocity of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery (Vm) and cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO&#x2082;) was monitored intraoperatively. RESULTS IP improved lung aeration better at Ppeak=30 cmH&#x2082;O than SI (58.2&#xb1;8.4% vs 46.0&#xb1;8.3%, P=0.001) and this persisted until the end of surgery. Dorsal (dependent) ventilation 30 min after extubation in the SI group was lower than that before surgery (7.7&#xb1;2.6% vs 9.9&#xb1;3.8%, P=0.003). Vm and rScO&#x2082; returned to baseline immediately after RM in the SI group, while it remained below baseline in the IP group (42.5&#xb1;12.6 vs 50.9&#xb1;18.8 cm/s, P<0.001 and 68.1&#xb1;3.5% vs 70.6&#xb1;3.7%, P=0.001). Heart rate declined significantly during RM only in the SI group (55.9&#xb1;6.6 vs 52.2&#xb1;6.9 bpm, P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS Compared with SI, IP performed better in improving lung aeration, with greater hemodynamic stability. IP resulted in slower recovery of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation.
