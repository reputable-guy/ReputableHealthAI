Study Title: Effect of exercise given to factory workers with ergonomics training on pain and functionality: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Exercise and manual therapy are used with pharmacological interventions to manage low back pain and prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders. However, the potential benefits of incorporating exercise and ergonomics training for factory workers experiencing low back pain have not been definitively established. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of ergonomics training with exercises on pain, functionality, sleep, and fatigue among factory employees experiencing low back pain. This research was conducted as a randomized controlled trial involving workers with back pain employed in a plastic molding factory in Gebze, Kocaeli. Both groups received ergonomics training, but only the experimental group was given exercise training inclusive of stretching and core stabilization exercises. The workers in the experimental group were instructed to perform the exercises regularly for three days a week over a period of eight weeks. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used for pre-and post-treatment assessment. The ODI, FSS, PSQI, and MPQ scores were significantly reduced in both groups. In the intergroup comparison, the exercise group showed a significantly greater decrease in all test scores compared to the control group. The exercise group showed a statistically significant decrease in ODI, FSS, MPQ, and PSQI scores compared to the control group. This study demonstrated that exercise is a more effective practice than ergonomic training for factory workers suffering from chronic low back pain.
