Study Title: HIIT at Home: Enhancing Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Older Adults-A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 6-month home-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention to improve peak oxygen consumption (V&#x307;Opeak) and lactate threshold (LT) in older adults. Two hundred thirty-three healthy older adults (60-84&#x2009;years; 54% females) were randomly assigned to either 6-month, thrice-weekly home-based HIIT (once-weekly circuit training and twice-weekly interval training) or a passive control group. Exercise sessions were monitored using a Polar watch and a logbook for objective and subjective data, respectively, and guided by a personal coach. The outcomes were assessed using a modified Balke protocol combining V&#x307;Opeak and LT measures. General linear regression models assessed between-group differences in change and within-group changes for each outcome. There was a significant between-group difference in the pre-to-post change in V&#x307;Opeak (difference: 1.8 [1.2; 2.3] mL/kg/min; exercise: +1.4 [1.0; 1.7] mL/kg/min [~5%]; control: -0.4 [-0.8; -0.0] mL/kg/min [approximately -1.5%]; effect size [ES]: 0.35). Compared with controls, the exercise group had lower blood lactate concentration (-0.7 [-0.9; -0.4] mmol/L, ES: 0.61), % of peak heart rate (-4.4 [-5.7; -3.0], ES: 0.64), and % of V&#x307;Opeak (-4.5 [-6.1; -2.9], ES: 0.60) at the intensity corresponding to preintervention LT and achieved a higher treadmill stage (% incline) at LT (0.6 [0.3; 0.8]; ES: 0.47), following the intervention. This study highlights the effectiveness of a home-based HIIT intervention as an accessible and equipment-minimal strategy to induce clinically meaningful improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults. Over 6&#x2009;months, the exercise group showed larger improvements in all outcomes compared with the control group. Notably, the LT outcome exhibited a more pronounced magnitude of change than V&#x307;Opeak.
