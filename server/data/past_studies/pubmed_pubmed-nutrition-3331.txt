Study Title: Differential effect by chronic disease risk: A secondary analysis of the ChooseWell 365 randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Whether employees' health status is associated with the effectiveness of workplace health promotion programs is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if the effect of a workplace healthy eating intervention differed by baseline chronic disease status. This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial conducted September 2016 to February 2018 among US hospital employees to test the effect of a 12-month behavioral intervention (personalized feedback, peer comparisons, and financial incentives) on diet and weight. Participants were classified as having chronic disease (yes/no) based on self-reported hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, stroke, pre-diabetes, diabetes, cancer or another serious illness. BMI was measured at study visits and calories purchased were measured from cafeteria sales data over 24&#xa0;months. Mixed models with random effects assessed heterogeneity of treatment effects by chronic disease. Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;548) were mostly female (79.7&#xa0;%) and white (81.2&#xa0;%); 224 (40.9&#xa0;%) had chronic disease. Among those with chronic disease, intervention participants reduced caloric intake by 74.4 [22.3] kcal more than control, with a smaller difference between intervention and control (-1.9 [18.7] kcal) (three-way p-interaction&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02). The effect on BMI for those with chronic disease (0.47 [0.21] kg/m) indicated weight stability among intervention participants and weight gain among controls while the effect (-0.56 [0.18] kg/m) for those without chronic disease was the opposite (three-way p-interaction&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). Those with chronic diseases had greater reductions in calories purchased and gained less weight. Employers with limited resources for health promotion might consider tailoring programs to employees at highest risk.
