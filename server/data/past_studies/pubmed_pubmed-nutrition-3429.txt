Study Title: Assessment of the impact of a personalised nutrition intervention in impaired glucose regulation over 26&#xa0;weeks: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Dietary interventions can reduce progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in people with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia. In this study we aimed to determine the impact of a DNA-personalised nutrition intervention in people with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia over 26&#xa0;weeks. ASPIRE-DNA was a pilot study. Participants were randomised into three arms to receive either (i) Control arm: standard care (NICE guidelines) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51), (ii) Intervention arm: DNA-personalised dietary advice (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50), or (iii) Exploratory arm: DNA-personalised dietary advice via a self-guided app and wearable device (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46). The primary outcome was the difference in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between the Control and Intervention arms after 6&#xa0;weeks. 180 people were recruited, of whom 148 people were randomised, mean age of 59&#xa0;years (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;11), 69% of whom were female. There was no significant difference in the FPG change between the Control and Intervention arms at 6&#xa0;weeks (-&#x2009;0.13&#xa0;mmol/L (95% CI [-&#x2009;0.37, 0.11]), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.29), however, we found that a DNA-personalised dietary intervention led to a significant reduction of FPG at 26&#xa0;weeks in the Intervention arm when compared to standard care (-&#x2009;0.019 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), as did the Exploratory arm (-&#x2009;0.021 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). HbA1c at 26&#xa0;weeks was significantly reduced in the Intervention arm when compared to standard care (-&#x2009;0.038 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). There was some evidence suggesting prevention of progression to T2DM across the groups that received a DNA-based intervention (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.06). Personalisation of dietary advice based on DNA did not result in glucose changes within the first 6&#xa0;weeks but was associated with significant reduction of FPG and HbA1c at 26&#xa0;weeks when compared to standard care. The DNA-based diet was effective regardless of intervention type, though results should be interpreted with caution due to the low sample size. These findings suggest that DNA-based dietary guidance is an effective intervention compared to standard care, but there is still a minimum timeframe of adherence to the intervention before changes in clinical outcomes become apparent.Trial Registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov.uk Ref: NCT03702465.
