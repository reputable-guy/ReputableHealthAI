Study Title: Moderate dietary salt restriction improves blood pressure and mental well-being in patients with primary aldosteronism: The salt CONNtrol trial.

Study Summary:
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a frequent cause of hypertension. Aldosterone excess together with high dietary salt intake aggravates cardiovascular damage, despite guideline-recommended mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment. To investigate the antihypertensive impact of a moderate dietary salt restriction and associated physiological changes, including mental well-being. A total of 41 patients with PA on a stable antihypertensive regimen-including MRA-followed a dietary salt restriction for 12 weeks with structured nutritional training and consolidation by a mobile health app. Salt intake and adherence were monitored every 4 weeks using 24-h urinary sodium excretion and nutrition protocols. Body composition was assessed by bioimpedance analysis and mental well-being by validated questionnaires. Dietary salt intake significantly decreased from 9.1 to 5.2&#xa0;g/d at the end of the study. In parallel, systolic (130 vs. 121&#xa0;mm&#xa0;Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (84 vs. 81&#xa0;mm&#xa0;Hg) improved significantly. Patients' aptitude of estimating dietary salt content was refined significantly (underestimation by 2.4 vs. 1.4&#xa0;g/d). Salt restriction entailed a significant weight loss of 1.4&#xa0;kg, improvement in pulse pressure (46 vs. 40&#xa0;mm&#xa0;Hg) and normalization of depressive symptoms (PHQD scale, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Salt restriction, cortisol after dexamethasone suppression test and dosage of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) blockers were independently associated with BP reduction. A moderate restriction of dietary salt intake in patients with PA substantially reduces BP and depressive symptoms. Moreover, the findings underline that a sufficient RAAS blockade seems to augment the effects of salt restriction on BP and cardiovascular risk.
