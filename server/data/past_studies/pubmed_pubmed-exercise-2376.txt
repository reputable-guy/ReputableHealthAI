Study Title: ChatGPT-4 and wearable device assisted Intelligent Exercise Therapy for co-existing Sarcopenia and Osteoarthritis (GAISO): a feasibility study and design for a randomized controlled PROBE non-inferiority trial.

Study Summary:
Sarcopenia and osteoarthritis are prevalent age-related diseases that mutually exacerbate each other, creating a vicious cycle that worsens both conditions. Exercise is key to breaking this detrimental cycle. Facing increasing demand for rehabilitation services within this patient demographic, ChatGPT-4 and wearable device may increase the availability, efficiency and personalization of such health care. To evaluate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a rehabilitation system implemented on mobile platforms, utilizing the integration of ChatGPT-4 and wearable devices. The study design is a prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) non-inferiority trial. 278 patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis and sarcopenia will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group. In the intervention group patients receive mobile phone-based rehabilitation service where ChatGPT-4 generates personalized exercise therapy, and wearable device guides and monitor the patient to implement the exercise therapy. Traditional clinic based face-to-face exercise therapy will be prescribed and implemented in the control group. All patients will receive three-months exercise therapies following the frequency, intensity, type, time, volume and progression (FITT-VP) principle. The patients will be assessed at baseline, one month, three months, and six months after initiation. Outcome measures will include ROM, gait patterns, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain assessment, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for functional assessment, Short-Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12) for quality of life, Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID), Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS), and Substantial Clinical Benefit (SCB) for clinically significant measures. A rehabilitation system combining the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 and wearable devices potentially enhance the availability and efficiency of professional rehabilitation services, thus enhancing the therapeutic outcomes for a substantial population concurrently afflicted with sarcopenia and osteoarthritis.
