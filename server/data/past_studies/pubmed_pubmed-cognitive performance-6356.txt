Study Title: Effects of multisite anodal transcranial direct current stimulation combined with cognitive stimulation in patients with Alzheimer's disease and its neurophysiological correlates: A double-blind randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
We aimed to examine the effects of multisite anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with cognitive stimulation (CS) over 2 months on cognitive performance and brain activity, and the relationship between them, in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with AD were randomly assigned to an active tDCS+CS (n=18) or a sham tDCS+CS (n=18) group. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and brain activity using EEG (spectral power and coherence analysis) before and after the intervention. Multisite anodal tDCS (2 mA, 30 min) was applied over six brain regions [left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3 and F4), Broca's area (F5), Wernicke's area (CP5), left and right somatosensory association cortex (P3 and P4)] for 24 sessions (three times a week). Both groups performed CS during tDCS. Anodal tDCS+CS delays cognitive decline (ADAS-cog change) to a greater extent than sham tDCS+CS (-3.4&#xb1;1.1 vs. -1.7&#xb1;0.4; p=.03). Bilateral EEG coherence at high and low frequencies was greater for the active tDCS+CS than sham+CS group for most electrode pairs assessed (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05). The post-intervention ADAS-cog change score was predictive for EEG coherence at different sites (R&#xb2;=.59 to .68; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05) in the active but not in the sham tDCS+CS group. Anodal tDCS+CS improved overall cognitive function and changed EEG brain activity compared to sham tDCS+CS. Changes in cognitive performance were associated with changes in EEG measures of brain activity. Anodal tDCS+CS appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy to modulate cortical activity and improve cognitive function in patients with AD.
