Study Title: The RELAX randomized controlled trial: Stretching versus meditation for nocturnal muscle cramps.

Study Summary:
Muscle cramps are common among persons with cirrhosis and are associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Treatment options are limited. We compared stretching or meditation in a randomized-controlled trial (RCT). We enrolled 98 patients with a history of >4 muscle cramps in the prior month from 7/22-7/23. We randomized patients 1:1 to stretching versus meditation for 35&#x2009;days. Our primary outcome was the change in cramp severity measured by the visual analogue scale for cramps (VAS-cramps, scaled 0-10). Secondary outcomes included a patient global impression of change (PGIC), change in sleep quality and global HRQOL measured using the EQ-5D and VAS-global HRQOL. Overall, 48% of patients had cirrhosis, 40% had diabetes, 16% the median age was 63, most were women (67%) and 81% were college educated. Both arms experienced a reduction in cramp severity-a median of 1.44 (.58-2.29) points for stretching and 1.97 (1.01-2.93) points for meditation. These changes were significant changes from baseline (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001 for stretching, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.0001 for meditation) but these changes were equivalent between arms (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.4). The PGIC was improved: 1.33 (1.02-1.65) for stretching, 1.05 (.70-1.41) for meditation, p-difference .2. Sleep was also improved for both. HRQOL did not change according to the Eq5D; according to the VAS, HRQOL rose for meditation by 6 (.1-11.8) points but not for stretching. More patients recommended stretching than meditation (79.2% vs. 55.3%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02). In a randomized trial, stretching and meditation both reduced cramp severity and improved sleep quality and global impression of change. While patients preferred stretching, there was no difference in effect between arms.
