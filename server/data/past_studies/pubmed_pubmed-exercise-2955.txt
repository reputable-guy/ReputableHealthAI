Study Title: Exercise-Induced Oxygen Desaturation Increases Arterial Stiffness in Patients with COPD During the 6WMT.

Study Summary:
Given the established impact of exercise in reducing arterial stiffness and the potential for intermittent hypoxia to induce its elevation, this study aims to understand how oxygen desaturation during exercise affects arterial stiffness in individuals with COPD. We enrolled patients with stable COPD from China-Japan Friendship Hospital from November 2022 to June 2023. The 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) was performed with continuous blood oxygen saturation (SpO) monitoring in these patients. The patients were classified into three groups: non-exercise induced desaturation (EID), mild-EID and severe-EID, according to the changes in SpOduring the 6-MWT. The Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) and the change in CAVI (&#x394;CAVI, calculated as CAVI before 6MWT minus CAVI after the 6MWT) were measured before and immediately after the 6MWT to assess the acute effects of exercise on arterial stiffness. GOLD Stage, pulmonary function, and other functional outcomes were also measured in this study. A total of 37 patients with stable COPD underwent evaluation for changes in CAVI (&#x394;CAVI) before and after the 6-MWT. Stratification based on revealed three subgroups: non-EID (n=12), mild-EID (n=15), and severe-EID (n=10). The &#x394;CAVI values was -0.53 (-0.95 to -0.31) in non-EID group, -0.20 (-1.45 to 0.50) in mild-EID group, 0.6 (0.08 to 0.73) in severe-EID group. Parametric tests indicated significant differences in &#x394;CAVI among EID groups (p = 0.005). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant distinctions between mild-EID and severe-EID groups, as well as between non-EID and severe-EID groups (p = 0.048 and p = 0.003, respectively). Multivariable analysis, adjusting for age, sex, GOLD stage, diffusion capacity, and blood pressure, identified severe-EID as an independent factor associated with &#x394;CAVI (B = 1.118, p = 0.038). Patients with COPD and severe-EID may experience worsening arterial stiffness even during short periods of exercise.
