Study Title: Effects of acute rope skipping exercises of different exercise modes on cognitive function in 9-10-year-old children.

Study Summary:
To explore the effects of acute high-intensity interval rope skipping exercise and acute moderate-intensity continuous rope skipping exercise on cognitive function in 9-10-year-old children, this study aims to inform the selection of appropriate jump rope methods for cognitive training in physical activities. A total of 60 students from two classes of fourth grade in a primary school were selected as research subjects. After matching according to gender, they were randomly divided into HIIT group, MICT group and control group. The Digit Span Test (DST),&#xa0;Attention Network Test (ANT) and Stroop Color Word Test were conducted three days before the intervention and 5&#xa0;min after the intervention. During the intervention, the HIIT group performed a high-intensity intermittent rope skipping exercise (required fast jumping with feet together, practice for 1&#xa0;min and rest for 1&#xa0;min, jump continuously for 5 groups, and the exercise intensity is &#x2265;&#x2009;85% of the maximum heart rate), while the MICT group performed a moderate-intensity continuous rope skipping exercise (required to medium jumping with feet together,&#xa0;jump continuously for 5 min,&#xa0;and the exercise intensity is 60-80% of the maximum heart rate), and the control group rests in place. After the intervention, both HIIT and MICT groups showed increased DST total scores, improved executive control network efficiency, and faster inhibitory control response speeds, with no significant changes in accuracy. The HIIT group also exhibited increased orienting network efficiency and no significant changes in accuracy. Acute rope skipping exercises using HIIT and MICT methods can improve the working memory, executive control network efficiency and inhibitory control ability of children aged 9-10 years old. Additionally, conducting acute rope skipping exercises using HIIT method can also enhance their orienting network efficiency.
