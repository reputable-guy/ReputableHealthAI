Study Title: Clinical Characteristics of Necrotizing Enterocolitis Diagnosed by Independent Adjudication of Abdominal Radiographs, Laparotomy, or Autopsy in Preterm Infants in the "Connection Trial".

Study Summary:
&#x2003;Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) classically is diagnosed by radiographic demonstration of pneumatosis intestinalis/portal venous gas (PI/PVG). This study examines clinical characteristics of NEC confirmed by independent evaluation of abdominal radiographs, taken for clinical signs of NEC, or by pathologic findings at laparotomy or autopsy (confirmed NEC [cNEC]). &#x2003;The investigated cohort included 1,382 extremely low birth weight (BW) infants (BW range: 500-1,000&#x2009;g) with median 27 weeks (range: 23-32) gestational age (GA) at birth. They were randomized into the placebo-controlled "Connection Trial" of the new biological drug candidate IBP-9414 with cNEC as one primary endpoint. &#x2003;Total 119 infants (8.6%) had cNEC diagnosed at median 14 days of age by confirming PI/PVG at X-ray adjudication (&#x2009;=&#x2009;111) and/or by surgery/autopsy (&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). Sixteen percent of cNEC cases died. Adverse events of NEC were reported in 8.5% of infants and 4.1% had NEC diagnosed by radiology and surgery/autopsy at the participating centers. Regression analyses showed that the risk of cNEC decreased by 11 to 30% for every 100-g increment in BW and single-week increment in GA and associated cNEC with odds ratios (ORs)&#x2009;>&#x2009;2.0 for gastrointestinal (GI) perforation and obstruction, hypotension, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and death. Comparing risks of cNEC in infants below and above 750-g BW showed higher ORs (2.7-4.3) for GI perforation, hypotension, hypokalemia, and renal complications in the smaller infants, whereas the bigger infants had higher ORs (1.9-3.2) for serious non-GI events, late-onset sepsis (LOS), and death. Predictors of cNEC (hazard ratio, HR&#x2009;>&#x2009;1.5) included serious non-GI events (mainly infections), hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia, whereas the HR was 0.52 for intravenous antibiotics. After cNEC diagnosis, there were higher rates of GI perforation and obstruction, hypotension, hypokalemia, and LOS. &#x2003;Independent adjudication of abdominal radiographs increased radiological recognition of NEC and proved to be feasible in a multicenter study setting as well as able to diagnose clinically relevant NEC. &#xb7; Independent adjudication of abdominal radiographs in ELBW infants increased NEC recognition.. &#xb7; Risk of NEC decreased by 11 to 30% with every 100-g increment in BW and GA week.. &#xb7; In infants with BW 750 to 1,000&#x2009;g, the risk of death from NEC was almost twice that in infants with BW 500 to 749&#x2009;g. &#xb7; Infants with NEC received antibiotics during one-third and parenteral nutrition during half of the first 7 postnatal weeks..
