Study Title: Rapid and sustained improvements in itch and quality of life with upadacitinib plus topical corticosteroids in adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis: 52-week outcomes from the phase 3 AD Up study.

Study Summary:
Atopic dermatitis (AD) adversely impacts quality of life (QoL). We evaluated the effect of upadacitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase inhibitor approved for moderate-to-severe AD, plus topical corticosteroids (+TCS) on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) over 52&#x2009;weeks.In the phase 3 AD Up study (NCT03568318), adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily upadacitinib 15&#x2009;mg, 30&#x2009;mg, or placebo&#x2009;+&#x2009;TCS. Itch, skin pain/symptoms, sleep, QoL, daily activities, emotional state, mental health, and patient impressions of disease severity/improvement/treatment satisfaction were assessed.This analysis included 901 patients. Within 1-2&#x2009;weeks, PRO improvements were greater with both upadacitinib doses than with placebo (<.05). Improvements increased through weeks 4-8; rates were generally maintained through week 52. At week 52, the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvements in itch (Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale improvement &#x2265;4), skin pain (AD Symptom Scale Skin Pain improvement &#x2265;4), sleep (AD Impact Scale [ADerm-IS] Sleep improvement &#x2265;12), daily activities (ADerm-IS Daily Activities improvement &#x2265;14), and emotional state (ADerm-IS Emotional State improvement &#x2265;11) ranged from 62.1%-77.7% with upadacitinib 15&#x2009;mg&#x2009;+&#x2009;TCS and 71.3%-83.6% with upadacitinib 30&#x2009;mg&#x2009;+&#x2009;TCS.Upadacitinib&#x2009;+&#x2009;TCS results in rapid, sustained improvements in burdensome AD symptoms and QoL.
