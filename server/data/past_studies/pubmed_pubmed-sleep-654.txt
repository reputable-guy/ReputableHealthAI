Study Title: Effect of prosthetic management and its timing on otological and audiological outcomes in infants with cleft lip and palate: A clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate how prosthetic management affects the otological and audiological state of infants with cleft lip and palate by preventing or treating otitis media (OM). Thirty infants with cleft lip and palate (L/P) were assigned to three equal groups according to the age of prosthetic intervention; Group I: immediately after birth, Group II: 2 months old, Group III: 5 months old. Assessment of middle ear function by tympanometry and hearing quality by auditory brainstem response (ABR) under natural sleep was conducted before and after prosthetic treatment every month till 10 months of age. Data from the study groups were compared. No statistically significant differences were found between Gp I and Gp II in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th months for right and left ears (p > 0.05). In the 5th month, statistically significant differences between the three groups were found in tympanometry for right (p = 0.011) and left (p = 0.024) ears also, in ABR for right (p = 0.007) and left (p = 0.011) ears. Tympanometric readings starting from the 6th till the 10th month showed no statistically significant differences between the three groups (p >0.05). The final ABR outcomes of the 10th month indicated statistically significant differences between the three groups for both ears (p = 0.027). Early prosthetic care could delay the development of OM, so it could potentially improve the otological and audiological state in infants with cleft L/P. However, prosthetic treatment may not be able to completely prevent or eliminate middle ear disorders.
