Study Title: Integrative Neuro-social cognitive Strategy Programme for Instilling REcovery (INSPIRE): a community-based cognitive remediation trial-study procotol.

Study Summary:
Adults with schizophrenia experience a range of neurocognitive problems that affect their daily functioning. Evidence for the efficacy of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia has been established, but its implementation in under-resourced community-based settings is less well-studied. In recent years, interventions have also focused on the strategy-learning approach in favor of drill-and-practice. Moreover, there is an increasing recognition to address social cognition and negative symptoms alongside neurocognition. This study attempts to carry out cognitive remediation in a community mental health setting. The Neuropsychological and Educational Approach to Remediation (NEAR) is used as the cognitive remediation intervention. Neurocognitive and social cognitive games will be introduced during the computer-assisted cognitive exercises sessions. In addition, the instructional technique will foster the use of metacognition and cognitive strategies. Moreover, metamotivation training will be the focus of some bridging sessions to enhance motivation to engage in goal-directed learning behaviors. The aims of the study are to 1) investigate the effects of cognitive remediation on neurocognition, social cognition and functional outcomes of participants with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders in community mental health settings; and 2) explore the mediators for change (eg: metamotivation, metacognition and negative symptoms) in cognitive performance and functional outcomes. This randomized controlled trial will be conducted in three Singapore Anglican Community Services (SACS) centers, where standard psychiatric rehabilitation is delivered. Participants who are randomized to the experimental arm will receive cognitive remediation and psychiatric rehabilitation, while those randomized to the control arm will receive standard psychiatric rehabilitation only. Cognitive remediation is carried out three times a week for 12&#xa0;weeks. It consists of computer-assisted cognitive exercises, as well as bridging groups to aid transfer of learning to daily living. Baseline, post-intervention and eight-week follow-up measurements will be collected. Group by time differences in cognitive performance, negative symptoms, metamotivation, metacognition, functioning and recovery will be analyzed across the three time points. Mediators for improvement in cognitive performance and functioning will also be explored. Findings of this research will add to the body of knowledge about the key therapeutic ingredients within a strategy-based cognitive remediation program and improve its implementation within under-resourced community settings.
