Study Title: Sulforaphane upregulates the mRNA expression of NRF2 and NQO1 in non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease.

Study Summary:
Sulforaphane (SFN), found in cruciferous vegetables, is a known activator of NRF2 (master regulator of cellular antioxidant responses). Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) present an imbalance in the redox state, presenting reduced expression of NRF2 and increased expression of NF-&#x3ba;B. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of SFN on the mRNA expression of NRF2, NF-&#x3ba;B and markers of oxidative stress in patients with CKD. Here, we observed a significant increase in the mRNA expression of NRF2 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) and NQO1 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) in the group that received 400&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/day of SFN for 1 month. Furthermore, we observed an improvement in the levels of phosphate (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02), glucose (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05) and triglycerides (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) also in this group. On the other hand, plasma levels of LDL-c (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) and total cholesterol (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03) increased in the placebo group during the study period. In conclusion, 400&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/day of SFN for one month improves the antioxidant system and serum glucose and phosphate levels in non-dialysis CKD patients.
