Study Title: Randomization to a Provided Higher-Complex-Carbohydrate Versus Conventional Diet in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Results in Similar Newborn Adiposity.

Study Summary:
Nutrition therapy for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has conventionally focused on carbohydrate restriction. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we tested the hypothesis that a diet (all meals provided) with liberalized complex carbohydrate (60%) and lower fat (25%) (CHOICE diet) could improve maternal insulin resistance and 24-h glycemia, resulting in reduced newborn adiposity (NB%fat; powered outcome) versus a conventional lower-carbohydrate (40%) and higher-fat (45%) (LC/CONV) diet. After diagnosis (at &#x223c;28-30 weeks' gestation), 59 women with diet-controlled GDM (mean &#xb1; SEM; BMI 32 &#xb1; 1 kg/m2) were randomized to a provided LC/CONV or CHOICE diet (BMI-matched calories) through delivery. At 30-31 and 36-37 weeks of gestation, a 2-h, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was worn for 72 h. Cord blood samples were collected at delivery. NB%fat was measured by air displacement plethysmography (13.4 &#xb1; 0.4 days). There were 23 women per group (LC/CONV [214 g/day carbohydrate] and CHOICE [316 g/day carbohydrate]). For LC/CONV and CHOICE, respectively (mean &#xb1; SEM), NB%fat (10.1 &#xb1; 1 vs. 10.5 &#xb1; 1), birth weight (3,303 &#xb1; 98 vs. 3,293 &#xb1; 81 g), and cord C-peptide levels were not different. Weight gain, physical activity, and gestational age at delivery were similar. At 36-37 weeks of gestation, CGM fasting (86 &#xb1; 3 vs. 90 &#xb1; 3 mg/dL), 1-h postprandial (119 &#xb1; 3 vs. 117 &#xb1; 3 mg/dL), 2-h postprandial (106 &#xb1; 3 vs. 108 &#xb1; 3 mg/dL), percent time in range (%TIR; 92 &#xb1; 1 vs. 91 &#xb1; 1), and 24-h glucose area under the curve values were similar between diets. The %time >120 mg/dL was statistically higher (8%) in CHOICE, as was the nocturnal glucose AUC; however, nocturnal %TIR (63-100 mg/dL) was not different. There were no between-group differences in OGTT glucose and insulin levels at 36-37 weeks of gestation. A &#x223c;100 g/day difference in carbohydrate intake did not result in between-group differences in NB%fat, cord C-peptide level, maternal 24-h glycemia, %TIR, or insulin resistance indices in diet-controlled GDM.
