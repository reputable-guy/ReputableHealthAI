Study Title: [Whey protein and caseinate supplementation in oncological patients undergoing elective surgery for the modification of functional capacity].

Study Summary:
Introduction: the nutritional intervention has become a critical point to achieve the reduction of perioperative morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. There are different factors that will play a fundamental role in the evolution and prognosis of this pathology, being the state of nutrition and diet a cornerstone in these aspects. Objective: to evaluate the perioperative effect of whey protein isolate (WPI) and calcium caseinate (CaCNT) in cancer patients undergoing elective surgery. Methods: randomized controlled clinical trial with three groups: the control group (n = 15), consisting in conventional management by the oncology surgery services, and two intervention groups, one with calcium caseinate supplementation (n = 15) and another one with whey protein isolate supplementation (n = 15) for six weeks perioperatively. Handgrip strength, six-minute walk, and body composition were assessed pre and postoperatively. Results: those who were supplemented with WPI maintained their handgrip strength and showed less extracellular water (p < 0.02); also an increase in visceral mass was shown (p < 0.02). Finally, a correlation was found with variables associated with body composition and patient evolution when compared to the control group. Conclusions: nutritional supplementation needs to be approached from the functional and metabolic point of view to identify factors that have a favorable impact, as well as the distinction between carcinoma and the type of supplementation to be implemented.
