Study Title: Impact of Baduanjin exercise combined with rational emotive behavior therapy on sleep and mood in patients with poststroke depression: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Poststroke depression (PSD) is one of the most common stroke complications. It not only leads to a decline in patients' quality of life but also increases the mortality of patients. In this study, the method of combining Chinese traditional exercise Baduanjin with psychotherapy was used to intervene in patients with PSD and to explore the improvement of sleep, mood, and serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in patients with PSD by combined treatment. A total of 100 patients with PSD who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to Baduanjin group (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;50) or control group (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;50). The control group received treatment with escitalopram oxalate and rational emotive behavior therapy, while the experimental group received Baduanjin training in addition to the treatment given to the control group. Changes in sleep efficiency, sleep total time, sleep latency, arousal index, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale score, serum BDNF, 5-HT, IL-6 levels, and Modified Barthel Index were measured at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after intervention, and the results were compared between the 2 groups. Significantly improvements in the sleep efficiency, sleep total time, serum 5-HT, BDNF levels, and Modified Barthel Index score were detected at week 4 in the Baduanjin group than in the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Additionally, the sleep latency, arousal index, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale scores and IL-6 levels in the Baduanjin group were lower than those in the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). After 8 weeks of treatment, the above indexes in the Baduanjin group were further improved compared with the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05), and the above indexes of the 2 groups were significantly improved compared with the baseline (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001). Baduanjin exercise combined with rational emotive behavior therapy effectively improves the mood and sleep status of patients with PSD; It increases the serum levels of 5-HT and BDNF while reducing the level of serum proinflammatory factor IL-6; additionally, the intervention alleviates the degree of neurological impairment, upgrades the ability of daily living, and improves the quality of life.
