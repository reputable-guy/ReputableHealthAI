Study Title: Effects of Cannabidiol Ingestion on Thermoregulatory and Inflammatory Responses to Treadmill Exercise in the Heat in Recreationally Active Males.

Study Summary:
Exertional heat stress can induce systemic endotoxin exposure and a proinflammatory cascade, likely impairing thermoregulation. Cannabidiol (CBD) is protective in preclinical models of tissue ischemia and inflammation. Therefore, this study examined the effects of CBD ingestion on exercise-induced thermoregulatory and inflammatory responses. In a randomized, double-blinded study, 13 active males (age 25 &#xb1; 5 yr; peak oxygen uptake (V&#x307;O 2peak ) 50.4 &#xb1; 3.2 mL&#xb7;kg -1 &#xb7;min -1 ) ingested 298 mg CBD or placebo 105 min before 1 h treadmill exercise (60%-65% V&#x307;O 2peak ) in 32&#xb0;C and 50% relative humidity. Core temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, subjective outcomes, and sweat loss were assessed during/after exercise. Plasma osmolality, plasma volume changes, and plasma markers of intestinal damage (I-FABP), monocyte activation (CD14), and inflammatory cytokine responses (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#x3b1;) were assessed at baseline, pre-exercise, and 20 and 90 min post-exercise. Core temperature (&#x2206; 1.69&#xb0;C &#xb1; 0.48&#xb0;C (CBD) and 1.79&#xb0;C &#xb1; 0.53&#xb0;C (Placebo)) and I-FABP increased during exercise, with no differences between conditions ( P > 0.050). Mean (95% confidence interval) CD14 was 1776 (463 to 3090) pg&#xb7;mL -1 greater 90 min post-exercise in placebo ( P = 0.049). Median (interquartile range) peak IL-6 concentration was -0.8 (-1.1 to -0.3) pg&#xb7;mL -1 less in CBD ( P = 0.050), whereas the between-condition difference in IL-6 area under curve was -113 (-172 to 27) (pg&#xb7;mL -1 )&#xb7;270 min ( P = 0.054). CBD did not affect thermoregulation during exertional heat stress but appeared to elicit minor immunosuppressive effects, reducing CD14 and IL-6 responses, warranting investigation in humans under more severe heat strain and other proinflammatory scenarios.
