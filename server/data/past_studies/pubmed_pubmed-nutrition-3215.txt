Study Title: Effects of a Ketogenic Diet on Body Composition in Healthy, Young, Normal-Weight Women: A Randomized Controlled Feeding Trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigates the effects of a ketogenic low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diet on body composition in healthy, young, normal-weight women. With the increasing interest in ketogenic diets for their various health benefits, this research aims to understand their impact on body composition, focusing on women who are often underrepresented in such studies. Conducting a randomized controlled feeding trial with a crossover design, this study compares a ketogenic LCHF diet to a Swedish National Food Agency (NFA)-recommended control diet over four weeks. Seventeen healthy, young, normal-weight women adhered strictly to the provided diets, with ketosis confirmed through blood &#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was utilized for precise body composition measurements. To avoid bias, all statistical analyses were performed blind. The findings reveal that the ketogenic LCHF diet led to a significant reduction in both lean mass (-1.45 kg 95% CI: [-1.90;-1.00];< 0.001) and fat mass (-0.66 kg 95% CI: [-1.00;-0.32];< 0.001) compared to the control diet, despite similar energy intake and physical activity levels. This study concludes that while the ketogenic LCHF diet is effective for weight loss, it disproportionately reduces lean mass over fat mass, suggesting the need for concurrent strength training to mitigate muscle loss in women following this diet.
