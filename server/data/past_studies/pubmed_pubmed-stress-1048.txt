Study Title: Residential Meditation Retreats: A Promise of Sustainable Well-Being?

Study Summary:
Meditation retreats are structured programs that immerse participants in focused meditation, mindfulness, and self-reflection over extended periods. Unlike conventional vacations, which prioritize relaxation, meditation retreats combine intensive practice with intentional rest, cultivating emotional regulation, mindfulness, and personal growth. These retreats have grown in popularity for their ability to support mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Research shows that retreats can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression while enhancing emotional resilience. Physical benefits, including reduced inflammatory markers and improved metabolic health, further contribute to long-term well-being. Positioned within the expanding wellness tourism market, meditation retreats offer sustainable benefits that surpass those of traditional leisure activities, marking them as a promising tool in preventive healthcare. In this editorial, we examine the evidence supporting these benefits and discuss challenges, such as varied formats, limited follow-up, and accessibility issues, which limit broader application. Further research is essential to standardise protocols, evaluate cost-effectiveness, and expand access, underscoring the potential of meditation retreats as a sustainable well-being intervention in today's demanding world.
