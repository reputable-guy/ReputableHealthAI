Study Title: Effect of bilateral low serratus anterior plane block on quality of recovery after trans-subxiphoid robotic thymectomy: Results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the impact of ultrasound-guided, bilateral, low level (T8-T9) deep serratus anterior plane (DSAP) blocks on postoperative recovery quality and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing trans-subxiphoid robotic thymectomy (TRT).39 patients undergoing TRT were randomized to receive either low DSAP block under general anesthesia (Group S) or the sham block (Group C) on each side. The primary outcome was the QoR-40 score at postoperative day (POD) 1. Secondary outcomes included numeric rating scale (NRS) scores over time, postoperative 48 hours opioid consumption, QoR-40 scores at POD 2, 30, and 90.The QoR-40 scores on POD1-2 were higher in Group S than in Group C [179.1 (4.9) vs 167.7 (2.8), P < 0.01; 187.7 (4.6) vs 178.1 (3), P < 0.01, respectively]. Pain scores were significantly lower in Group S, both during resting and motion at postoperative 6h, 12h, and 24h (P < 0.05 for each). The total amount of sufentanil consumed in the first 48 h was lower in Group S than in Group C [61.4 (4.9) vs 78.9 (4.6), P < 0.001].The bilateral low DSAP blocks enhanced the QoR-40 for 2 days postoperatively, relieved postsurgical pain, and reduced opioid consumption during the early postoperative period in patients undergoing TRT.
