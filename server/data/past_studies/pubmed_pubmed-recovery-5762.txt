Study Title: Acute dose-response effect of photobiomodulation therapy on 5-km running performance in trained runners: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.

Study Summary:
Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has been advocated as a potential intervention to improve muscle performance and recovery in the health and sports context. However, the short- and long-term effects of PBMT on endurance running performance remain under-researched and controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute dose-response effect of PBMT with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on endurance performance and rating of perceived exertion (RPE; 6-20 Borg) during a 5-km running trial in recreational runners. In a crossover design, eighteen young adult runners (28.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.8 years) were randomized to receive 1 of 4 PBMT conditions (placebo, 300, 900, and 1260 Joules [J]) 60&#xa0;min before the 5-km running trial on four occasions, separated by a 2-wk washout period. The treatments were applied to the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles of both legs using a device containing 200 LEDs (100 red and 100 infrared). The following variables were assessed: endurance performance (i.e. total time, mean velocity, and velocity in the split distances at the initial 200&#xa0;m and every 400&#xa0;m lap) and RPE in the split distances at the initial 200&#xa0;m and every 400&#xa0;m lap. Data normality and homogeneity were tested using Shapiro-Wilk's and Levene's tests, respectively. Differences between treatment conditions were assessed using the analysis of variance tests (one- or two-way ANOVA, depending on the comparisons), complemented by the Bonferroni post hoc test. There were significant time effects for the running velocity and RPE in the split distances (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001), with no significant treatment-by-time interaction (running velocity, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59; RPE, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.95). The mean velocity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.997), total time (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.998), and total mean of the RPE (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91) were similar between treatment conditions. In conclusion, acute PBMT with LEDs at doses of 300, 900, and 1260&#xa0;J is not recommended for improving endurance performance and RPE in the 5-km running trial in recreational runners.
