Study Title: Postexercise muscle glycogen synthesis with glucose, galactose, and combined galactose-glucose ingestion.

Study Summary:
Ingested galactose can enhance postexercise liver glycogen repletion when combined with glucose but effects on muscle glycogen synthesis are unknown. In this double-blind randomized study participants [7 men and 2 women; V&#x307;o: 51.1 (8.7) mL&#xb7;kg&#xb7;min] completed three trials of exhaustive cycling exercise followed by a 4-h recovery period, during which carbohydrates were ingested at the rate of 1.2 g&#xb7;kg&#xb7;hcomprising glucose (GLU), galactose (GAL) or galactose&#x2009;+&#x2009;glucose (GAL&#x2009;+&#x2009;GLU; 1:2 ratio). The increase in vastus lateralis skeletal-muscle glycogen concentration during recovery was higher with GLU relative to GAL&#x2009;+&#x2009;GLU [contrast: +50 mmol&#xb7;(kg DM); 95%CL 10, 89;= 0.021] and GAL [+46 mmol&#xb7;(kg DM); 95%CL 8, 84;= 0.024] with no difference between GAL&#x2009;+&#x2009;GLU and GAL [-3 mmol&#xb7;(kg DM); 95%CL -44, 37;= 0.843]. Plasma glucose concentration in GLU was not significantly different vs. GAL&#x2009;+&#x2009;GLU (+&#x2009;0.41 mmol&#xb7;L; 95%CL 0.13, 0.94) but was significantly lower than GAL (-0.75 mmol&#xb7;L; 95%CL -1.34, -0.17) and also lower in GAL vs. GAL&#x2009;+&#x2009;GLU (-1.16 mmol&#xb7;; 95%CL -1.80, -0.53). Plasma insulin was higher in GLU&#x2009;+&#x2009;GAL and GLU compared with GAL but not different between GLU&#x2009;+&#x2009;GAL and GLU. Plasma galactose concentration was higher in GAL compared with GLU (3.35 mmol&#xb7;L; 95%CL 3.07, 3.63) and GAL&#x2009;+&#x2009;GLU (3.22 mmol&#xb7;L; 95%CL 3.54, 2.90) with no difference between GLU&#x2009;+&#x2009;GAL (0.13 mmol&#xb7;L; 95%CL -0.11, 0.37) and GLU. Compared with galactose or a galactose&#x2009;+&#x2009;glucose blend, glucose feeding was more effective in postexercise muscle glycogen synthesis. Comparable muscle glycogen synthesis was observed with galactose-glucose coingestion and exclusive galactose-only ingestion.Postexercise galactose-glucose coingestion or exclusive galactose-only ingestion resulted in a lower rate of skeletal-muscle glycogen replenishment compared with exclusive glucose-only ingestion. Comparable muscle glycogen synthesis was observed with galactose-glucose coingestion and exclusive galactose-only ingestion.
