Study Title: Two-year scale-up dissemination study of a multi-strategic community-wide intervention promoting physical activity: a single-arm pre-post hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial.

Study Summary:
Intervention trials that have demonstrated significant effects may not always replicate those effects when scaled up. This study aimed to test whether scaling-up a successful cluster randomized trial (the COMMUNICATE study, 9 intervention communities), which promoted population-level physical activity (PA), could promote PA in a broader citywide setting (29 communities) after two years, as a mid-term evaluation of the six-year scaled-up trial. This is a single-arm, pre-post comparison of a multi-strategic community-wide intervention covering the entire Unnan City, Japan. The intervention for middle-aged and older people consisted of three components: information delivery, education, and support delivery. The intervention method followed the COMMUNICATE study but adapted and introduced new initiatives tailored to local resources. A baseline survey (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3,718) among randomly selected residents aged 40-79&#xa0;years in 2016 and a follow-up survey with the same respondents two years later were conducted. The primary outcome was the change in the percentage of people who practiced the recommended levels of PA, analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model to account for clusters at individual and community levels. Additionally, we examined the dose-response relation of the effect based on the intervention doses in each community. The RE-AIM framework assessed intervention dissemination and implementation. The two-year intervention was implemented in all communities, reaching and involving various groups. The rate of people engaged in PA significantly increased in two years (adjusted change:&#x2009;+&#x2009;8.0 percentage points [95% confidence interval: 6.1, 10.0]). Based on the type of PA, only muscle-strengthening activity showed a significant increase (+&#x2009;11.5% points [9.6, 13.5]), whereas walking (-1.8% points [-3.6, 0.1]) and flexibility activities (+&#x2009;0.3% points [-1.5, 2.0]) did not. The increase in PA in higher-dose areas was not significantly different but slightly larger than that in lower-dose areas (+&#x2009;8.4% points vs.&#x2009;+&#x2009;7.6% points, adjusted difference in change: 0.8% points [-3.8, 5.5]). The scaled-up citywide intervention promoted PA, especially muscle-strengthening activity. Collaboration with diverse organizations in different settings is crucial for multi-faceted interventions and requires balancing uncertainty in its implementation quality and quantity owing to collaborative decision-making.
