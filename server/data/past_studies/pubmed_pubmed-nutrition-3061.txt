Study Title: Advances in body composition and gender differences in susceptibility to frailty syndrome: Role of osteosarcopenic obesity.

Study Summary:
There is general consensus that an improper diet negatively impacts health and that nutrition is a primary tool for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. Unfortunately, the importance of studying body composition, which can reveal early predictors of gender-related diseases, is still not well understood in this context. Currently, individuals are still classified as obese based solely on their body mass index, without considering the amount of fat, its distribution, and the quantity of muscle and bone mass. In this regard, the body composition phenotype defined as "osteosarcopenic obesity" affects approximately 6-41&#xa0;% of postmenopausal women, with prevalence increasing with age due to the hormonal and metabolic changes that occur during this period. This particular phenotype arises from the strong relationship between visceral fat, muscle, bone, and gut microbiota and predispose postmenopausal women to frailty. Frailty is a complex clinical phenomenon with significant care and economic implications for our society. Recent studies suggest that women have a higher prevalence of frailty syndrome and its individual components, such as osteoporosis, fractures and sarcopenia, compared to men. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances regarding the impact of gender on body composition and frailty. Furthermore, we reflect on the crucial importance of personalized nutritional interventions, with a focus on reducing visceral fat, increasing protein intake and optimizing vitamin D levels. A review of the scientific literature on this topic highlights the importance of studying body composition for a personalized and gender-specific approach to nutrition and dietetics, in order to identify frailty syndrome early and establish personalized treatments. This new method of researching disease predictors could likely help clarify the controversial results of studies on vitamin D, calcium and proteins, translate into practical wellness promotion across diverse elderly populations.
