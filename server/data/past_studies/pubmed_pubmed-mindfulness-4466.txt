Study Title: The Effects of Tele-Yoga in Ankylosing Spondylitis Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled trial aimed at investigating the effects of tele-yoga on physical function, disease activity, spinal mobility, flexibility, muscular endurance, exercise capacity, balance, sleep quality, stress, depression, anxiety, quality of life (QoL), and mindfulness in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).Sixty patients with AS were randomly assigned to the tele-yoga group (TYG) or wait-list control group (CG). In addition to their medical treatments, TYG participants attended online yoga classes three times per week for 8 weeks. The CG continued their standard medical treatment. Data were collected at baseline and after 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was physical function as assessed by the Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI). Secondary outcome measures included the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Patient Global Score (BAS-G), Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society Health Index (ASAS HI), Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI), sit-and-reach test, sit-up test, push-up test, incremental shuttle walk test, Balance Master test, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS).Compared with the CG (&#x2009;=&#x2009;27), participants in the TYG (&#x2009;=&#x2009;28) demonstrated significant improvements in BASFI (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). The TYG also showed significant improvements in disease activity, spinal mobility, flexibility, muscular endurance, balance, sleep quality, stress, depression, and QoL compared with the CG (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05).Tele-yoga practice appears to be a safe and promising intervention for patients with AS and should be considered as a part of holistic disease management because of its potential physical and psychological benefits.NCT04803383.
