Study Title: Enhanced vasoconstriction in sickle cell disease is dependent on ETA receptor activation.

Study Summary:
Sickle cell disease (SCD) carries a significant risk for poor vascular health and vascular dysfunction. High levels of vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as elevated plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor with actions via the ETA receptor, are both common phenotypes in SCD. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activation is a major mediator of stress-induced vasoconstriction. However, the mechanism of the SCD enhanced vasoconstrictive response is unknown. We hypothesized that SCD induces enhanced alpha-1 adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction through the ET-1/ETA receptor pathway in arterial tissues. Utilizing humanized SCD (HbSS) and genetic control (HbAA) mice, alpha-1a, but not alpha-1b or alpha-1d, receptor expression was significantly greater in aortic tissue from HbSS mice compared to HbAA mice. Significantly enhanced vasoconstriction in aortic and carotid arterial segments were observed from HbSS mice compared with HbAA mice. Treatment with ambrisentan, a selective ETA receptor antagonist, and a ROS scavenger normalized the aortic vasoconstrictive response in HbSS mice. In a randomized translational study, patients with SCD were treated with placebo or ambrisentan for 3 months, with the treatment group showing an increase in the percent brachial arterial diameter. Taken together, these data suggest that the ETA receptor pathway interaction with the adrenergic receptor pathway contributes to enhanced aortic vasoconstriction in SCD. Findings indicate the potential of ETA antagonism as a therapeutic avenue for improving vascular health in SCD.
