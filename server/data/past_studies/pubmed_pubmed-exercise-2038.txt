Study Title: Sportizumab - Multimodal progressive exercise over 10&#xa0;weeks decreases Th17 frequency and CD49d expression on CD8T cells in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) represents a neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by the predominance of circulating T cell subsets with proinflammatory characteristics and increased central nervous system (CNS)-homing potential. Substantial evidence confirms various beneficial effects of chronic exercise interventions in MS, but it is unknown how long-term multi-modal intense exercise affects MS-associated lymphocytes that are commonly targeted by medication in persons with relapsing remitting MS (pwRRMS). A total of 45 participants with defined RRMS were randomized to either the exercise (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;22) or passive waitlist-control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;23). A 10-week intervention consisting of progressive resistance and strength-endurance exercises was applied (3x/week &#xe0; 60&#xa0;min). Blood was drawn before (T) and after (T) the intervention period. Flow cytometry was used for phenotyping lymphocyte subsets. Relative protein expression of CD49d within CD8T cells, quantified via mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), is significantly associated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.440), decreased in the exercise group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001) only, and was significantly lower in the exercise compared to the control group at T(p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). T helper (Th) 17 cell frequency decreased only in the exercise group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). CD8CD20T cell frequency was significantly lower in the exercise compared to the control group at T(p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003), without showing significant time effects. The 10-week multimodal exercise intervention mainly affected circulating T cells harboring a pathophysiological phenotype in MS. The findings of a decreased frequency of pathogenic Th17 cells and the reduced CNS-homing potential of CD8T cells, indicated by reduced CD49d MFI, substantiate the positive effects of exercise on cellular biomarkers involved in disease activity and progression in MS. To confirm exercise-mediated beneficial effects on both disease domains, clinical endpoints (i.e., relapse rate, lesion formation, EDSS score) should be assessed together with these cellular and molecular markers in studies with a larger sample size and a duration of six to twelve months or longer.
