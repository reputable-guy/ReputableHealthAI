Study Title: Mindfulness Applications: Can They Serve as a Stress, Anxiety, and Burnout Reduction Tool in Orthopaedic Surgery Training? A Randomized Control Trial.

Study Summary:
Stress and burnout are prevalent within the orthopaedic surgery community. Mindfulness techniques have been shown to improve wellness, yet traditional courses are generally time-intensive with low surgeon utilization. We sought to determine whether the introduction of a simple mindfulness-based phone application would help decrease stress, anxiety, and burnout in orthopaedic surgery residents. Twenty-four residents participated in this prospective, randomized controlled trial. After simple 1:1 randomization, the treatment group received access to a mindfulness-based phone application for 2 months while the control group did not receive access. All participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Maslach Burnout Inventory with emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment subscores to measure stress, anxiety, and burnout at baseline and after 2 months. Pairedtests were used to compare baseline scores and conclusion scores for both groups. There was no difference in baseline burnout scores between groups, but the treatment group had higher stress and anxiety scores at baseline. On average, the treatment group spent approximately 8 minutes per day, 2 days per week using the mindfulness application. After 2 months, the treatment group had significantly decreased stress (mean = -7.42, p = 0.002), anxiety (mean = -6.16, p = 0.01), EE (mean = -10.83 &#xb1; 10.72, p = 0.005), and DP (mean = -5.17 &#xb1; 5.51, p = 0.01). The control group did not have any significant differences in stress, anxiety, or burnout subscores. Use of a mindfulness-based phone app for 2 months led to significant reductions in stress, anxiety, and burnout scores in orthopaedic surgery residents. Our results support the use of a mindfulness-based app to help decrease orthopaedic resident stress, anxiety, and burnout. Benefits were seen with only modest use, suggesting that intensive mindfulness training programs may not be necessary to effect a change in well-being. The higher baseline stress and anxiety in the treatment group may suggest that mindfulness techniques are particularly effective in those who perceive residency to be more stressful. I.
