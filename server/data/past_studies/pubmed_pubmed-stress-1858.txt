Study Title: Association of prediabetes with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome: a post hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials.

Study Summary:
There is conflicting evidence whether prediabetes is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. We aimed to assess the effect of prediabetes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome on clinical outcomes. This is a secondary analysis of data from the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials, including patients with chronic coronary syndrome determined by coronary computed tomography angiography or exercise-stress testing. Participants were assigned to the normoglycemia group (HbA1c&#x2009;<&#x2009;5.7% [<&#x2009;39&#xa0;mmol/mol]), prediabetes group (HbA1c 5.7-6.4% [40-47&#xa0;mmol/mol]), or diabetes group (HbA1c&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;6.5% [&#x2265;&#x2009;48&#xa0;mmol/mol]). The primary end point of this study was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiovascular events and composites thereof. Overall, the primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 330 (8.4%) of 3910 patients over a median follow-up time of 3.1&#xa0;years (IQR 2.1-4.1). The primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 37 (5.2%) of 716 patients in the normoglycemia group, in 63 (6.9%) of 911 in the prediabetes group, and in 230 (10.1%) of 2283 in the diabetes group. In the covariate-adjusted Cox model analysis, the estimated adjusted HR (aHR) in the prediabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.45 (95%CI, 0.95-2.20). The aHR in the diabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.84 (95%CI, 1.29-2.65). Prediabetes, compared with normoglycemia, was associated with an increased risk of stroke (aHR, 3.44, 95%CI, 1.15-10.25). Subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of all-cause death associated with prediabetes in males and patients under 65&#xa0;years. In patients with chronic coronary syndrome, diabetes but not prediabetes was associated with significantly increased risk of all-cause death within a median follow-up period of 3.1&#xa0;years. Trial Registration NCT01471522, BioLINCC ID 13936.
