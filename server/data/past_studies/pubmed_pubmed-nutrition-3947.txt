Study Title: Disciplined appetites: Reimagining food and nutrition programs for people living with HIV and AIDS.

Study Summary:
Medical nutrition therapy is recommended for people living with HIV/AIDS to improve health and wellness; however, there is a lack of food and nutrition programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in Nova Scotia, Canada. The aim of this study was to explore the beliefs, values, and experiences of people living with HIV/AIDS in relation to food and nutrition programs. A critical social theory lens with two disciplinary contexts: critical health geography and critical dietetics guided this research. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 people living with HIV/AIDS and analysed for themes. The three main themes were identified: (1) intersections of social determinants of health, wellness, and food security; (2) discursive shaping of food and nutrition in relation to HIV; and (3) the dynamic nature of HIV care. Participants offered recommendations on how food and nutrition programs might be reimagined to be more accessible, inclusive, and effective for people living with HIV/AIDS.
