Study Title: Comprehensive corrective exercise program improves ankle function in female athletes with limited weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Limited ankle dorsiflexion range of motion is one of the most important risk factors for lower limb injury, which changes the biomechanics and the neuromuscular control of the lower limb muscles. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive corrective exercise program (CCEP) on the range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation in female athletes with limited weight-bearing lunge ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. 30 female athletes aged 15 to 25 years with dorsiflexion under 34&#xb0; were randomized to two groups. The intervention group (n = 15) received eight weeks of CCEP including soft tissue mobilization, joint mobilization, stretching, and strengthening, and the control (n = 15) group did not receive any intervention. range of motion, proprioception, dynamic balance, and muscle activation were assessed before and after the intervention. The training group showed clinically acceptable and statistically significant changes in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ES = 0.714), balance (ES = 0.423), and proprioception (ES = 0.253; P < 0.05). There were significant changes in the activity of the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles in the dynamic overhead squat test (descending and ascending phases) and the activity of the medial gastrocnemius in the descending phase decreased significantly (P < 0.05). No significant change was observed in the activity of the peroneus longus muscle (P > 0.05). The findings show that CCEP appears to be beneficial in increasing dorsiflexion range of motion, proprioception, balance, and decreasing ankle muscle activity among individuals with limited ankle dorsiflexion. Improving the dorsiflexion range of motion may be promising for reducing ankle sprain injury.
