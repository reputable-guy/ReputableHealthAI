Study Title: Is Mat pilates effective in lower limb strength and hand grip strength of people with Parkinson's? A randomized clinical trial with follow-up.

Study Summary:
Parkinson's disease can contribute to the loss of muscle strength, and physical exercise such as Mat Pilates can be effective in improving this, core stability, flexibility, and muscle control. To analyze the effects of a 12-week intervention with Mat Pilates in the short and long term, on lower limb and hand grip strength in people with Parkinson's. The study included 23 people (61.7&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7.5 years) of both sexes, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who were selected according to inclusion criteria and divided into intervention and control groups. The hand grip variable showed improvement in the intervention group intragroup only in the right hand (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003) in the post-intervention period. In the lower limb strength variable, there was significance in the extension of the left leg both in the intervention intragroup (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.042), and in the control group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001) the result in the flexion of the left leg in the intervention group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.032). The follow-up data showed significance in the strength of extension of the right leg in the intervention group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.049) and in the control group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024) and in the extension of the left leg in the intervention group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.021). Mat Pilates classes for people with Parkinson's with mild and moderate degrees proved to be effective in the short term in the hand grip strength of the right hand, and in the extension and flexion of the left legs, and positive effects in the long term in the strength of extension of the right also left legs.
