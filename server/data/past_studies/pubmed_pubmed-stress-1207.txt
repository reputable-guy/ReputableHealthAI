Study Title: Comparative and combination study of simvastatin alone and in combination with Beta vulgaris in hyperlipidemia patients.

Study Summary:
Phytomedicine is gaining acceptance as well preference in health care management for various diseases. Drug combinations are mostly used clinically for hyperlipidemia, as single-agent therapy is insufficient. Statins remain the cornerstone of hyperlipidemia. The objective of the present research is to manage hyperlipidemia with the least amount of medicine effective clinically, thereby limiting its side effects. Study was carried out with 140 registered hyperlipidemia patients, divided into two groups. Group-A received simvastatin 20mg oral daily & Group B received a combination of simvastatin and beta-valgaris capsules twice a day for 90 days. Pre and post treatment values were compared within the groups and between the groups. Group B shows statistically significant decrease (p<0.05) in serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and CRP levels. Also significant improvement (p<0.05) was noted for high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (20.1% to 57.4%) in group B after completion of study. On the basis of our study results, we can conclude that statins remained to be the mainstay treatment for patients with elevated cholesterol levels. However, the combination has a synergistic effect and reduces oxidative stress (OS) as well.
