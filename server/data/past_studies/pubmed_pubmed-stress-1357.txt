Study Title: A guided single session intervention to reduce intrusive memories of work-related trauma: a randomised controlled trial with healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Study Summary:
Intrusive memories of psychologically traumatic events bring distress both sub-clinically and clinically. This parallel-group, two-arm randomised controlled trial evaluated the effect of a brief behavioural intervention on reducing intrusive memories in frontline healthcare workers exposed to traumatic events during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants with at least two intrusive memories of work-related trauma in the week before recruitment were randomised 1:1 to an imagery-competing task intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;73) or attention-based control task (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;71). The number of intrusive memories was assessed at baseline and 5&#xa0;weeks after the guided session (primary endpoint). The intervention significantly reduced intrusive memory frequency compared with control [intervention Mdn&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0 (IQR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0-3), control Mdn&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.0 (IQR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1-17); p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001, IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.30; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.17-0.53] and led to fewer post-traumatic stress-related symptoms at 1, 3 and 6&#xa0;month follow-ups (secondary endpoints). Participants and statisticians were blinded to allocation. Adverse events data were acquired throughout the trial, demonstrating safety. There was high adherence and low attrition. This brief, single-symptom, repeatable digital intervention for subclinical-to-clinical samples after trauma allows scalability, taking a preventing-to-treating approach after trauma. 2020-07-06, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04460014.
