Study Title: Impact of CYP1A2 Genotypes on the Ergogenic Effects and Subjective Mood States of Caffeine Ingestion in Resistance-Trained Women.

Study Summary:
Caffeine's metabolism is determined by CYP1A2 genotypes: AC/CC (SLOW) and AA (FAST). This trial evaluated CYP1A2 genotypes' impact on exercise and cognitive effects in 36 resistance-trained females assessed under placebo (PL) and caffeine (6 mg/kg bw anhydrous caffeine-CAF) conditions, before ingestion and throughout the session. 23andMe(San Francisco, CA, USA) determined genotypes using saliva. Data were analyzed using two-way RMANOVA and paired-samples-tests (< 0.05). A significant main effect for genotype existed for leg press repetitions to failure (RTF) for CAF (= 0.038), with the FAST group performing more repetitions than the SLOW (= 0.027). There was a significant condition x genotype interaction for the subjective outcome index score (= 0.045), with significant differences for time (< 0.01) and between genotype (< 0.001). Follow-up analysis revealed a higher total score (= 0.028) following CAF for the FAST group and a lower total score (< 0.01) in the SLOW group. Dizziness was reported following CAF in the SLOW group (= 0.014; Cohen's= 0.725). Aside from leg press RTF, subjective outcome index score, and dizziness, the genotype groups experienced similar responses to resistance exercise performance and subjective mood states following caffeine ingestion.
