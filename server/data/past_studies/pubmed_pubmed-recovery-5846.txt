Study Title: The efficacy and safety of leucine-enriched essential amino acids in knee osteoarthritis patients: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Supplementation with leucine-enriched essential amino acids (LEAAs) has shown efficacy in the recovery of muscle injury and activation of muscle synthesis. Muscle function in knee osteoarthritis is a crucial factor for managing pain and preserving ambulatory function. However, the efficacy and safety of LEAAs supplementation in patients with knee osteoarthritis have not been evaluated. In this prospective analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of supplementation with 12&#x2009;g of LEAAs daily for 8 weeks in knee-symptomatic osteoarthritis patients. For assessing the efficacy, clinical pain, calf circumference, and disability were assessed using questionnaires (visual analog scale, Knee Society Score, and 36-item short form survey [SF-36]), laboratory analyses (total protein and albumin), and radiologic study (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) for muscle and bone density. To evaluate safety, generalized or localized protein allergic reactions, complete blood count, liver and kidney function, and serum glucose were measured. Sixty-five participants, categorized into the experimental (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;32) and control (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;33) groups, were included in this 8-week trial from March 2022 to July 2022. A significantly higher efficacy was observed in the experimental group than in the control group, as indicated by muscle density in the DEXA scan (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.001) and SF-36 (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001). The safety evaluation revealed no related generalized or local protein allergy. Hematological findings, serum glucose, and kidney and liver toxicity were not significantly different between the groups. Supplementation with leucine-enriched proteins is safe and efficacious in the improvement of muscle density and quality of life.
