Study Title: Impact of Intensive Care Unit Critical Care Management on Patients Diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

Study Summary:
To investigate the impact of critical care management on patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during their stay in intensive care units (ICU). A total of 62 ARDS patients admitted to the ICU of our hospital between March 2020 and March 2023 were enrolled as research participants. The patients were randomly assigned to either the research group (n=31) receiving critical care management or the control group (n=31) receiving routine care. Key parameters, including the duration of ICU stay, mean hospital length of stay (HLOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), were recorded. Additionally, changes in the Self-rating Anxiety/Depression Scale (SAS/SDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE), and Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) were assessed before and after the intervention. A self-designed questionnaire was employed to evaluate nursing quality and patient satisfaction. In comparison to the control group, the research group exhibited significantly shorter durations of ICU stay, mean HLOS, and mechanical ventilation, along with a reduced incidence of VAP (P < .05). Moreover, the SAS, SDS, PSQI, APACHE II, and CPIS scores in the research group were lower than those in the control group, while the quality of care and satisfaction scores were notably higher (P < .05). ICU critical care management demonstrates the potential to enhance the rehabilitation of ARDS patients and decrease the incidence of VAP, suggesting its clinical applicability.
