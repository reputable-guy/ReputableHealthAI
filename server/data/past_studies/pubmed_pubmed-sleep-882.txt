Study Title: Neural complexity is increased after low doses of LSD, but not moderate to high doses of oral THC or methamphetamine.

Study Summary:
Neural complexity correlates with one's level of consciousness. During coma, anesthesia, and sleep, complexity is reduced. During altered states, including after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), complexity is increased. In the present analysis, we examined whether low doses of LSD (13 and 26&#x2009;&#xb5;g) were sufficient to increase neural complexity in the absence of altered states of consciousness. In addition, neural complexity was assessed after doses of two other drugs that significantly altered consciousness and mood: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 7.5 and 15&#x2009;mg) and methamphetamine (MA; 10 and 20&#x2009;mg). In three separate studies (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;73; 21, LSD; 23, THC; 29, MA), healthy volunteers received placebo or drug in a within-subjects design over three laboratory visits. During anticipated peak drug effects, resting state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded Limpel-Ziv complexity and spectral power. LSD, but not THC or MA, dose-dependently increased neural complexity. LSD also reduced delta and theta power. THC reduced, and MA increased, alpha power, primarily in frontal regions. Neural complexity was not associated with any subjective drug effect; however, LSD-induced reductions in delta and theta were associated with elation, and THC-induced reductions in alpha were associated with altered states. These data inform relationships between neural complexity, spectral power, and subjective states, demonstrating that increased neural complexity is not necessary or sufficient for altered states of consciousness. Future studies should address whether greater complexity after low doses of LSD is related to cognitive, behavioral, or therapeutic outcomes, and further examine the role of alpha desynchronization in mediating altered states of consciousness.
