Study Title: The Impact of Flavonoid Supplementation on Serum Oxidative Stress Levels Measured via D-ROMs Test in the General Population: The PREVES-FLAVON Retrospective Observational Study.

Study Summary:
Oxidative stress has emerged as a key contributor to numerous NCDs (non-communicable diseases), including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. This study aims to explore the potential of targeted interventions to mitigate oxidative stress as part of a primary prevention strategy. The study included 32 healthy participants (11 men, 21 women) aged 45-65 who completed both the initial and follow-up assessments of the Healthy Days Initiative, a community-based wellness program organized by the non-profit Associazione O.R.A. ETS. Through blood analysis, vital sign assessment, lifestyle questionnaires, and individualized recommendations, participants received guidance on improving their health and reducing disease risk. The initiative also offered the opportunity for participants to consume a flavonoid supplement containing quercitrin, rutin, and hesperidin, with the goal of reducing oxidative stress. Participants who opted for supplementation were instructed to take 1-2 tablets daily for two weeks. Data collected included demographic information, anthropometric measurements, vital signs, dietary and lifestyle habits, medical history, WHO-5 Well-Being Index scores, and blood parameters. Significant reductions were observed in glucose levels (from 82 to 74.5 mg/dL), reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) (from 394.5 to 365.5 U.CARR), and systolic blood pressure (from 133 to 122 mmHg) after the two-week flavonoid intervention. Most participants (26/31) reported no side effects, and the majority (30/31) expressed a willingness to continue using a product combination of quercitrin, rutin, and hesperidin or a similar product long-term. While limited in scope and duration, the PREVES-FLAVON study contributes valuable insights to the growing body of evidence suggesting that flavonoid supplementation may play a significant role in reducing risk factors associated with NCDs in primary prevention settings. By targeting novel risk factors such as oxidative stress, this intervention holds promise for mitigating the global burden of NCDs and promoting healthy aging.
