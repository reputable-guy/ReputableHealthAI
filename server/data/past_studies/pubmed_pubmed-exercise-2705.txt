Study Title: Breaking up Sitting Time With Isometric Wall Squat Exercise During Occupational Activities: A Feasibility Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of to analyze the feasibility of isometric wall squat exercise (IWSE) over a 12-week period as a method of breaking up sitting time during occupational activities in sedentary adults. This feasibility randomized study involved sedentary adults. Participants in the IWSE group ( n = 12) performed isometric wall squats, while participants in the STAND group ( n = 12) were recommended to stand up for 12 weeks. Feasibility was assessed through online questionnaires in the eighth week regarding adherence, safety, satisfaction, and acceptability. Adherence to weekly breaks was similar between groups ( P > 0.05). No serious side effects have been reported in the groups. Dropout rates (IWSE: 40% vs STAND: 40%, P = 1.000), satisfaction (IWSE +3.4 [1.2] vs STAND +3.0 [1.7], P = 0.709), and intention to continue with the intervention (IWSE: 75% vs STAND: 83%, P = 0.368) were similar between groups. The IWSE is as feasible as stand up as a strategy to breaking up sedentary time in workplace.
