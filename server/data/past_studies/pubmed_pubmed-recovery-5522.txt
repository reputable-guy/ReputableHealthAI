Study Title: Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness Following Acute Resistance Exercise in Untrained Females: A Comparative Study Between Vegans and Omnivores.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to assess the levels of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) markers in individuals adhering to vegan and omnivore diets after engaging in acute resistance exercise. A total of 54 untrained young, healthy, normal-body-weight women (age: 26.8&#xb1;4.1 years; body mass index: 22.5&#xb1;2.7&#x2009;kg/m) participated in the study. Participants were categorized into two groups: vegans (n=27) and omnivores (n=27) based on their dietary preferences, with all subjects having adhered to their respective diets for a minimum of 2 years. DOMS was induced by a single eccentric resistance exercise session, comprising four exercises (leg press, chest press, leg curls, and arm curls), each consisting of four sets of 10 repetitions. Various measurements, including dietary factors, state of wellness, body composition, muscle circumferences, muscle pressure point thresholds (PPTs), and muscle strength, were recorded both before and 48&#x2009;hours after the exercise session. The results showed that wellness and muscle circumferences remained unchanged or displayed similar changes between the vegan and omnivore groups following acute resistance exercise. However, notable differences were observed in PPTs in favor of vegans, specifically for the right biceps (95% CI: 1.4 to 10.2; p=0.01), the left vastus medialis (95% CI: 0.5 to 6.4; p=0.02), and the right vastus lateralis (95% CI: 3.2 to 12.1; p=0.001). Furthermore, significant differences in right grip strength were found in favor of vegans after the exercise session (95% CI: 3.1 to 26.2; p=0.01). In conclusion, our findings suggest that vegans may experience more favorable changes in DOMS levels following acute resistance exercise in comparison to omnivores. This discrepancy in DOMS markers may indicate enhanced muscle recovery in vegans.
