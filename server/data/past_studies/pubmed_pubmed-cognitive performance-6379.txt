Study Title: Omega-3 fatty acid, carotenoid and vitamin E supplementation improves working memory in older adults: A randomised clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Accumulating evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids (&#x3c9;-3FAs), carotenoids and vitamin E can improve cognitive performance. However, their collective impact on cognition has not yet been investigated in healthy individuals. This study investigated the combined effect of &#x3c9;-3FA, carotenoid and vitamin E supplementation on the cognitive performance of older adults. Cognitively healthy individuals aged &#x2265;65 years consumed daily 1&#xa0;g fish oil (of which 430&#xa0;mg docosahexaenoic acid, 90&#xa0;mg eicosapentaenoic acid), 22&#xa0;mg carotenoids (10&#xa0;mg lutein, 10&#xa0;mg meso-zeaxanthin, 2&#xa0;mg zeaxanthin) and 15&#xa0;mg vitamin E or placebo for 24 months in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial. Following 24-month supplementation, individuals in the active group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30; aged 69.03&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.41 years; 56.7% female) recorded significantly fewer errors in working memory tasks than individuals receiving placebo (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30; aged 69.77&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.74 years; 70% female) (point estimate effect sizes ranged 0.090-0.105). Interestingly, as the cognitive load of the working memory tasks increased, the active group outperformed the placebo group. Statistically significant improvements in tissue carotenoid concentrations, serum xanthophyll carotenoid concentrations and plasma &#x3c9;-3FA concentrations were also observed in the active group versus placebo (point estimate effect sizes ranged 0.078-0.589). Moreover, the magnitude of change of carotenoid concentrations in tissue, and &#x3c9;-3FA and carotenoid concentrations in blood were related to the magnitude of change in working memory performance. These results support a biologically plausible rationale whereby these nutrients work synergistically, and in a dose-dependent manner, to improve working memory in cognitively healthy older adults. Increasing nutritional intake of carotenoids and &#x3c9;-3FAs may prove beneficial in reducing cognitive decline and dementia risk in later life.
