Study Title: Volleyball training improves working memory in children aged 7 to 12 years old: an fNIRS study.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 12-wk extracurricular volleyball training on working memory from both behavioral and cerebral aspects. A total of 80 children were randomized assigned to (i) the experimental group, who engaged in extracurricular volleyball training for 60 min, thrice a week for 12 wk, and (ii) the control group, who maintained their regular daily routine. Working memory was evaluated in both groups using the N-back task before and after the intervention. Furthermore, functional near-infrared spectroscopy was employed to monitor the level of oxygenated hemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex. The experimental group performed better in the behavioral task than the control group, as evidenced by a shorter response time and a higher correct rate. The functional near-infrared spectroscopy results suggested that the activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. In addition, correlation analyses showed that the enhancement of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation was significantly correlated with decreasing response time and improving response accuracy in the N-back task. These findings suggest that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is likely the neural substrate for improved working memory performance elicited by 12-wk open skill exercise.
