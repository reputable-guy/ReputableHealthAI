Study Title: Efficacy ofsubsp.LY-66 andPL-02 in Enhancing Explosive Strength and Endurance: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Probiotics are posited to enhance exercise performance by influencing muscle protein synthesis, augmenting glycogen storage, and reducing inflammation. This double-blind study randomized 88 participants to receive a six-week intervention with either a placebo,subsp.LY-66,PL-02, or a combination of both strains, combined with a structured exercise training program. We assessed changes in maximal oxygen consumption (VO), exercise performance, and gut microbiota composition before and after the intervention. Further analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of probiotics on exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), muscle integrity, and inflammatory markers in the blood, 24 and 48 h post-intervention. The results demonstrated that all probiotic groups exhibited significant enhancements in exercise performance and attenuation of muscle strength decline post-exercise exhaustion (< 0.05). Notably, PL-02 intake significantly increased muscle mass, whereas LY-66 and the combination therapy significantly reduced body fat percentage (< 0.05). Analysis of intestinal microbiota revealed an increase in beneficial bacteria, especially a significant rise infollowing supplementation with PL-02 and LY-66 (< 0.05). Overall, the combination of exercise training and supplementation with PL-02, LY-66, and their combination improved muscle strength, explosiveness, and endurance performance, and had beneficial effects on body composition and gastrointestinal health, as evidenced by data obtained from non-athlete participants.
