Study Title: Mindfulness Effects on Anxiety: Disentangling the Role of Decentering and Treatment Expectations.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness interventions have been found to lower anxiety. However, the current literature has not adequately considered the role of its individual components and of placebo effects. In an online experiment using a balanced placebo design, we aimed to disentangle effects of decentering, a key component of mindfulness, and expectations, a key component of placebo effects, on anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred twenty-eight adults were randomly assigned to one of four groups: placebo/mindful decentering, placebo/sham decentering, sham/mindful decentering, and sham/sham decentering. Instructions were provided using standardized audio instructions. Current anxiety was assessed pre- and postintervention with the Short State version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Mindful decentering was found to reduce anxiety postintervention, as compared to sham decentering, regardless of induced expectations regarding its effectiveness. Participants in the mindful decentering group also mentioned more decentering-related words than those in the sham decentering group. These findings indicate that a short, standardized, and online mindful decentering intervention can effectively decrease pandemic-related anxiety independently of one's expectations. These findings provide insights into the efficacy of the individual elements of mindfulness, highlighting decentering as an effective active component for anxiety relief. Moreover, these findings suggest that, in a nonclinical sample, individuals can apply mindful decentering with minimal training.
