Study Title: Effect of Lifestyle on Reducing Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes among Arab Canadian Muslim Women: A Randomized Control Trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate whether modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be reduced by an intensive healthy lifestyle intervention designed for Arab Muslim women of Middle Eastern descent (AWMD) who are at high risk for this disease. We hypothesized that among Canadian AWMD, the intervention would (a) reduce the identified health risk factors for T2D (body mass index [BMI], &#x2265;30 kg&#xb7;m-2; fasting blood glucose [FBG], &#x2265;5.6 mmol&#xb7;L-1; and waist circumference [WC], &#x2265;80 cm); (b) improve anthropometric measurements; (c) improve lifestyle factors (physical activity level [steps per day] and dietary habits); and (d) improve cardiovascular fitness and reduce blood pressure. After informed consent, 60 participants were randomized to either an exercise and nutrition group (ENG; n = 30) or a control group (CON; n = 30). ENG attended a women-only supervised exercise program that presented Arabic music and traditional Lebanese Dabka three times a week in a Mosque gym for 12 wk. A nutritionist was available 1 h&#xb7;wk-1 for nutrition education. The CON followed their typical day. ENG and CON had similar increased risk profiles for diabetes at baseline. Large significant pre/posttreatment interaction effects were found for BMI, FBG, and WC with a reduced diabetes risk for ENG compared with CON for BMI (1,58) = 1184.8, P < 0.001), FBG (1,58) = 187.7, P < 0.001), and WC (1,58) = 326.4, P < 0.001). The ENG had significantly more participants reach postintervention target values (BMI: &#x3c7;2(1) = 16.48, P = 0.001; FBG: &#x3c7;2(1) = 52.26, P < 0.001; WC: &#x3c7;2(1) = 4.29, P = 0.038) compared with the CON. Adherence to the program was 100%. Modifiable risk factors for T2D were reduced by using a culturally sensitive intervention program with high adherence through weight loss, regular exercise, and nutrition education.
