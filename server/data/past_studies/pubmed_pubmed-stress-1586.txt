Study Title: Effect of white noise during nasal continuous positive airway pressure application on newborn's pain and stress levels, physiological parameters, and crying durations: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
The study was conducted to determine the effects of white noise during nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) application on the newborn's pain and stress levels, physiological parameters, and crying durations. The study used a randomized, controlled experimental design. The study was completed with 80 newborns (40 in the intervention group and 40 in the control group). The Newborn Descriptive Data Form, ALPS Newborn Pain and Stress Assessment Scale, and Follow-up Form were used to collect the study data. Routine nasal CPAP application was performed to newborns in the control group. White noise was played to newborns in the intervention group before, during, and after the nasal CPAP application. The study was approved by an ethics committee. It was found that the newborn's pain and stress levels of the intervention group were lower than the control group before, during, and after the nasal CPAP application (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Before nasal CPAP application, the intervention group's SpO2 average was lower than that of the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). During nasal CPAP application, the intervention group's heart rate, SpO2, and crying duration averages were found to be lower than the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). After nasal CPAP application, the intervention group's crying duration average was lower than the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). It was found that white noise before, during, and after the nasal CPAP application reduced newborns' pain and stress levels. It is recommended that white noise be used as an easily applicable, economical, safe, and non-pharmacological method to reduce the pain and stress caused by nasal CPAP application in newborns. The study was registered at Clinical-Trials.gov (NCT05440669).
