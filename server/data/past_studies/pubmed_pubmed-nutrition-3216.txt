Study Title: Randomized 20-year infancy-onset dietary intervention, life-long cardiovascular risk factors and retinal microvasculature.

Study Summary:
Retinal microvasculature characteristics predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study investigated associations of lifelong cardiovascular risk factors and effects of dietary intervention on retinal microvasculature in young adulthood. The cohort is derived from the longitudinal Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project study. The Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project is a 20-year infancy-onset randomized controlled dietary intervention study with frequent study visits and follow-up extending to age 26 years. The dietary intervention aimed at a heart-healthy diet. Fundus photographs were taken at the 26-year follow-up, and microvascular measures [arteriolar and venular diameters, tortuosity (simple and curvature) and fractal dimensions] were derived (n = 486). Cumulative exposure as the area under the curve for cardiovascular risk factors and dietary components was determined for the longest available time period (e.g. from age 7 months to 26 years). The dietary intervention had a favourable effect on retinal microvasculature resulting in less tortuous arterioles and venules and increased arteriolar fractal dimension in the intervention group when compared with the control group. The intervention effects were found even when controlled for the cumulative cardiovascular risk factors. Reduced lifelong cumulative intake of saturated fats, main target of the intervention, was also associated with less tortuous venules. Several lifelong cumulative risk factors were independently associated with the retinal microvascular measures, e.g. cumulative systolic blood pressure with narrower arterioles. Infancy-onset 20-year dietary intervention had favourable effects on the retinal microvasculature in young adulthood. Several lifelong cumulative cardiovascular risk factors were independently associated with retinal microvascular structure.
