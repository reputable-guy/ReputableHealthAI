Study Title: Changes in Prediabetes Status Among Adults During a 6-Month Randomized Placebo-controlled Supplement Trial With Nutrition and Lifestyle Counselling and 6-Month Follow-up.

Study Summary:
In this work, we present an exploratory within-trial analysis of the changing prevalence of prediabetes in response to nutrition and lifestyle counselling provided as part of a randomized placebo-controlled supplement trial with follow-up. We aimed to identify factors associated with changing glycemia status. Participants (n=401) in this clinical trial were adults with a body mass index (BMI) of &#x2265;25 kg/mand prediabetes (defined by the American Diabetes Association as a fasting plasma glucose [FPG] of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L or a glycated hemoglobin [A1C] of 5.7% to 6.4%) within 6 months before trial entry. The trial consisted of a 6-month randomized intervention with 2 dietary supplements and/or placebo. At the same time, all participants received nutrition and lifestyle counselling. This was followed by a 6-month follow-up. Glycemia status was assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. At baseline, 226 participants (56%) met a threshold for prediabetes, including 167 (42%) with elevated FPG and 155 (39%) with elevated A1C. After the 6-month intervention, the prevalence of prediabetes decreased to 46%, driven by a reduction in prevalence of elevated FPG to 29%. The prevalence of prediabetes then increased to 51% after follow-up. Risk of prediabetes was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; p<0.01), BMI (OR, 1.06; p<0.05), and male sex (OR, 1.81; p=0.01). Participants who reverted to normoglycemia had greater weight loss and lower baseline glycemia. Glycemia status can fluctuate over time and improvements can be gained from lifestyle interventions, with certain factors associated with a higher likelihood of reverting to normoglycemia.
