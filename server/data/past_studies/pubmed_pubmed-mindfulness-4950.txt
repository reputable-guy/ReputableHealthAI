Study Title: Impact of yoga in facilitating muscular functioning among asymptomatic male cricket players: Longitudinal randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Cricket is one of the prominent global team sports. With an emergence of Twenty20 tournaments, the physical preparation of elite cricket players has become complex with high match injury incidence. Yoga as a body-mind training is associated with having positive effects on a person's physical and psychological conditions, bringing in better mind-body equilibrium. Evaluating the impact of yoga in facilitating muscular functioning and mindfulness among asymptomatic male cricket players. First-class domestic male cricket players in the age group of 18-35 years were randomized into yoga group n=42 and wait-list control group n=40. Players received the yoga module for five days per week for a duration of six weeks. Primary outcome measures of muscular functioning were core stability, flexibility, range of motion, static balance, dynamic balance and proprioception of the ankle. Assessments were held at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and a follow-up after six months of intervention. A statistical significance with p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001 was observed for most of the variables at T2 and T3. Comparison of the model fit shows a highly significant p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001 difference between the model as compared to the baseline model among most of the variables. This yoga module was appropriate for enhancing muscular functioning variables of this study. Continuous practice of this yoga module can reinforce sustainable benefits for male cricket players.
