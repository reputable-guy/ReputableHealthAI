Study Title: The impact of photobiomodulation on sleep and life quality in hemodialysis patients: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The quality of life (QoL) and sleep quality are closely linked to the physical and psychological health of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, especially those underwent hemodialysis (HD) therapy. This study aims to investigate the impact of 830&#xa0;nm laser treatment on improving QoL and sleep quality in HD patients. Forty ESRD patients participated in this study. 830&#xa0;nm laser was used to radiate on the palm (at dose of 256.10&#xa0;J/cm), ST 36 and KI 1 acupoints (at dose of 109.76&#xa0;J/cm) of HD patients, and QoL and sleep quality questionnaires were utilized to assess changes following the treatment. After 830&#xa0;nm laser radiation, lower global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Athens Insomnia Scale scores were observed, accompanied by higher physical and mental component summary scores in MOS 36-item short-form health survey version 2 and a global World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version score. The laser group also showed significant improvements in QoL and sleep quality indicators. Additionally, pain levels decreased on the third day and after one month according to visual analogue scale. This study revealed the positive effects of 830&#xa0;nm laser on palm, KI 1 and ST 36 acupoints for improving the QoL and sleep quality in ESRD patients underwent HD treatment. The results suggest that 830&#xa0;nm laser applied to specific targets could be used as a complementary and alternative approach to increase the QoL and sleep quality in ESRD patients.
