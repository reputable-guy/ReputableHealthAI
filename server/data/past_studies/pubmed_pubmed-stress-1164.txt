Study Title: Applying an osteopathic intervention to improve mild to moderate mental health symptoms: a mixed-methods feasibility randomised trial.

Study Summary:
The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders in the United Kingdom necessitates the exploration of novel treatment modalities. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of four osteopathic interventions on psychophysiological and mental health outcomes. A mixed-methods feasibility study with an explanatory sequential design was implemented. The quantitative phase involved randomising 42 participants into four intervention groups: (1) high-velocity and articulation techniques (HVAT), (2) soft-tissue massage (STM), (3) craniosacral therapy (CST), and (4) a combination approach. Primary outcome measures encompassed recruitment rate, assessment duration, questionnaire completion, intervention attrition, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included validated assessments of depression, anxiety, stress, psychological flexibility, heart rate variability (HRV), and interoception, administered pre- and post-intervention. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to evaluate pre-post intervention changes. The qualitative phase comprised semi-structured interviews analysed using thematic analysis. The study achieved a recruitment rate of 21 eligible participants per month, with 54.8% of respondents meeting eligibility criteria. All 33 participants who completed the study underwent interventions and assessments within the allocated one-hour timeframe, with full questionnaire completion. The attrition rate was 21%. No adverse events were reported. Qualitative analysis revealed positive participant experiences, with themes highlighting good practitioner communication, intervention accessibility, and increased bodily awareness. Some participants found the questionnaire battery burdensome. Exploratory quantitative analyses showed variations in effects across interventions for heart rate variability, interoceptive accuracy, and mental health measures, but these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. This study provides evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of a larger-scale RCT investigating osteopathic interventions for individuals presenting with mild psychological symptoms. The preliminary findings suggest potential efficacy in improving mental health outcomes, warranting further investigation. Trial registration NCT05674071, registered 06/01/2023.
