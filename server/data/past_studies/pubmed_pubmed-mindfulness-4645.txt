Study Title: Effectiveness of two video-based multicomponent treatments for fibromyalgia: The added value of cognitive restructuring and mindfulness in a three-arm randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of two video-based multicomponent programs (FIBROWALK) and the Multicomponent Physiotherapy Program (MPP) for patients with fibromyalgia (FM) compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) only. We posit that FIBROWALK, due to inclusion of specific psychological ingredients (cognitive restructuring and mindfulness), can produce additional clinical benefits when compared to TAU or MPP alone. A total of 330 patients with FM were recruited and randomly allocated (1:1:1) to TAU only, TAU&#xa0;+&#xa0;FIBROWALK, or TAU&#xa0;+&#xa0;MPP. FIBROWALK and MPP consisted of weekly videos on pain neuroscience education, therapeutic exercise and self-management patient education, but only the FIBROWALK intervention provided cognitive restructuring and mindfulness. Both programs were structurally equivalent. Between-group differences in functional impairment, pain, kinesiophobia, anxious-depressive symptoms and physical functioning were evaluated at post-treatment following Intention-To-Treat and complete-case approaches. Compared to TAU only, individuals in the FIBROWALK arm showed larger improvements in all clinical outcomes; similarly, participants in the MPP program also showed greater improvements in functional impairment, perceived pain, kinesiophobia, depressive symptoms compared to TAU only. The FIBROWALK intervention showed superior effects in improving pain, anxiety and depressive symptoms and physical functioning compared to MPP. This RCT supports the short-term effectiveness of the video-based multicomponent programs FIBROWALK and MPP for FM and provides evidence that cognitive-behavioural and mindfulness-based techniques can be clinically useful in the context of physiotherapeutic multicomponent treatment programs.
