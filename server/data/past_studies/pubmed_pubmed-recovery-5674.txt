Study Title: Adoption of the cardiopulmonary exercise test in the exercise ability and cardiopulmonary function rehabilitation of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to explore the application of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, evaluate its impact on exercise ability and cardiopulmonary function in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and promote the application of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in CAD management. Fifty CHD patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were recruited and randomly enrolled into the control (Ctrl) group and intervention (Int) group. Routine health education and health education combined with RT training were carried out for the two groups. Blood lipid levels and lung function were compared between the two groups after intervention. Cardiac function was evaluated by Doppler ultrasonography, and cardiopulmonary fitness and exercise ability were evaluated by a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were employed to evaluate negative emotions. The 36-item short-form (SF-36) was adopted to evaluate quality of life. Compared with those in the Ctrl group, the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) decreased in the Int group, while the levels of high-density lipoprotein increased (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The quantitative load results showed that compared with the Ctrl group, the heart rate (HR) and self-perceived fatigue degree of the Int group decreased, and the ST segment increased (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Compared with the Ctrl group, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), forced expiratory volume at 1&#xa0;s (FEV), ratio of forced expiratory volume to forced vital volume (FEV/FVC%), and maximum chase volume (MVV) increased in the Int group, while the left ventricular end diastolic diameter and left ventricular end contractile diameter decreased (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The results of the CPET showed that compared with the Ctrl group, minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope, VE/VCO, anaerobic threshold (AT), peak oxygen pulse (VO/HR), oxygen uptake efficiency platform (OUEP), increasing power exercise time (IPEt), HR recovery 1&#xa0;min after exercise, peak load power (Watt), and value metabolic equivalent (Watt) increased in the Int group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Compared with the Ctrl group, the SAS and SDS scores in the Int group decreased (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The results of the quality of life evaluation showed that compared with the Ctrl group, the score of the SF-36 dimensions increased in the Int group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). RT training can reduce postoperative blood lipid and quantitative load levels in CAD patients and improve adverse mood. Furthermore, it can improve patients' cardiopulmonary function, cardiopulmonary fitness, exercise ability, and quality of life.
