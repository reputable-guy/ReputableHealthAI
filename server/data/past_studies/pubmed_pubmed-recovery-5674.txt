Study Title: The Effect of Delayed Photobiomodulation Therapy on Inferior Alveolar Nerve Recovery After Third Molar Removal: A Triple-Blinded Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Third molar removal is the primary reason for inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) damage, with 2% causing persistent neurosensory deficits. This study aimed to investigate how delayed photobiomodulation therapy affects long-lasting neurosensory disturbances.This study was conducted on patients with neurosensory disturbances lasting longer than 6 months. Patients were randomly allocated to the study and control groups, with the study group receiving a low-power diode laser (continuous wavelength of 810 nm, power of 200 mW) on 16 points (30 sec at each) for 12 sessions (2 sessions/week), while the control group received a placebo treatment by switched-off laser probe. Visual analog scale (VAS; ranging from 1 to 5), static light touch, two-point discrimination, direction discrimination, pinprick, and thermal discrimination tests were performed on each visit up to 9 months post-therapy to evaluate the recovery status.Each group comprised 18 participants. The mean time since injury was 8.26 &#xb1; 2.05 and 8.38 &#xb1; 1.98 months for the control and intervention groups, respectively (= 0.81). There was a significant improvement in the intervention group on the static light touch (= 0.041), two-point discrimination (= 0.028), VAS (= 0.031), and pinprick (= 0.014) tests on the 11th session and subsequent visits and also on direction discrimination test on the 12th session (= 0.044) and after that. There was no significant difference in the thermal discrimination tests between the two groups (> 0.05).Photobiomodulation demonstrated potential benefits in resolving persistent neurosensory deficits of the IAN, with noticeable improvements typically observed after around 35 days of treatment initiation (10 sessions).
