Study Title: Mobile app measuring sleep and behaviors: A trial in adolescents with addiction.

Study Summary:
The smartphones generalisation allows the development of attractive "real-life" monitoring tools for care and research enabling the measurement of addictive behaviours and comorbidities such as sleep disorders. The study objective was to assess the interest of a mobile app collecting such information among adolescents with addictive behaviours in order to enhance the availability of behavioural data in consultation. An open label randomised pilot study was held along two parallel arms. The patients randomised to the intervention group (n=18) used a mobile app to provide daily data for 15 days relating to their sleep and their behaviour (addictive behaviours with or without substances). The patients in the control group (n=18) used a paper diary allowing the collection of the same data, only the medium differed. The patients' median age was 16 years [15.0-16.5]. A median of 67% and 10% of the expected information was completed respectively in the intervention and control groups during the 15 days of follow-up and could be used in consultation (P=0.08). The patient's knowledge, attitudes, intentions to change, behaviour change and seeking help related to the use of the diaries appeared higher in the intervention group (20.5/30) than in the control group (11/20). This study described the high patient compliance with the data collection by means of the app. The diary app seems to have been more impactful for patients than the paper diary. This app could represent an important tool to improve the therapeutic alliance and care due to a better knowledge of the behaviours on the part of the clinician but also a better awareness of the patients themselves.
