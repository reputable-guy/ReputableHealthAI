Study Title: The Effect of Depth of Anesthesia on Postoperative Pain in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Patients with obesity are more sensitive to pain and more likely to have acute postoperative pain (APP). Studies have shown that the depth of anesthesia may affect the incidence of APP. The purpose of the study was to look into the connection between APP and depth of anesthesia in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. This is a prospective, double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 90 patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were randomly divided into two groups: the light anesthesia group (Bispectral Index of 50, BIS 50) and the deep anesthesia group (BIS 35). The degree of pain was evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72&#xa0;h after surgery. The use of analgesics, grade of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score were recorded. The VAS scores at rest or coughing at 0, 12, and 24&#xa0;h after surgery in the BIS 35 group were lower than those in the BIS 50 group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Fewer patients in the deep anesthesia group needed analgesia during the recovery period, and patient satisfaction was higher on the 3rd day after surgery (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.015, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.032, respectively). For patients with obesity, maintaining a deeper depth of anesthesia during surgery is beneficial to reduce APP causes less need for additional analgesic drugs, and improves patient satisfaction.
