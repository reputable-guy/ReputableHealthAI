Study Title: Comparative effects of 8-week combined resistance exercise training and alternate-day calorie restriction on soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR) and adipsin in obese men.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the combined effects of resistance exercise training (RET) and alternate-day calorie restriction (ADCR) on body composition, insulin resistance (IR), insulin resistance-related biomarkers (adipokine adipsin and hepatokine soluble EFGR), and weight loss in obese men. The findings revealed that RET&#x2009;+&#x2009;ADCR induced the greatest reductions in body weight, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) compared to RET and ADCR alone (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Additionally, RET&#x2009;+&#x2009;ADCR resulted in the most significant improvements in IR, as measured by HOMA-IR, and in circulating levels of adipsin and soluble EFGR (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). These findings suggest that combining RET and ADCR may be a more effective strategy for improving metabolic health, including body composition, IR, and metabolic tissues' functions, in obese men than either intervention alone.
