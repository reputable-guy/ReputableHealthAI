Study Title: Global challenges need attention now: educating humanity for wellness and sustainability.

Study Summary:
This Editorial sets the stage for 18 papers on the theme,. The special issue consists of a diverse set of papers that complement one another while each contributes in unique ways that will stimulate reflexive practices among the science education community as they ponder how they can contribute to the resolution of global challenges that define our lifetimes. In this Editorial we address priorities for improved science literacy for a worldwide community so that moment-to-moment practices can reduce the world's carbon footprint and reverse global warming and related challenges such as species extinction. We posit that to meet particulars of global challenges facing humanity, science educators need to expand their roles and definitions of science education. Accordingly, in an era of COVID-19, there is an imperative to expand and deepen functional literacy in science and in particular wellness for everyone as part of a necessary education on the birth through death continuum. Our advocacy for the use of authentic inquiry affords learning from research and ensuring that all research participants have opportunities to learn from ongoing research and one another. We expect that all participants will benefit equitably from being involved in research. Participants are educated about what is learned from research in which they are involved, and how that improves their practices. We anticipate that much of what is learned from such research will be enacted in everyday life, thereby affording those with whom they interact to learn by being-with them. Because of the complex, chaotic and dynamic nature of today's world and its associated lifestyles, we address contemplative activities we regard as highly appropriate for doing science in a manner that is restorative and nurturing for ourselves and for the world. Specifically, we examine breathing meditation, meditating to increase blood oxygenation, walking meditation, loving kindness meditation, soft touch energy work and mindfulness. Each of these contemplative activities relates to knowing thyself better and promoting and sustaining wellness and wellbeing. We address self-help in relation to wellness because so many people follow one or two pathways when they become sick, i.e., they rest until their health improves and/or they go to the doctor who may diagnose/prescribe pharmaceuticals or changes in aspects of lifestyle (e.g., diet, more sleep). We provide examples of self-help practices that allow individuals to be autonomous and proactive in avoiding sickness, and directly addressing symptoms if and when necessary. Finally, we examine the potential of using a dialectical approach to teaching, learning and future rethinking of science education and science educators. Grand challenges of the moment demand no less than ongoing research with transformations that catalyze improvements now. We do not have a luxury of waiting for the right time, and the right time to enact sustainable lifestyles is now.
