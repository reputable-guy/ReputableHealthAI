Study Title: Home-Based Shi's Knee Daoyin Exercise for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.

Study Summary:
Shi's Knee Daoyin (SKD) exercise is a treatment derived from Traditional Chinese exercise (TCE) specifically designed for lower limb health care. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to explore the effectiveness of SKD exercise in treating knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Participants were randomized to receive Health Education (HE) or SKD exercise. The primary outcomes were feasibility and safety outcomes, including participant recruitment rate, retention rate, as well as adherence to intervention. The secondary outcomes included Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, the 20-Meter Walk Test (20-MWT) and the 5-times Chair-Stand Test (5-CST). The results indicate that out of 89 individuals invited to participate in the study, 72 were eligible and agreed to participate, resulting in a recruitment rate of 80.9%. All participating patients completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis; no patients dropped out of the study due to adverse events. The secondary outcome measures showed that after twelve weeks of treatment, the VAS score, WOMAC total score, WOMAC pain score, WOMAC stiffness score, and WOMAC function score of patients in the HE group and SKD group all improved, but the improvement was more significant in the SKD group. The 20-MWT of SKD group after treatment was significantly shorter than before treatment (<0.001); There was no significant difference in 20-MWT between the HE group and baseline after treatment. The performance of the two groups of patients improved in 5-CST, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups after treatment (=2.439). This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of home-based SKD exercise intervention in alleviating symptoms in patients with symptomatic KOA, providing valuable information for designing an appropriate randomized controlled study.
