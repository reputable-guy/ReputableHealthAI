Study Title: Effects of Maltodextrin-Fructose Supplementation on Inflammatory Biomarkers and Lipidomic Profile Following Endurance Running: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Cross-Over Trial.

Study Summary:
Managing metabolism for optimal training, performance, and recovery in medium-to-high-level endurance runners involves enhancing energy systems through strategic nutrient intake. Optimal carbohydrate intake before, during, and after endurance running can enhance glycogen stores and maintain optimal blood glucose levels, influencing various physiological responses and adaptations, including transitory post-endurance inflammation. This randomized trial investigates the impact of a high-dose 2:1 maltodextrin-fructose supplementation to medium-to-high-level endurance runners immediately before, during, and after a 15 km run at 90% VOintensity on post-exercise inflammatory stress. We evaluated inflammatory biomarkers and lipidomic profiles before the endurance tests and up to 24 h after. We focused on the effects of high-dose 2:1 maltodextrin-fructose supplementation on white blood cell count, neutrophil number, IL-6, cortisol, and CRP levels, as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids, &#x3c9;-3 index, and AA/EPA ratio. This supplementation significantly reduced inflammatory markers and metabolic stress. Additionally, it may enhance the post-activity increase in blood &#x3c9;-3 fatty acid levels and reduce the increase in &#x3c9;-6 levels, resulting in a lower trend of AA/EPA ratio at 24 h in the treated arm. Adequate carbohydrate supplementation may acutely mitigate inflammation during a one-hour endurance activity of moderate-to-high intensity. These effects could be beneficial for athletes engaging in frequent, high-intensity activities.
