Study Title: Comparison of photobiomodulation with cryotherapy in the immediate postpartum period of parturients with grade I, grade II lacerations and/or episiotomy in reducing perineal and vulvar and edema: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Vaginal delivery has several benefits for the parturient; however, during labor, some injuries, such as lacerations and/or episiotomy, can occur. Perineal pain may occur in the puerperium and can be aggravated in cases of perineal injury during childbirth, potentially impacting the physical and emotional aspects of the parturient. For this reason, it is necessary to use techniques that can relieve pain and edema in the immediate postpartum period, directly influencing recovery. To compare the reduction of pain and improvement in healing using two techniques, namely photobiomodulation and cryotherapy, performed in the immediate postpartum period of up to 12&#xa0;h, in parturients who suffered grade I and II lacerations and/or episiotomy. Data collection was carried out through an evaluation questionnaire. Photobiomodulation was applied using the red and infrared laser from the DMC brand. The EVA and McGill scales were used for pain assessment, and the REEDA scale was used for the evaluation of edema and healing. The techniques were evaluated and applied to 56 patients, with 28 in each group (cryotherapy and LBI). Patients who received photobiomodulation showed superior improvement compared to cryotherapy. In the immediate postpartum period, there was a greater reduction in pain in favor of photobiomodulation (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008); and after 24&#xa0;h, the difference was even more significant (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001).
