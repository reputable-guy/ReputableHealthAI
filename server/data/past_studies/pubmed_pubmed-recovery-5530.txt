Study Title: Preoperative Bilateral External Oblique Intercostal Plus Rectus Sheath Block for Postoperative Pain Management Following Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Noninferior Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has proven efficacy and is an important component of multimodal analgesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The external oblique intercostal (EOI) block can provide a dermatomal sensory blockade of T6 to T10 using an anterior axillary line injection. The bilateral rectus sheath (RS) block can significantly reduce early postoperative pain caused by umbilical or periumbilical incisions. The current study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacies of ultrasound-guided subcostal TAP (UG-TAP) combined with the RS block and ultrasound-guided EOI (UG-EOI) combined with the RS block for LC. Patients were randomly assigned to TAP or EOI group. Patients in TAP group received UG-TAP combined with an RS block. Patients in EOI group received UG-EOI combined with an RS block. The primary outcome was postoperative 24-hour sufentanil consumption. A total of 49 patients were included in the final analysis. The postoperative 24-hour sufentanil consumption in the EOI group was significantly lower than that in the TAP group (9.79&#xb1;10.22 vs. 18.67&#xb1;12.58&#xa0;&#xb5;g; P [noninferiority] <0.01; noninferiority confirmed). Fewer patients in the EOI versus TAP group had a numerical rating score of >3 during motion. Furthermore, the mean postoperative 48-hour sufentanil consumption was lower in the EOI versus TAP group (11.54&#xb1;11.70 vs. 23.04&#xb1;17.10&#xa0;&#xb5;g; P =0.01). The mean postoperative 24-hour Quality of Recovery-15 score was higher in the EOI versus TAP group (135.21&#xb1;4.40 vs. 131.91&#xb1;5.11; P =0.02). These findings suggest that UG-EOI combined with an RS block was superior to UG-TAP combined with an RS block for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing LC.
