Study Title: Efficacy of a Home-Based, Unsupervised Physical Activity Program on Fatigue, Sleep Quality, and Quality of Life in Survivors of Breast Cancer.

Study Summary:
Women with breast cancer (BC) experience symptoms related to fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life (QOL) in the post- treatment period. Oncology nurses need to plan interventions such as physical activity (PA) aimed at reducing the symptoms experienced by patients. The aim of this article is to determine the efficacy of a home-based, unsupervised PA program on fatigue, sleep quality, and QOL in survivors of BC. This study was an experimental study with a prospective control group. Female survivors of BC were randomly assigned to either the home-based, unsupervised PA intervention group or the control group for 12 weeks. Fatigue, sleep quality, and QOL were assessed with questionnaires at baseline and the 12th week. The home-based, unsupervised PA program yielded positive effects on fatigue and QOL among participants. The program did not affect sleep quality.
