Study Title: Effects of Acute and One-Week Supplementation with Montmorency Tart Cherry Powder on Food-Induced Uremic Response and Markers of Health: A Proof-of-Concept Study.

Study Summary:
Metabolic conditions, such as gout, can result from elevated uric acid (UA) levels. Consuming high-purine meals increases UA levels. Therefore, people with hyperuricemia typically must avoid ingesting such foods. Polyphenols have been shown to reduce uric acid levels and tart cherries (TCs) are a rich source of phenolic and anthocyanin compounds. This proof-of-concept study evaluated whether ingesting TCs with a purine-rich meal affects the uricemic response.A total of 25 adults (15 males and 10 females, 85.0 &#xb1; 17 kg, 40.6 &#xb1; 9 years, 29.1 &#xb1; 4.9 kg/m) with elevated fasting UA levels (5.8 &#xb1; 1.3 mg/dL) donated a fasting blood sample. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced manner, participants ingested capsules containing 960 mg of a placebo (PLA) or concentrated TC powder containing 20.7 mg of proanthocyanins with a serving of hot soup (10 g of carbohydrate, 2 g protein, and 1 g fat) containing 3 g of purines (1 g of adenosine 5'-monophosphate, 1 g of disodium 5'-guanylate, and 1 g of disodium 5'-inosinate). Blood samples were obtained at 0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after ingestion to assess changes in uric acid levels and pharmacokinetic profiles. Cell blood counts, a comprehensive metabolic panel, cytokines, inflammatory markers, and subjective side effects ratings were analyzed on baseline (0 min) and post-treatment (240 min) samples. Participants continued consuming two capsules/day of the assigned treatment for one week and then repeated the experiment. Participants observed a 14-day washout and then repeated the experiment while ingesting the alternate treatment. Data were analyzed using general linear model (GLM) statistics with repeated measures, pairwise comparisons, and percentage change from baseline with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).No statistically significant interaction effects or differences between treatments were seen in uric acid levels or PK profiles. Analysis of percent changes from baseline revealed that TC ingestion reduced the blood glucose levels following the ingestion of the high-purine meal (-4.2% [-7.7, -0.7],= 0017). Additionally, there was some evidence that TC ingestion attenuated the increase from baseline in IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-10 and increased INF-&#x3b3;. No significant differences were seen in the remaining health markers or subjective side effects ratings.Acute and one-week TC supplementation did not affect the uricemic response to ingesting a high-purine meal in individuals with mildly elevated UA levels. However, there was some evidence that TC supplementation may blunt the glycemic response to ingesting a meal and influence some inflammatory cytokines. Registered clinical trial NCT04837274.
