Study Title: Family-Based Motivational Interviewing and Resource Mobilization to Prevent Obesity: Living Well Together Trial.

Study Summary:
Test an obesity intervention for families with low incomes. A total of 208 families were included (a parent with a body mass index [BMI] &#x2265; 30 and a child aged 6-12 years). A 12-month randomized controlled trial combining family health coaching (motivational interviewing) and connection to community resources. Comparison group: referrals for basic needs, written educational materials. Questionnaires, accelerometry, and anthropometrics. Intention-to-treat analysis of change in outcomes. Two-sided t test with multiple imputation. Parents were 95% female, 31% Black, and 27% Hispanic. Children had a mean BMI-Z score of 1.15. Primary outcomes did not differ between groups at 12 months. Both groups significantly (P < 0.05) improved on the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Scale for behaviors related to childhood obesity (mean &#xb1; SE: comparison, 2.8 &#xb1; 1.0; intervention, 2.2 &#xb1; 0.9), increased child sedentary activity (comparison, 32.5 &#xb1; 12.1; intervention, 39.9 &#xb1; 12.4 min/d), and decreased child moderate-vigorous physical activity (comparison, -9.6 &#xb1; 3.3; intervention -7.0 &#xb1; 3.0 min/d). Parents had no change in BMI. We successfully embedded screening and referral to address social needs within an obesity intervention. The coaching intervention did not provide additional benefits. Future research could explore ways to make these interventions more accessible, valuable, and effective for families.
