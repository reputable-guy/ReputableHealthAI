Study Title: Evaluating the impact of platelet-rich plasma injection in spinal endoscopic nucleotomy on MRI pfirrmann grading and clinical outcomes in lumbar disc herniation.

Study Summary:
This study investigates the clinical efficacy and safety of percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy combined with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection in treating lumbar disc herniation (LDH) in young and middle-aged adults. From April 2022 to September 2023, 60 patients diagnosed with LDH were randomly divided into two groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30/group). The observation group underwent percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy combined with autologous PRP gel injection into the disc, while the control group underwent percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy alone. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were recorded preoperatively and at three time points postoperatively: three days, three months, and six months. The modified Macnab criteria were employed to evaluate efficacy at the final follow-up. Additionally, MRI Pfirrmann grading of the operated disc segment and potential complications were assessed both preoperatively and at the final follow-up. All patients were followed for a minimum of six months. VAS and ODI scores at all postoperative time points (three days, three months, and six months) exhibited significant differences compared to preoperative scores in both groups (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Notably, a significant difference was observed in VAS and ODI scores between the two groups at three days postoperatively (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Preoperative MRI Pfirrmann grading indicated no significant difference between groups (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.669). However, at the final follow-up, the observation group demonstrated superior recovery compared to the control group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013). The modified Macnab criteria revealed no significant difference in the rates of excellent and good outcomes between the observation group (96.67%) and the control group (93.33%) (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Furthermore, no patients experienced complications such as dural tears, nerve root injury, infection, or hematoma. The combination of percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy and PRP injection could be a safe and effective treatment for LDH in young and middle-aged adults to promote disc repair following endoscopic procedures.
