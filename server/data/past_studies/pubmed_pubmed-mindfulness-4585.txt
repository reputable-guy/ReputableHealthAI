Study Title: Using Photovoice in a Mindfulness-Based Program to Understand the Experiences of Caregivers of Young Adults with Psychosis.

Study Summary:
Studies have consistently shown that family caregivers experience caregiver burden and depression when they provide care for family members with psychosis. Photovoice is a participatory action research method of fostering dialogues about personal experiences by sharing and discussing photographs that may improve our understanding about how a mindfulness-based family psychoeducation program (MBFPE) can reduce the caregiver burden and improve their caregiving experience. We explored the experiences of the participants in their use of photovoice in a MBFPE. We investigated whether the MBFPE program generated positive changes for caregivers of young adults with psychosis. Using photovoice, we collected qualitative data to help develop a unique contextual understanding of MBFPE program outcomes and generate novel ideas, insights, suggestions, and questions on the basis of participant's perceptions. Participants in our pilot study and randomized controlled study of MBFPE were invited to participate in this photovoice activity. On the basis of a procedure developed for MBFPE, caregivers were invited to use photographs to express how mindfulness contributed to caregivers' management of their caregiving stress and burden. Caregiver's inquiry with the MBFPE instructors were transcribed for analysis together with the photographs. A grounded theory approach was adopted to analyze the photovoice images, participants' reflections, and inquiries of photographs. Six themes were developed in understanding the lived experience of caregivers in participation of MBFPE: (1) I pay attention to the present moment; (2) I care about my family; (3) I trust my children; (4) I appreciate the connection with and support from nature and the universe; (5) I observe my worries and guilt and learn not to be reactive; and (6) I find space in offering care and exercising self-care. The application of photovoice can offer an additional approach to enhance the awareness and insights of participants in a mindfulness-based program. Specific guidelines may be developed to enhance the learning of participants.
