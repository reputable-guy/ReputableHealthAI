Study Title: Glycemic and sleep effects of daytime compared with those of overnight infusions of home parenteral nutrition in adults with short bowel syndrome: A quasi-experimental pilot trial.

Study Summary:
Patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) dependent on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) commonly cycle infusions overnight, likely contributing to circadian misalignment and sleep disruption. The objective of this quasi-experimental, single-arm, controlled, pilot trial was to examine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of daytime infusions of HPN in adults with SBS without diabetes. Enrolled patients were fitted with a continuous glucose monitor and wrist actigraph and were instructed to cycle their infusions overnight for 1 wk, followed by daytime for another week. The 24-h average blood glucose, the time spent >140 mg/dL or <70 mg/dL, and sleep fragmentation were derived for each week and compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes were also compared between the weeks. Twenty patients (mean age, 51.7 y; 75% female; mean body mass index, 21.5 kg/m) completed the trial. Overnight infusions started at 21:00 and daytime infusions at 09:00. No serious adverse events were noted. There were no differences in 24-h glycemia (daytime-median: 93.00 mg/dL; 95% CI: 87.7-99.9 mg/dL, compared with overnight-median: 91.1 mg/dL; 95% CI: 89.6-99.0 mg/dL; P = 0.922). During the day hours (09:00-21:00), the mean glucose concentrations were 13.5 (5.7-22.0) mg/dL higher, and the time spent <70 mg/dL was 15.0 (-170.0, 22.5) min lower with daytime than with overnight HPN. Conversely, during the night hours (21:00-09:00), the glucose concentrations were 16.6 (-23.1, -2.2) mg/dL lower with daytime than with overnight HPN. There were no differences in actigraphy-derived measures of sleep and activity rhythms; however, sleep timing was later, and light at night exposure was lower with daytime than with overnight HPN. Patients reported less sleep disruptions due to urination and fewer episodes of uncontrollable diarrhea or ostomy output with daytime HPN. Daytime HPN was feasible and safe in adults with SBS and, compared with overnight HPN, improved subjective sleep without increasing 24-h glucose concentrations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04743960 (https://classic. gov/ct2/show/NCT04743960).
