Study Title: Effects of different forced-air warming systems on the core temperature of patients: a manikin and multi-center clinical study.

Study Summary:
The use of forced-air warming (FAW) blankets is widely recognized for preventing shivering and hypothermia in patients under general anesthesia. Various types of products are currently available for hospitals, and we have conducted a preliminary evaluation of insulation equipment based on expert opinions and initial parameters. However, we lack real-world experiments and accurate clinical data to validate these parameters and the accuracy of our decision-making results. This study aims to confirm the effectiveness of different FAW systems by assessing the thermal protection and operational characteristics of the equipment in both experimental and clinical settings, thereby enhancing our evaluation database. In the manikin test, we conducted six tests including heat distribution and heating rate, heater outlet temperature stability, etc. In the clinical study, patients were randomly assigned to four groups [Group A (Bair Hugger Therapy, 3&#xa0;M, St. Paul, MN, USA; 63500); Group B (EQUATORlevel I, Smith Medical ASD, MN, USA; Snuggle Warm, SW-2013); Group C (Jiang Men Da Cheng Medical Devices Co., Ltd, China; IOB-006); and Group D (Shang Hai Nest Tech Medical Materials Co., Ltd, China; BH-017)], with each group comprising 30 individuals. At the start of anesthesia induction, the FAW blanket was activated and set to 43&#xa0;&#xb0;C until the completion of surgery. The primary endpoint was the average core body temperature during surgery. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamic and surgical variables, adverse events, and recovery metrics. In the manikin test, the observed results of the experimental parameters (heat distribution, air pressure difference, and hole observation test) for Group A are superior to those of the other groups. In the clinical study, although the mean perioperative core body temperature remained above 36&#xa0;&#xb0;C across all groups [Group A: 36.31&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.04; Group B: 36.26&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.06; Group C: 36.17&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.03; Group D: 36.25&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05], patients in Group A maintained higher temperatures compared to the other groups (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Among patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of colorectal cancer with general anesthesia, all four FAW systems effectively prevented perioperative hypothermia. However, the system in Group A minimized heat loss more effectively than the others, providing superior thermal protection. ChiCTR2200065394, 03/11/2022.
