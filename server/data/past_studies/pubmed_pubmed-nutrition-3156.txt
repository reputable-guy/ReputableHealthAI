Study Title: The effect of a pre-meal snack and/or postprandial exercise on breakfast glycemic excursion in adults with cystic fibrosis: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes (CFRD), a common comorbidity in CF, is often preceded and characterized with elevated postprandial glycemic (PPG) excursions. In the general population, the consumption of a pre-meal protein snack and/or physical activity (PA) hinder the elevation of PPG levels. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of a pre-meal snack and/or post-meal PA on PPG excursions in CF. This is a double-blinded randomized controlled crossover interventional study in 14 adults with CF, with 4 interventions: placebo pre-meal snack&#xa0;+&#xa0;no PA (control: CTL), pre-meal soy snack&#xa0;+&#xa0;no PA (SK), placebo pre-meal snack&#xa0;+&#xa0;PA (PA), and pre-meal soy snack&#xa0;+&#xa0;PA (SK&#xa0;+&#xa0;PA). The pre-meal soy snack or placebo beverage (vanilla flavoured water) is served at 8 AM, followed by a standardized breakfast at 9 AM and, postprandially, 5 repeated bouts of 3-min walk every 30&#xa0;min or sedentary activity. Blood glucose and insulin were measured every 15-30&#xa0;min during the interventions. Plasma glucose (PG) was higher 30&#xa0;min after snack consumption compared to placebo beverage. One-hour post-breakfast, PG levels were lower during both PA interventions than with sedentary behavior. However, the overall 3&#xa0;h post-breakfast glucose area under the curve (AUC) was similar between interventions. Post-breakfast 3&#xa0;h insulin AUC was significantly lower during the SK&#xa0;+&#xa0;PA intervention compared to the sedentary behavior interventions. Repeated short bouts of post-meal physical activity may positively impact PPG control in adults with CF, with or without the addition of a pre-meal soy snack. A pre-meal snack alone does not improve PPG.
