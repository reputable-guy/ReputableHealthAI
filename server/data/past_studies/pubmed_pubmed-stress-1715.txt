Study Title: Effect of acupressure in the third eye point (EX-HN 3) on psychological distress, comfort and physiologic parameters among patients undergoing coronary angiography.

Study Summary:
The present study aimed to investigate the effect of acupressure on comfort, anxiety, stress, depression, and vital signs in patients undergoing coronary angiography. This randomized clinical trial was conducted on patients who underwent coronary angiography in Tehran, Iran. Seventy patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention protocol consisted of 20 min of acupressure applied to the Yintang point, and standard medical care was applied to the control group. Depression, Anxiety, and Stress questionnaire (DASS-21), General Comfort Questionnaire (GCQ) questionnaires, and standard monitoring were used as data collection tools before and after intervention, as well as after angiography. Data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test, chi-squared, and analysis of variance of repeated measures in SPSS software, and the level of significance was set at 0.05. The results showed that before acupressure, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Anxiety and stress scores and comfort levels decreased significantly after the intervention (p < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the depression score (p = 0.873). There was a significant decrease in the blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate in the intervention group. Acupressure can reduce the anxiety and stress of angiography candidates and make them more comfortable. It also reduces the blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate. Further studies at different pressure points and on a larger and more detailed scale are necessary.
