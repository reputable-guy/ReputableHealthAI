Study Title: Post-treatment alterations in white matter integrity in PTSD: Effects on symptoms and functional connectivity a secondary analysis of an RCT.

Study Summary:
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to altered communication within the limbic system, including reduced structural connectivity in the uncinate fasciculus (UNC; i.e., decreased fractional anisotropy; FA) and reduced resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Previous research has demonstrated attenuation of PTSD symptoms and alterations in RSFC following exposure-based psychotherapy. However, the relationship between changes in structural and functional connectivity patterns and PTSD symptoms following treatment remains unclear. To investigate this, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of intensive exposure therapy, evaluating alterations in UNC FA, hippocampus-vmPFC RSFC, and PTSD symptoms before (pre-treatment), 7 days after (post-treatment), and 30 days after (follow-up) the completion of therapy. Our results showed that post-treatment changes in RSFC were positively correlated with post-treatment and follow-up changes in UNC FA and that post-treatment changes in UNC FA were positively correlated with post-treatment and follow-up changes in PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that early changes in functional connectivity are associated with sustained changes in anatomical connectivity, which in turn are linked to reduced PTSD symptom severity.
