Study Title: The effects of green tea tablets and metformin on ovulation and menstrual cycle regularity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

Study Summary:
Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common cause of oligo-ovulation and anovulation among women of reproductive age, contributing to infertility. This study aimed to compare the effects of green tea tablets and metformin on ovulation, menstrual cycle regularity, and antioxidant biomarkers in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this clinical trial study, 94 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to three groups: green tea (= 33), metformin (= 29), and control (= 32). Menstrual status and oxidative stress parameters, including total antioxidant capacity, thiol, and lipid peroxidation, were compared before and 3 months after the intervention among all three groups. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software version 22 and employing the analysis of variance and paired t-tests. Following the intervention, the mean menstrual cycle duration in the green tea, metformin, and control groups was 32.22 &#xb1; 12.78, 48.72 &#xb1; 37.06, and 48.53 &#xb1; 31.04 days, respectively (= 0.040). There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups in terms of biochemical, hormonal, and antioxidant indices before and after the intervention (> 0.05). The intake of green tea tablets was associated with better outcomes in regulating the menstrual cycle in women with PCOS.
