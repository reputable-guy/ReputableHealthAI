Study Title: Environmental heat stress offsets adaptation associated with carbohydrate periodization in trained male triathletes.

Study Summary:
Carbohydrate (CHO) intake periodization via the sleep low train low (SL-TL) diet-exercise model increases fat oxidation during exercise and may enhance endurance-training adaptation and performance. Conversely, training under environmental heat stress increases CHO oxidation, but the potential of combined SL-TL and heat stress to enhance metabolic and performance outcomes is unknown. Twenty-three endurance-trained males were randomly assigned to either control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7, CON), SL-TL (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8, SL) or SL-TL&#x2009;+&#x2009;heat stress (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8, SL) groups and prescribed identical 2-week cycling training interventions. CON and SLcompleted all sessions at 20&#xb0;C, but SLat 35&#xb0;C. All groups consumed matched CHO intake (6&#x2009;g&#xb7;kg&#xb7;day) but timed differently to promote low CHO availability overnight and during morning exercise in both SL groups. Submaximal substrate utilization was assessed (at 20&#xb0;C), and 30-min performance tests (at 20 and 35&#xb0;C) were performed Pre-, Post-, and 1-week post-intervention (Post+1). SLimproved fat oxidation rates at 60% MAP (~66% VO) at Post+1 compared with CON (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Compared with SL, fat oxidation rates were significantly lower in SLat Post (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and Post+1 (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Compared with CON, performance was improved at Post in SLin temperate conditions. Performance was not different between any groups or time points in hot conditions. SL-TL enhanced metabolic adaptation and performance compared with CON and combined SL-TL and heat stress. Additional environmental heat stress may impair positive adaptations associated with SL-TL.
