Study Title: [Row-like needling along the spleen meridian combined with autonomous functional exercise in treatment of postpartum diastasis recti abdominis: a randomized controlled trial].

Study Summary:
To observe the clinical effect of the row-like needling along the spleen meridian combined with autonomous functional exercise in treatment of postpartum diastasis recti abdominis. A total of 72 patients with postpartum diastasis recti abdominis were randomly divided into an observation group (36 cases, 3 cases excluded) and a control group (36 cases, 3 cases dropped out). In the control group, the autonomous functional exercise was performed on the rectus abdominis. In the observation group, on the basis of the treatment as the control group, the row-like needling along the spleen meridian was delivered. Along the distribution of the spleen meridian on the abdomen, besides Daheng (SP 15), acupuncture was operated at the sites 3 cm and 6 cm directly above and below Daheng (SP 15) bilaterally. Five points on each side were stimulated along the meridian. Acupuncture was delivered once every two days, 3 interventions a week. One course of treatment, composed of 10 treatments, was required. Before treatment and after 5 and 10 treatments, the inter-rectus distance (IRD) and the score of the medical outcomes study 36-item short form health survey (SF-36) were observed in the two groups, respectively. After 5 and 10 treatments, the IRD at the sites 3 cm above the umbilicus, in the center of the umbilicus and below the umbilicus was reduced when compared with that before treatment in the observation group, respectively (<0.01); and the IRD at the site 3 cm above the umbilicus was decreased in comparison with that before treatment in the control group (<0.05). After treated for 5 times, compared with the control group, the IRD at the site 3 cm below the umbilicus was reduced in the observation group (<0.05); and after treated for 10 times, compared with the control group, the IRD at the sites 3 cm above the umbilicus, in the center of the umbilicus and below the umbilicus was reduced in the observation group (<0.01). After the completion of 5 and 10 treatments, the scores of physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), role-emotional (RE) and health change (HC), as well as the total score of SF-36 were all higher than those before treatment in the observation group (<0.01); while in the control group, the scores of PF, RP and RE, as well as the total score of SF-36 were increased in comparison with those before treatment (<0.01). After 5 treatments, the scores of general health (GH) and HC in the observation group were higher than those of the control group (<0.05,<0.01); and after 10 treatments, the score of PF, GH and HC, as well as the total score of SF-36 in the observation group were higher than those of the control group (<0.01). On the basis of autonomous functional exercise, the row-like needling along the spleen meridian can promote the recovery of postpartum diastasis recti abdominis and improve the quality of life of the patients.
