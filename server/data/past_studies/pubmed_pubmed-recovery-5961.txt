Study Title: A Single-Session, 2-Hour Version of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (One MORE) Improves Chronic Pain Patients' Pain-Related Outcomes Through 3-Month Follow-Up in a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Traditional, 8-week, mindfulness-based interventions can effectively treat chronic pain, but require a time and resource investment too burdensome for many patients and providers. The solution to this logistical challenge may be to distill the core, therapeutic elements of an efficacious 8-week, mindfulness-based intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), into a 2-h, single-session intervention.In this study, the authors conducted a waitlist-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the impact of a 2-h, single-session adaptation of MORE (i.e., One MORE) on chronic pain patients' (&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) pain-related outcomes through 3-month follow-up.Results indicated that One MORE significantly improved chronic pain patients' pain catastrophizing (i.e., primary outcome;&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.97,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), pain intensity (&#x2009;=&#x2009;26.58,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), pain interference (&#x2009;=&#x2009;39.43,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), physical function (&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.29,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), sleep (&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.66,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), anxiety (&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.54,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and depression (&#x2009;=&#x2009;17.48,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). One MORE also significantly increased theoretically indicated therapeutic mechanisms through the 3-month follow-up: mindfulness, positive reappraisal, savoring, self-transcendence.Study results are promising, and if replicated, would suggest that One MORE is a highly scalable, low-cost (e.g., sustainable), nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic pain.
