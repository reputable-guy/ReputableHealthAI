Study Title: High-Flow Nasal Oxygen versus Conventional Nasal Cannula in Preventing Hypoxemia in Elderly Patients Undergoing Gastroscopy with Sedation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
We aimed to compare the prevention of hypoxemia using High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or regular nasal tubing (CNC) in elderly patients undergoing gastroscopy with sedation.This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial conducted at a single center. We included elective patients aged 65 and above who were undergoing gastroscopy with sedation. In the intervention group (HFNO), we set the oxygen flow rate to 60 liters per minute with an oxygen fraction (FiO) of 0.6, while in the control group (CNC), it was 6 liters per minute. The primary outcome was the occurrence of hypoxemia (defined as Spo< 90%).A total of 125 participants were enrolled (HFNO group: n = 63; CNC group: n = 62). The occurrence of hypoxemia was found to be significantly lower in the HFNO group compared to the CNC group (3.2% vs. 22.6%, p = 0.001). Additionally, a significantly shorter duration of low oxygen levels was observed in the HFNO group [0.0 seconds (0.0-13.0)] compared to the CNC group [0.0 seconds (0.0-124.0), p<0.001]. Moreover, a higher minimum Spo2 value was achieved in the HFNO group [99.0% (98.0-100.0) vs. 96.5% (91.0-99.0), p < 0.001], and a shorter recovery time was recorded [0.5 minutes (0.0-0.5) vs. 0.5 minutes (0.0-1.0), p = 0.016] in comparison to the CNC group. There were no differences in terms of comfort level [0 (0-4) vs. 0 (0-5), p = 0.268] between the two groups.The HFNO system was determined to be a safe and highly effective method for oxygen delivery, leading to a reduction in the occurrence of hypoxemia in elderly patients undergoing gastroscopy with sedation. It is recommended that HFNO be considered as the standard approach for management in this population.
