Study Title: Comparison of Mindfulness Practices for Effectiveness of Stress and Burnout Reduction in Healthcare Staff.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of various mindfulness practices for reducing feelings of stress and burnout among healthcare staff.This article contains the quantitative portion of a mixed-methods study.Healthcare workers (=&#x2009;48) were randomly assigned to one of three practices. Data were collected at three-time points (pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and three-weeks-post-intervention). Scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory for Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) were recorded at each time point.Scores on the PSS reduced significantly (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05) across three time periods. Maslach Burnout Inventory for Human Services Survey EE subscale scores reduced significantly (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05) across three time periods. There was no significant difference between the intervention groups on PSS or MBI-HSS scores.All three mindfulness practices were effective in reducing perceived occupational stress and emotional exhaustion. There was no intervention that stood out from the others as the most effective in reducing scores on the PSS and MBI-HSS. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness practices that are short in time and simple in implementation for relieving stress and burnout in healthcare staff.
