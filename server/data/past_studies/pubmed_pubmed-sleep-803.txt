Study Title: Effect of Reflexology on Pain, Fatigue, Sleep Quality, and Lactation in Postpartum Primiparous Women After Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Mothers commonly experience pain, fatigue, sleep disruption, and breastfeeding problems after cesarean delivery. To date, no follow-up study has examined all of these variables to evaluate the utility of reflexology in reducing these problems and supporting breastfeeding. This study aimed to determine the effect of foot reflexology performed in the postpartum period on pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and lactation in primiparous women who underwent cesarean delivery. This is a two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Data were collected between January 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021, with a sample of 80 women who were randomly assigned to the reflexology (&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) and control (&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) groups. The reflexology group received 40&#x2009;minutes of foot reflexology once a week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes of the study were pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and breastfeeding efficacy. Pain scores in the reflexology group decreased by 90.9% in week 1, 90.2% in week 2, and 59.8% in week 3 compared to the control group. Pain resolved at week 4 in the reflexology group and week 7 in the control group. The reflexology group showed a 36.9% decrease in fatigue level, a 48.0% increase in energy level, a 70.7% increase in sleep quality, and a 20.2% increase in breastfeeding efficacy compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Foot reflexology reduces postpartum symptoms and positively affects breastfeeding and can be used safely in postnatal care practices.
