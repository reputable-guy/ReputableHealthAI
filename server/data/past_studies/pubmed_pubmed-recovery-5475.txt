Study Title: The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Empowerment Program on Self-Compassion, Self-Esteem and Ways of Coping With Stress of Women Experienced Violence: A Randomised Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
The aim of this experimental research is to assess the impact of a mindfulness-based empowerment program applied to women who have experienced violence on their levels of self-compassion, self-esteem and coping with stress. The study was a randomised controlled trial with a control group. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) and the control group (CG, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26) from women who had experienced violence. Descriptive statistical methods and t-tests for dependent and independent groups were employed in data analysis. After the mindfulness-based empowerment program, the intervention group exhibited a statistically significant high effect size in post-intervention measurements compared to the control group for the Self-Compassion Scale, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Coping Styles Scale total and subscale mean scores (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The mindfulness-based empowerment program has been found to enhance self-compassion, self-esteem and coping levels in women who have experienced violence. Therefore, it is recommended to promote the widespread adoption of mindfulness-based interventions for individuals who have undergone trauma, such as violence, to facilitate their re-empowerment and functional recovery. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05310656.
