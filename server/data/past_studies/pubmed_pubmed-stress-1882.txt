Study Title: Impacts of an abbreviated personal agency training with refugee women and their male partners on economic empowerment, gender-based violence, and mental health: a randomized controlled trial in Rwanda.

Study Summary:
We assessed the impact of a personal agency-based training for refugee women and their male partners on their economic and social empowerment, rates of intimate partner violence (IPV), and non-partner violence (NPV). We conducted an individually randomized controlled trial with 1061 partnered women (aged 18-45) living in a refugee camp in Rwanda. Women received two days of training, and their partners received one day of training. The follow-up survey where all relevant outcomes were assessed was carried out at 6-9 months post-intervention. At follow up, women in the intervention arm were more likely to report partaking in income generating activities (aIRR 1.27 (1.04-1.54), p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and skill learning (aIRR 1.59 (1.39-1.82), p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and reported a reduction in experience of physical or sexual NPV in the past six months (aIRR 0.65 (0.39-1.07), p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.09). While improved, no statistically significant impacts were seen on physical or sexual IPV (aIRR 0.80 (0.58-1.09), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.16), food insecurity (&#x3b2; 0.98 (0.93 to 1.03), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.396), or clean cookstove uptake (aIRR 0.95 (0.88 to 1.01), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.113) in the past six months. We found statistically significant reduction in physical and sexual IPV amongst those experiencing IPV at baseline (aIRR 0.72 (0.50 to 1.02), p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.07). Small improvements in self-efficacy scores and our indicator of adapting to stress were seen in the intervention arm. Some challenges were also seen, such as higher prevalence of probable depression and/or anxiety (aIRR 1.79 (1.00-3.22), p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) and PTSD (aIRR 2.07 (1.10-3.91), p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. Our findings echo previous research showing personal agency training can support economic well-being of women. We also find potentially promising impacts on gender-based violence. However, there is some evidence that integration of evidence-based mental health support is important when enhancing agency amongst conflict-affected populations. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04081441 on 09/09/2019.
