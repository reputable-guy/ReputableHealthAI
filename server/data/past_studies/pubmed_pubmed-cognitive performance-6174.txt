Study Title: Effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation program combined with cognitive training on exercise tolerance and cognitive functions among Tunisian male patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Cognitive impairment has been well described in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in addition to cardiorespiratory disability. To reduce this impairment, researchers have recommended the use of single or combined exercise training. However, the combined effect of cognitive training (CT) and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program on selective cognitive abilities in patients with COPD has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the impact of PR combined with CT on 6 minutes walking test (6MWT) and cognitive parameters in Tunisian males' patients with COPD. Thirty-nine patients with COPD were randomly assigned to an intervention group (= 21, age = 65.3 &#xb1; 2.79) and a control group (= 18, age = 65.3 &#xb1; 3.2). The intervention group underwent PR combined with CT, and the control group underwent only PR, three times per week for 3&#xa0;months. The primary outcomes were 6MWT (6 minutes walking test -6MWT-parameters) and cognitive performance, as evaluated by Montreal cognitive assessments (MOCA) and P300 test. Secondary outcomes were patient's characteristics and spirometric data. These tests were measured at baseline and after 3&#xa0;months of training programs. Results showed a significant improvement of the 6MWT distance after the rehabilitation period in both groups (< .001). Moreover, both groups showed significant improvement (< .001) in cognitive performance including MOCA score and P300 test latency in three midline electrodes. However, the improvement in cognitive performance was significantly greater in the PR+CT group than the PR group. In conclusion, although PR alone improves 6MWT parameters and cognitive function, the addition of CT to PR is more effective in improving cognitive abilities in patients with COPD. This combined approach may provide clinicians with a complementary therapeutic option for improving cognitive abilities in patients with COPD.
