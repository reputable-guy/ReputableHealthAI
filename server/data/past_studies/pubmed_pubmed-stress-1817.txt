Study Title: Effect of pranayama on perceived stress, well-being and quality of life of frontline healthcare professionals on COVID-19 duty: A quasi-randomised clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Healthcare professionals (HCPs) had to perform their duties under extremely trying circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic. High expectations further increased HCP's stress, which had an adverse impact on their mental health. The present quasi-randomised clinical trial examined how a specially designed pranayama regimen practised for 4&#x2009;weeks affected the mental health of frontline, exposed HCPs in terms of perceived stress, wellness and quality of life. A total of 280 frontline HCPs on COVID-19 duties in five public hospitals of Delhi, India participated in this study. The intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;123) and control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;127) groups were alternately allocated. Data on perceived, self-reported mental health of HCPs were collected at baseline and post-test at the end-line (after 28&#x2009;days of practice). We report that the intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;123) had a substantial lower perceived stress at post-test at the end-line in comparison to the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;127, p-value: .028). Their overall WHO Quality-of-Life score also improved, of which the score on psychological domain increased significantly (p-value: .019). Accordingly, we conclude that a 28-day practice of the pranayama by the frontline HCPs in COVID-19 hospitals significantly decreased their level of perceived stress and enhanced their psychological quality of life.
