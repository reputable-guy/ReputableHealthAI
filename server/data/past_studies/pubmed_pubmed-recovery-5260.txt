Study Title: The efficacy of loco-regional ropivacaine analgesia via intercostal catheters after lung resection: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority study.

Study Summary:
Postoperative pain remains a burden for patients after minimally invasive anatomic lung resection. Current guidelines recommend the intraoperative placement of intercostal catheters to promote faster recovery. This trial aimed to determine the analgesic efficacy of continuous loco-regional ropivacaine application via intercostal catheter and establish this method as a possible standard of care. Between December 2021 and October 2023, patients were randomly assigned to receive ropivacaine 0.2% or a placebo through an intercostal catheter with a flow rate of 6-8&#x2009;ml/h for 72&#x2009;h after surgery. Patients were undergoing anatomic VATS lung resection under general anaesthesia for confirmed or suspected stage I lung cancer (UICC, 8th edition). The sample size was calculated to assess a difference in numerical rating scale associated with pain reduction of 1.5 points. Fourteen patients were included in the ropivacaine group, whereas the placebo group comprised 18 participants. Patient characteristics and preoperative pain scores were similar in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative pain scores and morphine consumption between the 2 groups. The mean numerical rating scale when coughing during the first 24&#x2009;h postoperatively was 4.9 (SD: 2.2) in the ropivacaine group and 4.3 (SD: 2.4); P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.47 in the placebo group. We were unable to determine any effect of administered ropivacaine on the postoperative pulmonary function (FEV1, PEF). Our preliminary results suggest that continuous loco-regional ropivacaine administration via surgically placed intercostal catheter has no positive effect on postoperative pain scores or morphine requirements.
