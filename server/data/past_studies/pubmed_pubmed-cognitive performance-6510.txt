Study Title: Transcranial Infrared Laser Stimulation Improves Cognition in Older Bipolar Patients: Proof of Concept Study.

Study Summary:
This is the first study to examine if transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) improves cognition in older euthymic bipolar patients, who exhibit greater cognitive decline than is expected for age-matched controls. TILS is a non-invasive novel form of photobiomodulation that augments prefrontal oxygenation and improves cognition in young adults by upregulating the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme cytochrome-c-oxidase. We used a crossover sham-controlled design to examine if TILS to bilateral prefrontal cortex produces beneficial effects on cognition in 5 euthymic bipolar patients (ages 60-85). We measured cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, working memory, sustained attention and impulsivity with tasks that have been shown to differentiate between healthy older adults and older bipolar adults. We found TILS-induced improvements in cognitive performance on the tasks that measure cognitive flexibility and impulsivity, after 5 weekly sessions of TILS. We concluded that TILS appeared both safe and effective in helping alleviate the accelerated cognitive decline present in older bipolar patients.
