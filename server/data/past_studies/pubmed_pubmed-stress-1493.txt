Study Title: Feasibility and acceptability of a serious game to study the effects of environmental distractors on emergency room nurse triage accuracy: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
Emergency triage, which involves complex decision-making under stress and time constraints, may suffer from inaccuracies due to workplace distractions. A serious game was developed to simulate the triage process and environment. A pilot study was undertaken to collect preliminary data on the effects of distractors on emergency nurse triage accuracy. A 2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;2 factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed for the study. A sample of 70 emergency room nurses was randomly assigned to three experimental groups exposed to different distractors (noise, task interruptions, and both) and one control group. Nurses had two hours to complete a series of 20 clinical vignettes, in which they had to establish a chief complaint and assign an emergency level. Fifty-five nurses completed approximately 15 vignettes each during the allotted time. No intergroup differences emerged in terms of triage performance. Nurses had a very favorable appreciation of the serious game focusing on triage. The results show that both the structure of our study and the serious game can be used to carry out a future RCT on a larger scale. The lack of a distractor effect raises questions about the frequency and intensity required to find a significant impact on triage performance.
