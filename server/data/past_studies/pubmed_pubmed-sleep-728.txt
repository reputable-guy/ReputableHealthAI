Study Title: Design of OASIS 1 and 2: phase 3 clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of elinzanetant for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

Study Summary:
Elinzanetant is a selective neurokinin-1,3 receptor antagonist in development for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause. The pivotal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies Overall Assessment of efficacy and Safety of elinzanetant In patients with vasomotor Symptoms (OASIS) 1 and 2 will assess the efficacy and safety of elinzanetant in women with VMS. The OASIS 1 and 2 pivotal studies are designed in accordance with regulatory guidance. Postmenopausal women with moderate/severe VMS are randomized to receive 120 mg elinzanetant or placebo once daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 14-week active treatment extension. Primary endpoints are the mean change in frequency and severity of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to weeks 4 and 12. Key secondary endpoints will assess the onset of action and effects on sleep disturbance and menopause-related quality of life. Primary and key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed model with repeated measures. Feedback from postmenopausal women with VMS was used during protocol development. Women confirmed the relevance of endpoints that assess the impact of VMS, sleep disturbance, and mood changes, and the need for new nonhormone treatments. Educational materials around study design, conduct and expected assessments and procedures were developed based on questions and concerns raised by women. The OASIS 1 and 2 pivotal phase 3 studies will enable assessment of the efficacy and safety of elinzanetant as a treatment for VMS, together with its effect on sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and menopause-related quality of life. Feedback from postmenopausal women with VMS was used to maximize patient centricity in the trials.
