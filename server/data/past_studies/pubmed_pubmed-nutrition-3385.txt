Study Title: Reverse-engineered exclusive enteral nutrition in pediatric Crohn's disease: A pilot trial.

Study Summary:
In pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), commercial formulas used as exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) are effective at inducing remission. This study aims to assess the impact of a whole-food blended smoothie as EEN on CD activity and the intestinal microbiome. A 4-week prospective trial assessed the impact of EEN with a whole-food smoothie on newly diagnosed mild-to-moderate active pediatric CD. The smoothie with a multivitamin were developed to meet age-appropriate nutritional requirements. Assessment over 4 weeks included Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), serum laboratories, fecal calprotectin (FCP), and stool collection for metagenomic shotgun sequencing and microbiota composition analysis. Clinical remission was defined as PCDAI&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10 at week 4. Ten participants were enrolled with median age 14.5 years, and 8 completed the trial. Baseline mean PCDAI was 26.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.1 and mean FCP 1149&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;718&#x2009;&#xb5;g/g. At week 4, 80% of participants achieved clinical remission. FCP decreased by over half in 60% of participants, with FCP below 250&#x2009;&#xb5;g/g in 60% and below 100&#x2009;&#xb5;g/g in 40%. Microbiome analysis showed a significant increase in species richness over 4 weeks (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Compared to baseline, the relative abundance at week 2 and at week 4 was significantly increased for Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus and decreased for Blautia (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05 for all). A whole-food blended smoothie was effective for inducing clinical remission and decreasing FCP in pediatric CD similar to commercial EEN formulas. Further research may give insight into data-driven whole-food dietary approaches for CD management. gov NCT03508193.
