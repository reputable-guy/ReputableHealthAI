Study Title: The impact of a virtual mind-body program on symptoms of depression and anxiety among international English-speaking adults with neurofibromatosis.

Study Summary:
The neurofibromatoses (NFs) are a set of incurable genetic disorders that predispose individuals to nervous system tumors. Although many patients experience anxiety and depression, there is little research on psychosocial interventions in this population. The present study examined the effects of a mind-body intervention on depression and anxiety in adults with NF. This is a secondary analysis of the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF (3RP-NF), an 8-week virtual group intervention that teaches mind-body skills (e.g., relaxation, mindfulness) to improve quality of life. Participants were randomized to 3RP-NF or the Health Enhancement Program for NF (HEP-NF) consisting of health informational sessions and discussion. We evaluated depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) at posttreatment, 6&#x2009;months, and 12 months. Both groups improved in depression and anxiety between baseline and posttest, 6 months, and 12 months. The 3RP-NF group showed greater improvements in depression scores from baseline to 6&#x2009;months compared with HEP-NF and with lower rates of clinically significant depressive symptoms. There were no between-group differences for anxiety. Both interventions reduced distress and anxiety symptoms for individuals with NF. The 3RP-NF group may be better at sustaining these improvements. Given the rare nature of NF, group connection may facilitate reduced distress.
