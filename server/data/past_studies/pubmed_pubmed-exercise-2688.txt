Study Title: Novel biomarkers in the saliva of healthy young males and females in a randomized crossover study on sedentary time: An exploratory analysis.

Study Summary:
Several known biomarkers have been used to understand the physiological responses of humans to various short and long-term interventions such as exercise or dietary interventions. However, little exploratory work has been conducted to identify novel biomarkers in human saliva that could enable non-invasive physiological research to understand acute responses to interventions such as reducing sedentary time. The purpose of this study was to identify novel biomarkers in the saliva (cytokines, growth factors and vascular factors) that respond to prolonged (4 hours) and interrupted sitting (4 hours of sitting interrupted by 3 minutes of walking at 60% of maximal heart rate every 27 minutes) in young, healthy males and females. We also sought to determine whether responsive biomarkers would differ by sex. Participants (n = 24, 21.2 &#xb1; 2.2 years, 50% female) completed a prolonged sitting (PS) session and an interrupted sitting (IS) session in random order. Individual saliva samples were pooled into a male sample and a female sample to identify responsive biomarkers using a human cytokine antibody membrane array (42 targets). Several novel biomarkers were responsive in both sexes (e.g., IL-8, Angiogenin, VEGF, and EGF), in females only (e.g., TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-13), and in males only (e.g., IL-3, RANTES, and IL-12p40/p70). Importantly, several biomarkers appear to be responsive to the 4-hour prolonged and interrupted sitting sessions (e.g., TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-8, IL-3, RANTES, EGF, Angiogenin, and VEGF). This work highlights new directions for researchers aiming to investigate the effect of short-term or acute interventions on different physiological pathways using non-invasive methods. Our work clearly indicates that human saliva samples can provide a wealth of insight into physiological responses, and that a number of biomarkers can be used to understand changes induced by acute interventions such as interrupting prolonged sitting.
