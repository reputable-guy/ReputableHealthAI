Study Title: Mobile app for pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of home-based pelvic floor muscle training in women with urinary incontinence, addressing the difficulties arising from social isolation due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic by utilizing a specialized mobile app. This randomized, single-group clinical trial aimed to assess the efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training guided by a mobile app (Diario Sa&#xfa;de) in women with stress urinary incontinence. Participants were instructed via telephone to engage in pelvic floor muscle training exercises twice a day for 30 days. Pre- and post-treatment, participants completed validated questionnaires regarding urinary symptoms and quality of life through telephone interviews. Additionally, treatment adherence was evaluated. A total of 156 women were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 49.3&#xb1;14.2 years. Significant improvements in urinary incontinence symptoms and quality of life were observed following pelvic floor muscle training guided by the mobile app (p<0.001). Notably, 74.3% of the participants reported performing the exercises with appropriate frequency. Of the participants, 62% reported either complete or substantial improvement in urinary symptoms post-treatment. This study revealed notable enhancements in stress urinary incontinence, urinary storage, and overall quality of life subsequent to pelvic floor muscle training guided by a mobile app, particularly during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The mobile app demonstrated robust acceptance and adherence among women experiencing urinary incontinence.
