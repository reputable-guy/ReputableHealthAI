Study Title: A Web-Based and Mobile Intervention Program Using a Spaced Education Approach for Workplace Mental Health Literacy: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Workplace mental health is an important global health concern. This unblinded, phase-III, wait-listed cluster randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) psychoeducation program using a spaced education approach on mental health literacy (MHL) in the workplace. The main interest of this paper was the immediate and 3-month medium-term effect of the program on the MHL of workers. The purposely built mHealth platform was also evaluated as a health-related app. The mHealth platform was designed using the principle of spaced education as a psychoeducation intervention program, with various modules of web-based and mobile materials presented to the participant in a progressive manner. Short quizzes at the end of each module ensured adequate learning, and successful completion qualified the learner to progress to the next level. The trial recruited 456 employees of specific industries with high levels of work-related stress. Participants who were nested in different offices or units were allocated into the intervention and wait-listed control groups using a block randomization process, with the office or unit as the cluster. A separate sample of 70 individual raters were used for the evaluation of the mHealth platform. The Australian National MHL and Stigma Survey and the Mobile Apps Rating Scale were completed through a web-based self-reported survey to assess MHL and evaluate the app. The trial and follow-up data were analyzed by a generalized linear latent and mixed model with adjustments for the clustering effect of work sites and repeated measures. Of the 456 participants in the trial, 236 (51.8%) responded to the follow-up survey. Most MHL outcomes obtained significant results immediately after the intervention and across time. After adjusting for the clustering effect, the postintervention weighted mean scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group for correct recognition of a mental health problem, help seeking, and stigmatization by 0.2 (SE 0.1; P=.003), 0.9 (SE 0.2; P<.001), and 1.8 (SE 0.4; P<.001), respectively. After adjusting for the clustering effect, significant differences across time were found in help-seeking intention (P=.01), stigmatization (P<.001), and social distancing (P<.001). The evaluation of the mHealth program resulted in average scores of the 4 major domains ranging from 3.8 to 4.2, with engagement having the lowest score. The mHealth psychoeducation intervention program using this platform had immediate and 3-month medium-term effects of retaining and improving MHL. The platform was evaluated to have satisfactory performance in terms of functionality, aesthetics, information content, and utility in enhancing MHL. It is anticipated that ongoing development in digital health will provide great benefits in improving the mental health of the global population.
