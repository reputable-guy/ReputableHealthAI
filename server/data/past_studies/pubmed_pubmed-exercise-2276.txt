Study Title: Six Weeks to Wellness: The Role of Breathing Exercises Based on Motor Development Pattern in Improving Fitness and Quality of Life in Overweight Elderly Women.

Study Summary:
Being overweight is a major global health epidemic of the 20th and 21st centuries, which can affect the movement system function of older adult women. This study evaluated the effects of a breathing exercise based on motor development patterns on functional fitness and quality of life in overweight older adult women.A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 40 community-dwelling women aged 65-75. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group, which completed a 6-week breathing exercise program (three supervised and three home-based sessions per week), or a control group, which maintained usual routines. Outcome measures included cardiovascular fitness, upper and lower body flexibility, muscle strength, dynamic balance, and quality of life, assessed at baseline and post-intervention.The intervention group showed significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness (.001, ES = 0.652), upper body flexibility (.001, ES = 0.652), lower body flexibility (.001, ES = 0.538), upper body strength (.001, ES = 0.538), lower body strength (.001, ES = 0.538), and dynamic balance (.001, ES = 0.475) compared to the control group. Quality of life also significantly improved in the intervention group (.001, ES = 0.475).Breathing exercises based on motor development patterns significantly enhance functional fitness and quality of life in overweight older adult women. Incorporating these exercises into regular physical activity routines may promote health and independence in older adults. Further research should explore long-term benefits and optimal exercise parameters for older adults.
