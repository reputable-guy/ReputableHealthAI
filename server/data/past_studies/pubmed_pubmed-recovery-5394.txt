Study Title: The Effect of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Nursing on the Recovery in Patients After Liver Transplantation.

Study Summary:
To explore the effect of enhanced recovery after surgery nursing on the recovery in patients after liver transplantation. This study was performed in 128 patients underwent liver transplantation in our hospital. According to the random number table, these patients were divided into the control group (n = 64) and the experimental group (n = 64). Patients in the control group received traditional nursing, while those in the experimental group received enhanced recovery after surgery nursing. Completion time of the operation, the amount of infused red blood cells during operation, intraoperative anhepatic period, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, the total length of hospitalization, the number of patients reintubated after surgery, the survival rate within 1 year after surgery, and the incidence of postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Intraoperative anhepatic period and the amount of infused red blood cells during operation in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group (both P < .05). Postoperative ICU stay, the total length of hospitalization, and the number of patients reintubated after surgery in the experimental group were decreased when compared with the control group, while postoperative ventilator weaning time was increased (all P < .05). The survival rates at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group (all P < .05). Compared with the control group, the total incidence of complications in the experimental group was reduced (P < .05). The application of enhanced recovery after surgery nursing in liver transplantation patients contributes to the accelerated recovery of body function, shortened total length of hospitalization and ICU stay, declined complications, and increased survival rate within 1 year.
