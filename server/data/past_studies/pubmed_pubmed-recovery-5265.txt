Study Title: Effects of combining rehabilitation training on the recovery of athletic ability after reconstruction of injured ligament.

Study Summary:
This paper aims to investigate the impact of conventional rehabilitation training and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on the recovery of motor abilities in patients following ligament injury reconstruction. Forty postoperative patients who underwent surgery for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) were randomly allocated to either the conventional rehabilitation group or the NMES group. The NMES group received NMES treatment in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program starting from eight weeks postoperatively. Various parameters, including knee joint function, stability, and balance, were compared between the two groups at eight weeks and 12&#x2009;weeks postoperatively. Compared to the data at eight weeks postoperatively, both groups exhibited significant improvements in all measured indicators at 12&#x2009;weeks postoperatively (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In the 12week after the surgery, the NMES group demonstrated a Lysholm score of 93.18&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.67 points, an IKDC score of 84.65&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.33 points, a KT-2000 measurement of 0.88&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.45&#x2009;mm, a thigh circumference difference of -1.33&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.55&#x2009;cm, a knee flexion angle of 130.12&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.21&#xb0;, a single-leg standing time of 60.12&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.33&#x2009;s, a YBT score of 70.26&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.68 points, and a Bulgarian split squat 1RM size of 58.07&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.85&#x2009;kg; all of these results were significantly superior to those observed in the conventional group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). NMES significantly enhances the recovery of athletic ability in patients following postoperative ACLR and can be effectively applied in clinical practice.
