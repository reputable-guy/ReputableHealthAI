Study Title: The effect of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program on the level of perceived stress and geriatric depression in older adults: a randomised controlled study.

Study Summary:
This study aims to reveal the effect of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on the perceived stress and geriatric depression levels of older adults. The data of this randomised controlled experimental study were obtained from older adults living in a nursing home in Turkey, between May and November, 2021. The target population consisted of 54 older adults living in the specified nursing home, and the sample consisted of 48 older adults who met the inclusion criteria (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24 intervention group, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24 control group). The MBSR program was applied to the older adults in the intervention group. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. It was revealed that the MBSR program led to a 54.7% decrease in the perceived stress total scores of the participants, and a 49.9% and 49.8% decrease in the sub-dimensions of perceived insufficient self-efficacy and perceived stress/distress, respectively. It was also found that the program reduced geriatric depression scores by 14.1% and created a significant effect (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). It can be concluded that the MBSR program is an effective method in reducing the perceived stress and geriatric depression levels of older adults. This effect has been maintained 1&#x2009;month after the completion of the program.
