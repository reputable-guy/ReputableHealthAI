Study Title: [Comparison of efficacy and safety between elacycline and polymyxin for complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria].

Study Summary:
To compare the efficacy and safety of eravacycline and polymyxin drugs in the treatment of multidrug-resistant complicated intra-abdominal infections(cIAI).The cIAI patients diagnosed or highly suspected of multidrug resistant bacterial infection who received eravacycline treatment at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital and Shulan (Hangzhou) Hospital from June to August 2023 were prospectively included as the elacycline group. The cIAI patients with cIAI caused by multidrug resistant bacteria who received treatment with polymyxin (B or E) from January 2021 to August 2023 were retrospectively collected. The acute physiology and chronic health scores and age were matched with those of the elacrinid group, and they were included in the polymyxin group. The study mainly analyzed the clinical efficacy, microbial clearance rate, comprehensive efficacy, and safety of the two groups at the end of treatment and discharge.A total of 72 patients with cIAI were included in the study, including 53 males and 19 females, aged (56.0&#xb1;15.4) years. Among them, there were 28 cases in the eravacycline group and 44 cases in the polymyxin group. There was no statistically significant differences in the baseline, the proportion of patients who used combined drugs, the strains, the infection sites and infection conditions of patients between the two groups(all>0.05).The clinical efficacy rate at the end of treatment [89.3% (25/28) vs 56.8%(25/44),=0.004] and discharge [(88.5%(23/26) vs 63.6%,(28/44),=0.024], microbial clearance rate at the end of treatment [(88.9% (24/27) vs 47.6%(20/42),=0.001] and discharge [(91.3%(21/23) vs 59.5%(25/42),=0.007], and overall recovery rate at the end of treatment [(89.3%(25/28) vs 52.3%(23/44),=0.001] and discharge [(88.5%(23/26) vs 63.6%(28/44),=0.024] in the erythromycin group were higher than those in the polymyxin drug group. In terms of safety, only 2 cases of mild vasculitis were observed in the eravacycline group.Combined regimens based on eravacycline showed better clinical effect in the treatment of cIAI caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. The clinical effective rate, microbial clearance rate and comprehensive efficacy were significantly higher than those of polymyxin drugs at the end of treatment and discharge with good safety.
