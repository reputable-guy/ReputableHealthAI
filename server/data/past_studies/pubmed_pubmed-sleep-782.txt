Study Title: Parallel needling technique for peripheral facial paralysis withdeficiency and blood stasis: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To observe the clinical efficacy of the parallel needling technique for peripheral facial paralysis withdeficiency and blood stasis. Sixty-two patients with peripheral facial paralysis ofdeficiency and blood stasis were randomly assigned to a parallel needling group and a conventional acupuncture group, with 31 patients in each group. The conventional acupuncture group received needling at Yangbai (GB 14), Quanliao (SI 18), Jiache (ST 6), Dicang (ST 4), Yifeng (TE 17) on the affected side, Hegu (LI 4) on the healthy side, and bilateral Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Xuehai (SP 10) and Qihai (CV 6) etc. The parallel needling group, in addition to the conventional acupuncture points, received parallel needling at three additional groups of acupoints, i.e. forehead wrinkle group, mid-face group, and corner of the mouth group. Both groups retained needles for 30 min, with one session every other day and a total of three sessions per week, lasting for four weeks. The House-Brackmann (H-B) facial nerve function grading, physical function (FDIP) and social function (FDIS) scores of facial disability index (FDI), TCM syndrome score before and after treatment were compared between the two groups, and the clinical efficacy was assessed. Compared with before treatment, after treatment, both groups showed improvements in H-B facial nerve function grading (<0.05), FDIP total scores and sub-item scores were increased (<0.05), FDIS total scores, sub-item scores, and TCM syndrome scores were decreased (<0.05). After treatment, the parallel needling group showed the higher FDIP total score and eating sub-item score and lower FDIS total score and insomnia sub-item score compared with those in the conventional acupuncture group (<0.05). The total effective rate was 90.3% (28/31) in the parallel needling group and 87.1% (27/31) in the conventional acupuncture group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (>0.05). The parallel needling technique combined with conventional acupuncture, is as effective as conventional acupuncture alone in treating facial paralysis withdeficiency and blood stasis. However, the parallel needling technique combined with conventional acupuncture shows advantages in the improvement of food intake and sleep quality.
