Study Title: The efficacy of lumbar erector spinae plane block for postoperative analgesia management in patients undergoing lumbar unilateral bi-portal endoscopic surgery: a prospective randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The efficacy and reliability of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) in posterior open lumbar spine surgery has been demonstrated; however, few randomized controlled trials of lumbar ESPB (L-ESPB) in lumbar unilateral bi-portal endoscopic (UBE) surgery have been reported. A total of 120 patients, aged 18 to 65 (who underwent elective lumbar UBE surgery under general anesthesia and exhibited an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I to III) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ESPB group and the Control group. Ultrasound(US)-guided unilateral single-shot 0.25% ropivacaine L-ESPB was performed in the ESPB group, but not in the control group. Postoperative analgesic strategy for all patients: patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA, diluted and dosed with fentanyl alone) was initiated immediately after surgery combined with oral compound codeine phosphate and ibuprofen sustained release tablets (1 tablet containing ibuprofen 200&#xa0;mg and codeine 13&#xa0;mg, 1 tablet/q12h) commenced 6&#xa0;h postoperatively. We collected and compared patient-centred correlates intraoperatively and 48&#xa0;h postoperatively. The primary outcomes were intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption and postoperative quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) scores. Compared to the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56), the ESPB group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;58) significantly reduced intraoperative remifentanil consumption (estimated median difference&#x2009;-&#x2009;280 mcg, 95% confidence interval [CI]&#x2009;-&#x2009;360 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;200, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, power&#x2009;=&#x2009;100%); significantly reduced fentanyl consumption at 24&#xa0;h postoperatively (estimated median difference&#x2009;-&#x2009;80mcg, 95%[CI]&#x2009;-&#x2009;128 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;32, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, power&#x2009;=&#x2009;90%); and significantly enhanced the QoR-15 score at 24&#xa0;h postoperatively (estimated median difference 11, 95%[CI] 8 to 14, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, power&#x2009;=&#x2009;100%). Compared to the control group, the ESPB group enhanced the resting numeric rating scale (NRS) score up to 8&#xa0;h postoperatively, and the active movement NRS score up to 4&#xa0;h postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015, power&#x2009;=&#x2009;70%), abdominal distension (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024, power&#x2009;=&#x2009;64%), and muscular calf vein thrombosis (MCVT) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033, power&#x2009;=&#x2009;58%) was lower in the ESPB group than in the control group. Moreover, the occurrence of L-ESPB related adverse reactions was not found herein. US-guided L-ESPB reduces intraoperative and 24&#xa0;h postoperative opioid consumption and improves patients' QoR-15 scores at 24&#xa0;h postoperatively. L-ESPB can be safely and effectively utilized in lumbar UBE surgery. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2200061908 , date of registration: 10/07/2022. Registry URL.
