Study Title: Effect of tetanic stimulation prior to train-of-four monitoring on the time to muscle response stabilization with neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium in patients aged 60 to 80 years: A prospective randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To determine the effect of tetanic stimulation on the time to achieve stabilization of the T1 height, by acceleromyography train-of-four (TOF) ratio monitoring, in patients aged 60 to 80 years. Randomized, prospective, single-blind, controlled trial in patients aged 60 to 80 years undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia in two university hospitals in Brazil between December 2019 and March 2022. This trial was performed in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and the guidelines for good clinical research practice in pharmacodynamic studies of neuromuscular blocking agents II. Participants were randomly allocated by computer-generated numbers to receive tetanic stimulation (intervention group, n&#x2009; = &#x2009;25) or not receive tetanic stimulation (control group, n&#x2009; = &#x2009;25) to achieve T1 height stabilization on TOF ratio monitoring. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the effect of tetanic stimulation on the time to achieve stabilization of the T1 height. We also evaluated the effect on the onset time of rocuronium and time to recover from neuromuscular blockade with a single dose of rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1 with spontaneous recovery. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the time to T1 height stabilization (intervention: 4.3 [2.0-8.0] min; control: 5.8 [2.0-10.5] min; p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.202), onset time of the neuromuscular blocking agent (intervention: 1.9 [&#xb1;0.7] min; control: 2.2 [&#xb1;1.0] min; p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.219), or neuromuscular blockade recovery times to normalized TOF values of 0.7 (intervention: 106.1 [&#xb1;37.2] min; control: 91.7 [&#xb1;27.5] min; p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.295), 0.8 (intervention: 114.3 [&#xb1;40.1] min; control: 97.8 [&#xb1;28.9] min; p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.225), 0.9 (intervention: 126.5 [&#xb1;44.0] min; control: 106.9 [&#xb1;30.6] min; p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.153), and 1.0 (intervention: 138.3 [&#xb1;43.4] min; control: 123.8 [&#xb1;43.5] min; p&#x2009; = &#x2009;0.425). The results of this study suggest that the recommendation to use tetanic stimulation to shorten the time to T1 height stabilization in neuromuscular monitoring did not alter the stabilization time of the T1 twitch or the pharmacodynamics of neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium in patients aged 60 to 80 years.
