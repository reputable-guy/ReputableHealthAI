Study Title: Does whole-body vibration improve risk of falls, balance, and heart rate variability in post-COVID-19 patients? A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) can be a therapeutic recovery strategy for patients hospitalized for COVID-19. To evaluate the effects of a 36-session WBV protocol on the risk of falls, balance, mobility and heart rate variability (HRV). A randomized clinical trial. 13 patients affected by COVID-19, trained with WBV, 3&#xd7;/week on alternate days, totaling 36 sessions, were evaluated before and after the intervention. WBV training at 2&#xa0;mm and 4&#xa0;mm amplitude resulted in a reduction in the risk of falls when compared to Sham (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.023), with effect size of 0.530. No changes were observed for mobility and balance outcomes (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.127) or for any of the HRV variables (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.386). WBV training reduced the risk of falls in post-COVID patients. No changes were observed regarding balance and mobility, nor for HRV.
