Study Title: Did diet compliance and remission reduce oxidative stress in celiac patients?

Study Summary:
We aimed to examine the effect of remission status on thiol-disulfide homeostasis in celiac patients and thus to indirectly determine the effect of oxidative stress and inflammation caused by non-compliance with the diet. Between February 2019 and December 2021, 117 patients diagnosed with celiac disease were included in this prospective randomized and controlled study. In addition to routine tests of celiac patients, thiol and disulfide measurements were made from the blood both at the beginning of the study and at the end of the first year. While 52 of the patients (44.4%) were in remission, 65 patients (55.6%) were not. There was an evident increase in native thiol levels of the patients who were initially not in remission but went into at the end of the first year (347.4&#xb1;46.7 &#x3bc;mol/L vs. 365.3&#xb1;44.0 &#x3bc;mol/L; p=0.001). Mean plasma disulfide levels of patients with celiac going into remission became reduced in the first year from the level of 14.5&#xb1;5.1 &#x3bc;mol/L down to 8.9&#xb1;4.2 &#x3bc;mol/L (p<0.001). In celiac patients who entered remission, disulfide and anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A levels decreased in a correlation (r=0.526; p<0.001). Not being in remission in celiac disease leads to increased oxidative stress, and thiol-disulfide homeostasis is an indirect indicator of this. Additionally, providing remission in celiac patients reduces oxidative stress.
