Study Title: Effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions delivered via technology versus therapist among patients on peritoneal dialysis at an outpatient clinic in Singapore.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to (i) evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in improving self-efficacy, reducing stress and anxiety among peritoneal dialysis patients, and (ii) compare the most effective method of mindfulness based interventions. This randomized three-arm controlled trial recruited first-time peritoneal dialysis patients from the peritoneal dialysis outpatient clinic in Singapore. Patients were randomly allocated to either video-assisted mindfulness training, therapist-assisted mindfulness training or treatment-as-usual. All groups received 4.5&#xa0;days of structured peritoneal dialysis training at the peritoneal dialysis centre, while video-assisted mindfulness training and therapist-assisted mindfulness training groups were taught additional mindfulness-based techniques. The perceived stress scale, self-efficacy, and anxiety (State and Trait Anxiety Inventory) were measured at baseline, 4- and 12&#x2009;weeks post-randomization, using reliable and valid instruments. Thirty-nine patients were recruited (13 in each group). All the therapies showed a significant time trend in anxiety. Only therapist- and video-assisted mindfulness training showed a significant trend in perceived stress scale scores but not treatment-as-usual. All Intervention X Time interactions were not significant. Patients in therapist- and video-assisted mindfulness training groups had reduced perceived stress scale scores compared to treatment-as-usual at week 12. This study demonstrated the potential of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing stress among first-time PD patients.
