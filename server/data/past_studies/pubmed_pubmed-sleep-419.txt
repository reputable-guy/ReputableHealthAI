Study Title: Effect of desflurane maintenance on postoperative sleep quality in patients undergoing elective breast surgery: A non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Postoperative sleep disturbance (PSD) is prevalent in perioperative patients&#xff0c;and has significant impact on postoperative recovery and prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of desflurane maintenance on postoperative sleep quality, in order to optimize patients' perioperative sleep management. A total of 118 patients undergoing elective breast surgery were randomized to receive either desflurane-based volatile anesthesia (desflurane group) or propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (propofol group) for anesthesia maintenance. The primary outcome was the quality of sleep, which was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) on 3 days after operation (POD3). Secondary outcomes were PSQI on postoperative day 7 (POD7) and 30 (POD30), and postoperative anxiety, depression, and pain score, as well as objective sleep parameters including total sleep time (TST), WASO (Wakefulness after sleep onset), REM (Rapid eye movement) and NREM (Non-rapid Eye Movement) measured by Fitbit Charge 2TM during the initial 3 postoperative days. The global PSQI scores on POD3 in the desflurane group was non-inferior to that in the propofol group [mean (SD) 8.47 (3.46) vs. 7.65 (3.16); mean difference (95&#xa0;% CI) 0.82 (-0.43, 2.07); p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001 for non-inferiority]. There were no significant differences in PSQI scores on POD3 and POD7. In addition, the score of anxiety, depression, and pain on the 3rd, 7th, and 30th day after surgery have no significant differences between the propofol and the desflurane group, respectively. The postoperative NREM was higher in the desflurane group than that in the propofol group. The effects of desflurane-based volatile anesthesia maintenance on postoperative sleep quality is not inferior to that of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia, and these two drugs may have different effects on the sleep structure.
