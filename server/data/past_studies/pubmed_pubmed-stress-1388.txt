Study Title: Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v supplementation in patients with major depression in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial: A metabolomics study.

Study Summary:
Understanding the multifactorial nature of major depressive disorder (MDD) is crucial for tailoring treatments. However, the complex interplay of various factors underlying the development and progression of MDD poses significant challenges. Our previous study demonstrated improvements in cognitive functions in MDD patients undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v). To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive functions improvements, we explored underlying metabolic changes. We employed multi-platform metabolomics, including LC-QTOF-MS and CE-TOF-MS profiling, alongside chiral LC-QqQ-MS analysis for amino acids. Supplementation of SSRI treatment with LP299v intensified the reduction of long-chain acylcarnitines, potentially indicating improved mitochondrial function. LP299v supplementation reduced N-acyl taurines more than four times compared to the placebo, suggesting a substantial impact on restoring biochemical balance. The LP299v-supplemented group showed increased levels of oxidized glycerophosphocholine (oxPC). Additionally, LP299v supplementation led to higher levels of sphingomyelins, L-histidine, D-valine, and p-cresol. This exploratory study suggests potential metabolic pathways influenced by LP299v supplementation. However, the need for further research hinders the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Observed metabolic changes were linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota disruption. Despite the subtle nature of this alterations, our research successfully detected these differences and connected them to the metabolic disruptions associated with MDD. Our findings emphasise the intricate relationship between metabolism, gut microbiota, and mental health prompting further research into the mechanisms of action of probiotics in MDD treatment.
