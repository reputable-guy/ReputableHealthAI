Study Title: Nutritional status as independent prognostic factor of outcome and mortality until five years after hip fracture: a comprehensive prospective study.

Study Summary:
We determined the prognostic value of nutritional status for outcome after hip fracture. Nutritional status was a strong independent prognostic factor for clinical outcome and 5-year mortality. Physical function showed incomplete recovery. Elderly care should focus on prevention already before hip fracture. To determine the prognostic value of nutritional status in hip fracture patients for multiple clinical and functional outcomes over 6&#x2009;months, and for new fractures and survival over 5&#x2009;years post-fracture. We included 152 well-characterized subjects (age 55+ years) with a hip fracture from a previously published randomized controlled trial. Nutritional status was appraised using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Multivariable linear, logistic and Cox regression models were fitted, adjusted for age, sex, ASA score, group and additional prognostic covariates identified in backward regression models. At baseline, impaired nutritional status was significantly associated with physical disability, depression, impaired cognition and lower quality of life. Prospective analyses showed that impaired baseline nutritional status was an independent prognostic factor for postoperative complications (OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.01-3.98, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.047), discharge location from hospital (home vs. rehabilitation clinic, OR 0.41, 95%CI 0.18-0.98, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.044), hospital readmission (OR 4.59, 95%CI 1.70-12.4, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.003) and total length of hospital stay (HR of being discharged: 0.63, 96%CI 0.44-0.89, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.008), as well as for 5-year mortality (HR 3.94, 95%CI 1.53-10.2, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.005), but not for risk of new fractures (5y-HR 0.87, 95%CI 0.34-2.24, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.769). Curves of physical disability over time showed that the three nutritional status categories followed almost parallel trajectories from baseline until 6&#x2009;months after hip fracture, without complete recovery and even with further deterioration in malnourished subjects from 3 to 6&#x2009;months post-fracture. As baselline nutritional status is a strong independent prognostic factor for clinical outcome after hip fracture, affecting even five-year survival, elderly health care should focus on prevention and identification of at-risk individuals already before hip fracture.
