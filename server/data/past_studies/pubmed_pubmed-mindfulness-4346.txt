Study Title: Effectiveness of Yoga Intervention in Reducing Felt Stigma in Adults With Epilepsy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Persons with epilepsy are afflicted with comorbidities such as stigma, anxiety, and depression which have a significant impact on their quality of life. These comorbidities remain largely unaddressed in resource-limited countries. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to investigate whether yoga and psychoeducation were effective in reducing felt stigma (primary outcome), neuropsychiatric outcomes, and seizure frequency, as compared with sham yoga and psychoeducation in persons with epilepsy. This was an assessor-blinded, sham yoga-controlled RCT. Patients clinically diagnosed with epilepsy, aged 18-60 years, and scoring higher than the cutoff score for felt stigma as measured by the Kilifi Stigma Scale (KSS) in our population were randomly assigned to receive either yoga therapy plus psychoeducation (intervention) or sham yoga therapy plus psychoeducation (comparator) for a duration of 3 months. The primary outcome was a significant decrease in felt stigma as compared with the comparator arm as measured by the KSS. Primary and secondary outcomes (seizure frequency, quality of life, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, trait rumination, cognitive impairment, emotion regulation) were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Parametric/nonparametric analysis of covariance and the &#x3c7;test were used to compare the 2 arms. A total of 160 patients were enrolled in the trial. At the end of the follow-up period (6 months), the intervention arm reported significant reduction in felt stigma as compared with the control arm (Cohen's= 0.23, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.55,= 0.006). Significantly higher odds of >50% seizure reduction (odds ratio [OR] 4.11, 95% CI 1.34-14.69,= 0.01) and complete seizure remission (OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.75-55.89,= 0.005) were also observed in the intervention group. The intervention group showed significant improvement in symptoms of anxiety, cognitive impairment, mindfulness, and quality of life relative to the control group at the end of follow-up period (< 0.05). Yoga can alleviate the burden of epilepsy and improve the overall quality of life in epilepsy by reducing perceived stigma. Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2017/04/008385). This study provides Class I evidence that yoga reduces felt stigma in adult patients with epilepsy.
