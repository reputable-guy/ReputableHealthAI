Study Title: Effects of Sling-Suspension-Based Active Shoulder Joint Exercise on Shoulder Joint Subluxation, Pain, Muscle Strength, and Upper Limb Function in Patients with Subacute Stroke.

Study Summary:
: We investigated the effects of sling-suspension-based active shoulder joint exercise training on shoulder joint subluxation, pain, muscle strength, and upper extremity function in patients with subacute stroke.: Twenty-eight patients with subacute stroke were randomly assigned to either the sling-suspension-based active shoulder joint exercise (SASE) group (= 14) or the motorized upper extremity exercise (MUEE) group (= 14). The SASE group actively performed shoulder joint flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external and internal rotation, and horizontal abduction and adduction using a sling suspension system, whereas the MUEE group underwent an exercise program using a motorized upper extremity exercise machine. All participants underwent a 4-week intervention with 30 min of exercise once a day for 5 days a week. Additionally, both groups received general physical therapy and functional electrical stimulation for 30 min twice a day for 5 days a week. Shoulder joint subluxation was measured by radiographic examination before and after training, and pain was evaluated in the splenius, upper trapezius, and infraspinatus muscles using pressure parameters. In addition, a manual muscle tester was used to assess the muscle strength of the shoulder joint flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, and external and internal rotators, and the Fugl-Mayer Assessment (FMA) and Manual Functional Test (MFT) were used to evaluate upper extremity function.: A significant group-time interaction was observed for pain, with F-values of(1, 26) = 7.470,< 0.011 for the splenius and(1, 26) = 9.623,< 0.005 for the upper trapezius. A significant time-group interaction was observed for the muscle strength of the shoulder, with F-values of(1, 26) = 13.211,< 0.001;(1, 26) = 4.974,= 0.035 and(1, 26) = 9.674,= 0.004 for flexors, abductors, and external rotators, respectively. A significant time-group interaction was observed in the FMA, with F-values of(1, 26) = 13.243,< 0.001. When comparing the interaction effects between time and group for MFT scores, a significant difference was observed, with F-values of(1, 26) = 32.386,< 0.001.: This study confirmed that sling-suspension-based active shoulder joint exercises are effective in improving shoulder joint subluxation, pain, muscle strength, and upper extremity function in patients with subacute stroke.
