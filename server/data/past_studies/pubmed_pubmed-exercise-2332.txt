Study Title: Effects of inhaled beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium vs. beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate and placebo on lung hyperinflation and exercise endurance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The single-inhaler triple combination of beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium (BDP/FF/G) is available for maintenance therapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cardinal features of COPD are lung hyperinflation and reduced exercise capacity. TRIFORCE aimed to evaluate the effect of BDP/FF/G on lung hyperinflation and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. This double-blind, randomised, active- and placebo-controlled, crossover study recruited adults with COPD aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;40 years, who were hyperinflated and symptomatic, and were receiving mono- or dual inhaled maintenance COPD therapy. In the three treatment periods, patients were randomised to receive BDP/FF/G, BDP/FF, or placebo, each for 3 weeks, with a 7-10-day washout between treatment periods. Assessments included slow inspiratory spirometry (for resting inspiratory capacity [IC]) and constant work-rate cycle ergometry (for dynamic IC and exercise endurance time). The primary objective was to compare BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF vs. placebo for resting IC at Week 3. Key secondary objectives were to compare BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF vs. placebo for dynamic IC and exercise endurance time during constant work rate cycle ergometry at Week 3. Of 106 patients randomised, 95 completed the study. Resting IC adjusted mean differences vs. placebo were 315 and 223 mL for BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF, respectively (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001 for both). Adjusted mean differences vs. placebo for the key secondary endpoints were: 245 mL for dynamic IC (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and 69.2&#xa0;s for exercise endurance time (nominal p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) with BDP/FF/G, and 96 mL (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.053) and 70.1&#xa0;s (nominal p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) with BDP/FF. Differences between BDP/FF/G and BDP/FF for resting and dynamic IC were 92 and 149 mL (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01 for both). All three treatments were generally well tolerated, with 27.3%, 25.3% and 19.0% of patients reporting adverse events with BDP/FF/G, BDP/FF and placebo, respectively, all mild or moderate. In patients with COPD, BDP/FF/G provided significant and clinically relevant improvements vs. placebo and BDP/FF in static and dynamic hyperinflation, with an improvement vs. placebo in exercise endurance.
