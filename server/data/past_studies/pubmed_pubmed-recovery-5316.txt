Study Title: This is the first in-human trial and prospective case series of a novel single-port robotic system for gynaecological surgery: An IDEAL stage 2a study.

Study Summary:
The Shurui&#xae; system (SR-ENS-600) is a novel fully integrated single-port robotic system with bioinspired serpentine surgical manipulators and a camera. This was a single-centre prospective case-series study according to the IDEAL stage 2a guidelines to evaluate the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of the Shurui&#xae; system for gynaecological surgeries and to improve the operating process. Ten patients with a gradient of surgical difficulty who had indications for laparoscopic surgery and who volunteered to participate in a clinical trial were enrolled in the study. All 10 subjects successfully completed the procedure without converting to other procedures. No serious complications were reported at the 3-month follow-up. Subjects recover faster after surgery and are highly satisfied with the incision. Gynaecological single-site laparoscopic surgery with the Shurui&#xae; system was technically feasible for well-selected patients with minimal alterations&#xa0;in technique. Further prospective multicenter large-sample studies are necessary. ChiCTR2300075431. URL: https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=189995.
