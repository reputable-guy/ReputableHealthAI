Study Title: Enhancing patient outcomes through nursing care in laparoscopic common bile duct exploration; a randomized control trail.

Study Summary:
When compared to open surgery, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is known to cause less discomfort and a faster recovery. This study examines the effect of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) strategy on LCBDE outcomes. In March 2021 to May 2024, 400 patients with LCBDE participated in randomized research. The six patient groups were: Multimodal Pain Management (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50), Standard Pain Management (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50), ERAS (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50), Preoperative Assessment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100), Standard Preoperative Assessment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100), and Standard Care (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50). The patient's satisfaction, long-term recovery, pain, anxiety, and complication rates were among the outcomes that were measured. After the intervention, the mean anxiety level of the ERAS group was significantly lower (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), and their rates of complications were also decreased. Reduced postoperative pain scores, which were 5 on day 1 and decreased to 3 by day 3, were the consequence of the multimodal pain management strategy inside ERAS. A 90% satisfaction rating and an average recovery period of five days were reported by the ERAS group. Long-term results in ERAS showed that the average time to return to work was only 25 days, and there was a decreased incidence of chronic pain. The ERAS protocol enhances the short- and long-term course of recovery for patients with LCBDE, leading to increased satisfaction and better clinical outcomes. These results suggest that the ERAS method should be used as the gold standard for postoperative care for patients with LCBDE.
