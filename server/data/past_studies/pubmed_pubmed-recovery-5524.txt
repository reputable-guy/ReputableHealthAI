Study Title: A Novel Formulation of Ketorolac Tromethamine (NTM-001) in Continuous Infusion in Adults with and without Renal Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Pharmacologic Study.

Study Summary:
There is a medical need for a safe, effective nonopioid postoperative analgesic for older subjects, including those with mild to moderate renal impairment. Participants (&#x2265;&#x2009;65&#xa0;years) were stratified by no, mild, or moderate renal impairment defined as creatinine clearance 60-89&#xa0;mL/min for mild and 30-59&#xa0;mL/min for moderate. Subjects were randomized to receive a loading dose of 6.25&#xa0;mg of ketorolac tromethamine drug candidate NTM-001 followed by a 1.75&#xa0;mg/h continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 24&#xa0;h or an IV bolus injection of ketorolac tromethamine (KETO-BOLUS) of 15&#xa0;mg every 6&#xa0;h. There were four treatment periods of 24&#xa0;h for each subject with a minimum 7-day washout between them. This was a crossover study so subjects served as their own controls. Blood drawn from the subjects was used to plot concentration-time profiles against target profiles. Adverse events were monitored. Thirty-nine subjects enrolled. Concentration-time profiles showed low intersubject variability. Model-predicted curves for those with renal impairment closely matched observed plasma concentrations. Continuous infusion maintained higher mean plasma concentrations than the bolus regimen. No serious or unexpected adverse events were observed. No deaths occurred. NTM-001 was considered safe and well tolerated in this population of participants&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;65&#xa0;years, including in those with mild or moderate renal impairment. There were fewer adverse events in the continuous infusion group. The predictable pharmacologic properties and blood concentration levels suggest that continuous IV infusion of ketorolac can be used as an effective postoperative pain reliever in older subjects.
