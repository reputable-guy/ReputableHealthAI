Study Title: Effects of early nutritional intervention on oral mucositis and basic conditions in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer: Randomized controlled trial (ChiCTR2000031418).

Study Summary:
This study aims to observe the effects of early nutritional intervention on radiation-induced oral mucositis (OM) and the nutritional status of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) receiving radiotherapy. Eligible patients receiving radiotherapy for HNC were randomly divided into an early nutritional intervention group (enteral nutritional intervention was administered at the beginning of radiotherapy) and a late nutritional intervention group (enteral nutritional intervention was administered at the beginning of eating restriction) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was radiation-induced OM. Secondary endpoints included nutrition-related indicators, immune function, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life, and other radiotherapy-induced adverse effects. A total of 100 patients were enrolled between 2020 and 2021, including 50 each in the early nutritional intervention group and in the late group. The incidence of Grade-III/IV OM was lower in the early treatment group than in the late treatment group (2% vs 14%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.059). By week 7 weight loss was significantly lower in the early group than in the late group (1.08&#xa0;kg, 95% CI: 0.08-2.09, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.035). Regarding the PG-SGA scores after receiving radiotherapy, the early group comprised more well-nourished and fewer malnourished patients than those in the late group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). The scores of the immune function indices of T cell CD3, CD4/CD8, and B cell CD19were slightly higher in the early group than in the late group; however, the difference was not statistically significant (all P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). PFS and OS were better in the early group than in the late group; however, the differences were not statistically significant (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). Early nutritional intervention can effectively improve the nutritional status and reduce the incidence of high-grade OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy.
