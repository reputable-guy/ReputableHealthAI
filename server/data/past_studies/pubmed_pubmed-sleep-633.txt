Study Title: Efficacy of lebrikizumab in adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: 16-week results from three randomized phase 3 clinical trials.

Study Summary:
Lebrikizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting IL-13, previously demonstrated clinical efficacy in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials that included adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD): ADvocate1, ADvocate2, and ADhere. This subset analysis evaluated 16-week physician- and patient-reported outcomes of lebrikizumab in the adolescent patients enrolled in these three trials. Eligible adolescents (&#x2265;12 to <18&#x2009;years weighing &#x2265;40kg) were randomized 2:1 to subcutaneous lebrikizumab (500&#x2009;mg loading doses at baseline and Week 2 followed by 250&#x2009;mg every 2&#x2009;weeks) or placebo as monotherapy in ADvocate1&2, and in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) in the ADhere study. Week 16 analyses included clinical efficacy outcomes (IGA (0,1) with &#x2265;2-point improvement, EASI 75, EASI 90), patient-reported Pruritus NRS &#x2265;4-point improvement and Sleep-Loss Scale &#x2265;2-point improvement. Pooled ADvocate1&2 16-week results in lebrikizumab (&#x2009;=&#x2009;67) vs placebo (&#x2009;=&#x2009;35) were: IGA (0,1) 46.6% vs 14.3% (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), EASI 75 62.0% vs 17.3% (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), EASI 90 40.7% vs 11.5% (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), Pruritus NRS 48.9% vs 13.1% (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), and Sleep-Loss Scale 26.9% vs 6.9% (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.137). Corresponding results for ADhere, (lebrikizumab&#x2009;+&#x2009;TCS,&#x2009;=&#x2009;32; placebo&#x2009;+&#x2009;TCS,&#x2009;=&#x2009;14), were consistent. Lebrikizumab treatment demonstrated efficacy in improving the signs and symptoms of AD in adolescent patients, consistent with the ADvocate and ADhere overall population results.
