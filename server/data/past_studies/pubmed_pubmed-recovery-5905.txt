Study Title: Auricular Acupressure in Relieving PONV and Promoting Gastrointestinal Function Recovery in Females After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The role of current pharmacological treatment after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is limited. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after LSG remains high. Auricular acupressure (AA) is believed to relieve PONV after laparoscopic surgeries, but its role in patients with obesity after LSG has yet to be confirmed. Ninety-five female patients who underwent LSG were randomized into two groups: AA combined with conventional anti-nausea medication (AA group, 47 patients) or conventional anti-nausea medication group (control group, 48 patients). Index of nausea and vomiting and retching (INVR) scores, postoperative anti-vomiting medication use, time of first anus exhausting, time of first fluid intake, and time of first to get out of bed were collected within 48 h after surgery. Demographic data of patients in both groups were balanced and comparable. INVR score (F = 7.505, P = 0.007), vomiting score (F = 11.903, P = 0.001), and retching score (F = 12.098, P = 0.001) were significantly lower in the AA group than that in the control group within 48 h postoperatively. Use of metoclopramide was significantly less in the AA group than in the control group (4.7 [5.5]) vs. 8.8 [7.6], P = 0.004); time to first anus exhausting was significantly less in the AA group than in the control group (17.50 [6.00] vs. 20.42 [8.62], P = 0.020). AA combined with conventional anti-vomiting agents can alleviate PONV in female patients after LSG, and AA can promote gastrointestinal exhaustion. The trial has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) with the registration no. ChiCTR2100047381 on June 13, 2021.
