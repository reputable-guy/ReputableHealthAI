Study Title: The impact of mindfulness on cancer-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors with cognitive complaints.

Study Summary:
Interventions that target cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors are needed. In this study, the potential of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce CRCI in breast cancer survivors, compared with physical training and a wait list control group, was investigated. Breast cancer survivors with cognitive complaints (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;117) were randomly allocated to a mindfulness (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;43), physical training (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;36), or wait list control condition (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38). Participants completed neuropsychological tests and questionnaires before the intervention, immediately after, and 3 months after intervention. The primary outcome measure was the change in cognitive complaints over time. Secondary outcomes were objective cognitive impairment and psychological well-being. All outcomes were compared between groups over time using linear mixed models, including participants with missing values. Of the 117 included participants, 96 completed the three assessments. Participants in the three groups reported decreased cognitive complaints after intervention, without group differences. There were no between-group differences in objective cognitive impairment after intervention compared with baseline. Compared with the wait list control group, participants reported increased mindfulness skills and reduced emotional distress after mindfulness and reduced emotional distress and fatigue after physical training. Contrary to the hypothesis, all groups reported an improvement in cognitive complaints over time. It is suggested that priming and acknowledgment of CRCI might alter the experience of cognitive impairment. Additionally, both mindfulness-based intervention and physical training can improve psychological well-being of breast cancer survivors with cognitive complaints.
