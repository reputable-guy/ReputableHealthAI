Study Title: Effects of combined aerobic and resistance training on the inflammatory profile of children with overweight/obesity: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
We assessed the effects of a 20-week combined (aerobic and resistance) exercise training programme on the inflammatory profile of prepubertal children with overweight or obesity. Totally 109 participants (10.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years, 41% girls) were randomly allocated to an exercise or control group. Adiponectin, C-reactive protein, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, leptin, tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) were analysed in plasma. Total white blood cell (WBC) count and immune subpopulations (eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) were also determined. No intervention effect was found for any of the analysed biomarkers (all p&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.05). We observed a significant sex by intervention interaction for IL-1&#x3b2; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). When stratifying the sample by sex, the exercise programme induced a significant effect on IL-1&#x3b2; levels (mean Z-score difference, 0.66 [95% confidence interval 0.32-1.01]) in girls, but not in boys. A lower number of girls in the exercise group showed a meaningful reduction in IL-1&#x3b2; (i.e., &#x2265;0.2 standard deviations) than in the control group (15% vs. 85%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). This exercise programme failed to improve the inflammatory profile in prepubertal children with overweight/obesity. Future studies should explore the effect of longer exercise interventions and in combination with diet.
