Study Title: Exploring the Impact of Astaxanthin Supplementation in Conjunction with a 12-Week CrossFit Training Regimen on Selected Adipo-Myokines Levels in Obese Males.

Study Summary:
Obesity is associated with an exacerbated metabolic condition that is mediated through impairing balance in the secretion of some adipo-myokines. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore the impact of astaxanthin supplementation in conjunction with a 12-week CrossFit training regimen on some selected adipo-myokines, insulin insensitivity, and serum lipid levels in obese males. This study is a randomized control trial design; 60 obese males were randomly divided into four groups of 15, including the control group (CG), supplement group (SG), training group (TG), and combined training and supplement group (TSG). The participants were subjected to 12 weeks of astaxanthin (AST) supplementation [20 mg/d capsule, once/d] or CrossFit training or a combination of both interventions. The training regimen comprised 36 sessions of CrossFit, each lasting 60 min, conducted three times per week. The metabolic indices, body composition, anthropometrical, cardio-respiratory, and also some plasma adipo-myokine factors, including decorin (DCN), activin A, myostatin (MST), transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x3b2;1, and follistatin (FST), were examined 12 and 72 h before the initiation of the main interventional protocols, and then 72 h after the final session of the training protocol. There was no significant difference in the baseline data between the groups (> 0.05). There were significant interactions between group x time for DCN (&#x3b7;= 0.82), activin A (&#x3b7;= 0.50), FST (&#x3b7;= 0.92), MST (&#x3b7;= 0.75), and TGFB-1 (&#x3b7;= 0.67) (< 0.001 for all the variables). Significantly changes showed for DCN in TSG compared to TG and SG and also TG compared to SG (= 0.0001); for activin A in SG compared to TG (= 0.01) and TSG (= 0.002); for FST in SG compared to TG and TSG (= 0.0001), also in TSG compared to TG (= 0.0001); for MST in SG, TG, and TSG compared to CG (= 0.0001) and also in TSG compared to SG (= 0.0001) and TG (= 0.001); for TGFB-1 in SG, TG, and TSG compared to CG (= 0.0001) and also TSG compared to SG (= 0.0001) and TG (= 0.001). The 12-week CrossFit training concurrent with AST supplementation reduced anthropometric and metabolic factors and also serum lipid levels while producing positive changes in body composition and cardiovascular factors. Increased FST and DCN and reduced activin A, MST, and TGF-&#x3b2;1 were other affirmative responses to both interventions.
