Study Title: EMDR treatment in patients with personality disorders. Should we fear symptom exacerbation?

Study Summary:
Clinicians are often hesitant to use trauma-focused therapy for patients with personality disorders (PDs) because of concerns that the pathology may worsen.Exploring trajectories of change and individual exacerbations in psychological distress and suicidal thoughts in patients with a PD without comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during EMDR therapy or waiting time.In a randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of five sessions of EMDR therapy was compared with a waitlist in 97 outpatients. Acute suicidal patients were not included in this study. Psychological distress and suicidality scores were measured on a weekly basis during the EMDR and waiting list (WL) periods and at 3-month follow-up. Data were analysed in a descriptive manner for individual patients, and hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify patterns of change among clusters of patients. Mann-Whitney U and chi-squared tests were used to explore differences in specific patient characteristics between the found clusters of patients.Patients generally improved, and no clusters of patients deteriorated during the EMDR therapy. Session-to-session exacerbations occurred in both the EMDR (psychological distress: 10.0%; suicidal thoughts: 28.0%) and WL group (psychological distress: 28.0%; suicidal thoughts: 43.5%). Two percent of patients in the EMDR group and 8.7% of patients in the WL condition showed an increase in psychological distress, whereas 2.0% of patients in the EMDR group and 10.9% of patients in the WL condition showed an increase in suicidal thoughts posttreatment compared to baseline.These results show that although individual exacerbations in psychological distress and suicidal thoughts occur, these were less likely to occur in response to EMDR therapy compared with no therapy. Continuation of therapy following exacerbation led to a decrease in psychological distress and suicidal thoughts in most patients.
