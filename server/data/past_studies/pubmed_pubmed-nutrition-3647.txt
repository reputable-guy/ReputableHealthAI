Study Title: Advance Care Planning Affects End-of-Life Treatment Preferences Among Patients With Heart Failure: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study explored the effects of advance care planning interventions on end-of-life treatment decisions among patients with heart failure. The study design was a randomized controlled trial. An intervention involving a motivational video, a cartoon version educational brochure, and a guided discussion was implemented. A total of 82 hospitalized patients with heart failure were recruited. Half of the participants received the intervention, and the other half received routine care. The Life Support Preferences Questionnaire was the primary measurement instrument. Before the advance care planning intervention, a significant difference between the experimental and control groups was observed in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation score but not the total, antibiotics, surgery, and artificial nutrition and hydration scores. In the experimental group but not in the control group, significant differences were observed between pretest and posttest total, antibiotics, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, surgery, and artificial nutrition and hydration scores. Significant differences in mean score changes were observed in total and each treatment score between the experimental and control groups. The advance care planning intervention led participants to select fewer medical treatments. This intervention may be suitable for societies where people are unfamiliar with advance care planning and may feel uncomfortable discussing death.
