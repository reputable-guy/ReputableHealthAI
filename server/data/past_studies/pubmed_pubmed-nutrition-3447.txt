Study Title: High Dose Fish Oil Added to Various Lipid Emulsions Normalizes Superoxide Dismutase 1 Activity in Home Parenteral Nutrition Patients.

Study Summary:
(1) ObjectivesIntestinal failure in home parenteral nutrition patients (HPNPs) results in oxidative stress and liver damage. This study investigated how a high dose of fish oil (FO) added to various lipid emulsions influences antioxidant status and liver function markers in HPNPs. (2) Methods: Twelve HPNPs receiving Smoflipid for at least 3 months were given FO (Omegaven) for a further 4 weeks. Then, the patients were randomized to subsequently receive Lipoplus and ClinOleic for 6 weeks or vice versa plus 4 weeks of Omegaven after each cycle in a crossover design. Twelve age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included. (3) Results: Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activity and oxidized-low-density lipoprotein concentration were higher in all baseline HPN regimens compared to HCs. The Omegaven lowered SOD1 compared to baseline regimens and thus normalized it toward HCs. Lower paraoxonase 1 activity and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) concentration and, on the converse, higher alkaline phosphatase activity and cholesten concentration were observed in all baseline regimens compared to HCs. A close correlation was observed between FGF19 and SOD1 in baseline regimens. (4) Conclusions: An escalated dose of FO normalized SOD1 activity in HPNPs toward that of HCs. Bile acid metabolism was altered in HPNPs without signs of significant cholestasis and not affected by Omegaven.
