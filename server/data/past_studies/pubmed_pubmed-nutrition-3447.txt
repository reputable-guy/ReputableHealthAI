Study Title: Calorie Restriction and Time-Restricted Feeding: Effective Interventions in Overweight or Obese Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy Treatment with Curative Intent for Cancer.

Study Summary:
This study assesses the feasibility of calorie restriction (CR) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) in overweight and obese cancer patients who realized little to no physical activity undergoing curative radiotherapy, structured as a prospective, interventional, non-randomized open-label clinical trial. Of the 27 participants initially enrolled, 21 patients with breast cancer were selected for analysis. The participants self-selected into two dietary interventions: TRF, comprising a sugar and saturated fat-free diet calibrated to individual energy needs consumed within an 8 h eating window followed by a 16 h fast, or CR, involving a 25% reduction in total caloric intake from energy expenditure distributed across 4 meals and 1 snack with 55% carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 30% fats, excluding sugars and saturated fats. The primary goal was to evaluate the feasibility of these diets in the specific patient group. The results indicate that both interventions are effective and statistically significant for weight loss and reducing one's waist circumference, with TRF showing a potentially stronger impact and better adherence. Changes in the LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and insulin were not statistically significant.
