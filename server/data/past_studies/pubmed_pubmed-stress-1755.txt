Study Title: The impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction training on the occupational stress and burnout experienced by nurses in geriatric wards? A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
In this clinical trial, 60 nurses from three geriatric centers were enlisted and randomly split into two groups: control (n = 30) and intervention (n = 30). Statistical analysis using SPSS version 21 employed Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Chi square, and t-test to assess results. The intervention group received eight training sessions. After the MBSR Training in the intervention groups, results showed there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups concerning the scores of the subscales of death and dying (t = 6.161, P < 0.001), conflicts with physicians (t = 7.962, P < 0.001), inadequate preparation (t = t = 6.524, P < 0.001), lack of support resources (t = 5.532, P < 0.001), conflicts with nurses (t = -6.632, P < 0.001), workload (t = 6.587, P < 0.001), uncertainty of treatment (t = 5.587, P < 0.001) as well as the scores of the subscales of burnout.
