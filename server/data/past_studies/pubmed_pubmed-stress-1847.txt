Study Title: The effect of aqueous extract of Iranian oak (Quercus brantii) on antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in beta-thalassemia patients: Randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Frequent administration of blood in &#x3b2;-thalassemia patients can lead to over-loaded iron, a reduction in the levels of antioxidant activities in the body, and oxidative stress. This study was done to evaluate the antioxidant and protective effect of aqueous oak (Quercus brantii) extract supplementation on these patients. This clinical trial was performed on 60 major &#x3b2; thalassemia patients dividing them into intervention and control groups. In addition to taking desferrioxamine (DFO), the control and intervention groups received respectively placebo capsule supplementation and aqueous Quercus extract capsules (300&#xa0;mg/day) for 3 months. Serum lipid profiles (LDL-c, HDL-c, triglyceride), Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), Glucose, Uric acid, urea nitrogen (BUN), Creatinine, LFT (Liver Function Tests) such as SGOT, SGPT, ALP, Total bilirubin, Direct bilirubin, ferritin, MDA and carbonyl protein (CO) levels were measured before and after the period. In addition, the activity of catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was measured in the red blood cell. Furthermore, antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of aqueous Quercus were recorded to standardize capsule formulation. Mean serum MDA, and protein CO, significantly decreased in the intervention group with &#x3b2;-TM after 3 months of treatment with Quercus extract. In addition, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme and Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) significantly increased in comparison with the control group. Changes in serum creatinine, BUN, and alanine transferase were not significant. In the study, Quercus extract capsules contain 48/56&#xa0;mg gallic acid/g (dry extract) total phenol, 58/6&#xa0;mg/g (dry extract), and flavonoids of 63/8&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/ml antioxidant power which by GC/MS analysis has been measured. At the end of the study, serum MDA decreased from 48.65&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8.74 to 43.94&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10.39 &#x3bc; mol/l after administration of oak extract and protein CO dropped from 2.44&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.38 to 1.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.31&#xa0;nmol DNPH/mg protein after administration of the oak extract. At the end of the study serum, TAC increased in patients interventional group from 907&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;319 to 977&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;327&#xa0;&#x3bc;mol FeSO4/l compared to the control group 916&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;275 to 905.233&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;233&#xa0;&#x3bc;mol FeSO4/l with placebo, and SOD increased from 1577&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;325 to 2079&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;554 U/l (compared to 1687&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;323 U/l with placebo). The treatment effect of Quercus was measured using a mixed-effects model of variance analysis for changes in MDA, protein CO, TAC, and SOD, with significant effects being demonstrated for each laboratory parameter (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.15, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02, and P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.003, respectively). Aqueous Quercus extract, due to its high antioxidant potential, reduced MDA, serum carbonyl protein, and increased superoxide dismutase activity effectively decreased serum OS and enhanced serum antioxidant capacity in patients with &#x3b2;-thalassemia major. oak given as an adjuvant therapy to standard iron chelators may provide an improvement in the OS measurements obtained in these patients. This study was submitted, evaluated, and approved by the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT: http://www.irct.ir; IRCT2015101411819N4), which was established for national medical schools in Iran.
