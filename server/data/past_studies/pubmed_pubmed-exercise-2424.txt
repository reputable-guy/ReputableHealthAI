Study Title: Validity of an Exercise Log for Measuring Duration of Exercise in Older Women With Knee Osteoarthritis.

Study Summary:
To examine the validity and usability of a paper log for evaluating exercise duration in older women. Data from 23 females (mean age = 70.4 years) who completed an 8-week pilot randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of yoga and aerobic/strength training on knee osteoarthritis were included in this secondary analysis. Participants were asked to complete a paper log and video recording of their home exercise sessions. Concurrent validity was high between minutes reported on the paper logs and video recordings during Weeks 2 to 7 (= 0.878). Usability was high, with participants completing 79% to 91% of paper logs and 74% to 100% of video diaries weekly. Overall minutes reported on the paper exercise logs and video diaries were positively correlated to Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly scores at 8 weeks. Exercise logs are a valid and useful method in assessing adherence to prescribed exercise duration in unsupervised home programs. [(5), 219-225.].
