Study Title: Effects of Mozart-Orff parent-child music therapy among mothers and their preschool children with autism spectrum disorder: A mixed-methods randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) negatively impacts mental health, particularly in mothers of autistic children who experience heightened stress. Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and music therapy are recognised interventions for improving ASD symptoms. However, the specific benefits of parent-child music therapy and ABA for autistic children and their mothers remain uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of parent-child music therapy on preschool autistic children and their mothers. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 100 mother-child pairs assigned to either the control group receiving ABA or the intervention group receiving both music therapy and ABA. Qualitative interviews were conducted post-intervention for 12 mothers. Children in the intervention group exhibited lower scores for ASD symptoms than those in the control group. Moreover, mothers in the intervention group demonstrated reduced dysfunctional parent-child interaction, lower overall parental stress, significantly improved family functioning, and increased levels of hope compared with those in the control group. Mothers held positive views regarding music therapy. Combining ABA with parent-child music therapy can alleviate ASD symptoms in children and reduce stress in mothers. Improved parent-child interaction and enhanced family functioning further support the benefits of this combined approach. Parent-child music therapy, combined with ABA demonstrated positive outcomes for autistic children, including reduced ASD symptoms, improved parent-child interaction, decreased parental stress, enhanced family functioning, and increased hope. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating music therapy as a valuable component in the comprehensive treatment of ASD. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial registry (05/07/2021, ChiCTR2100048261, https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=128957 ). Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of Fujian Medical University and the study hospital (Fujian Provincial Maternity and Child Health Hospital; 2017&#x2009;-&#x2009;105), and informed consent was obtained from all subjects and/or their legal guardian(s).
