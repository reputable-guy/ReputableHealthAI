Study Title: The self-management and transition manual "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE" for adolescents with chronic kidney disease.

Study Summary:
To examine the effects of "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE", a novel six-week, self-directed patient education manual designed to improve chronic kidney disease knowledge/self-management, health care transition readiness, self-advocacy, and mindfulness skills among adolescents with chronic kidney disease. We enrolled 49 adolescents aged 11-17 years (mean age 14.7 &#xb1; 1.9; 53.1% males) from a university hospital kidney center who had CKD stages 3 and greater, who were randomly assigned into the "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE" patient education only group (n = 31) or the "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE" patient education plus mindfulness training group (n = 18). Participants completed Qualtrics surveys at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. The survey included measures of outcome variables (i.e., self-management/transition readiness, patient self-advocacy, and mindfulness), and an additional demographic questionnaire was included in the baseline survey. Multilevel model analyses were used to examine the effects of group and time on the outcome variables. Multilevel model analyses showed an overall significant time effect across all outcome variables in both groups. However, the group effects were not statistically significant across the outcome variables. Both interventions significantly increased participants' self-management/HCT readiness, self-advocacy, and mindfulness over time. Mindfulness training may not bring additional benefits to the "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE" education manual. Pediatric nurses and clinicians may utilize the self-directed "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE" manual to increase self-management/transition readiness, self-advocacy, and mindfulness among adolescents with chronic kidney disease.
