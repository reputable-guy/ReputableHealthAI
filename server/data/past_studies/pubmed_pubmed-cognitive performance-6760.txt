Study Title: [Long-term individual cognitive stimulation program in patients with mild neurocognitive disorder: a pilot study].

Study Summary:
There is evidence to suggest that cognitive stimulation produces cognitive benefits in people with mild neurocognitive disorder. However, the effect has been previously demonstrated to be minimal to moderate and the effect of long-term individual interventions, namely on specific cognitive domains, is unknown. To assess the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a long-term individual cognitive stimulation intervention for patients with mild neurocognitive disorder. Patients (n = 30) with mild neurocognitive disorder were assigned to a cognitive stimulation intervention group (n = 15) or to a control group (n = 15). The intervention consisted of 88 individual sessions, approximately 45 minutes long, with two sessions per week. External evaluators assessed the level of alteration in cognitive performance, depressive symptoms and the level of independence in the performance of basic activities of daily living. After the intervention, a significant improvement was found in the intervention group compared to the control group in overall cognitive performance (d = 0.83), specifically in the language domain (d until 1.50). There were also lower depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared to the control group (d = 0.93). Only 6.7% of the participants dropped out the study, with participants attending a mean of 83 &#xb1; 12.1 sessions. The results support the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for mild neurocognitive disorder and justify a randomized controlled trial of the program with a larger sample.
