Study Title: Comparison of Effects of Sugammadex and&#xa0;Neostigmine on Postoperative Neuromuscular Blockade Recovery in Patients with Interstitial Lung Diseases Undergoing Transbronchial Cryobiopsy: A Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND While many studies have been conducted on sugammadex sodium and neostigmine in patients undergoing general anesthesia, few have explored their effects in patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-three patients who underwent transbronchial cryobiopsy under general anesthesia were enrolled in a prospective randomized study. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: neostigmine combined with atropine group (group C, n=32) and sugammadex group (group S, n=31). Induction and maintenance of anesthesia were the same in both groups. Patients received rocuronium during anesthesia. At the end of the procedure, when the T2 of the train-of-four stimulation technique (TOF) monitoring appeared, neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg combined with atropine 0.02 mg/kg was injected intravenously in group C, and sodium sugammadex 2 mg/kg was injected intravenously in group S. Time from administration of muscle relaxant antagonist to recovery of TOF ratio (TOFr) to 0.9 and extubation time were recorded. The residual rate of neuromuscular blockade at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min after extubation was calculated. RESULTS Compared to group C, group S had a significantly shorter recovery time of TOFr to 0.9 (4.0[2.0] min vs 14.0[11.0] min, P<0.001) and extubation time (4.0[3.0] min vs 11.0[7.0] min, P<0.001). The residual rate of neuromuscular blockade was remarkably lower in group S than in group C at 3, 5, and 7 min after extubation (3.2% vs 31%, 0% vs 25%, 0% vs 6%, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Sugammadex is more effective than neostigmine in reversing the muscle-relaxant effect of rocuronium bromide in patients with ILDs.
