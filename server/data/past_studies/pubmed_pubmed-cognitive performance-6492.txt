Study Title: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Exercise and Protein Effectiveness Supplementation Study (EXPRESS) on Reducing Frailty Risk in Community-Dwelling Older People.

Study Summary:
This pilot study aimed to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a 6-months multi-component exercise program combined with twice daily consumption of either rice (RicePro) or whey-based (WheyPro) protein supplements (2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;20&#x2009;g of protein) on gait speed, grip strength and physical performance in community-dwelling pre-frail and frail older adults. Secondary outcomes included: frailty score, muscle mass, quality of life, nutritional intake, cognitive performance, depression and physical activity levels. A total of 70 participants (mean age 73.34&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.85&#x2009;years) were randomly allocated to either RicePro (&#x2009;=&#x2009;36) or WheyPro (&#x2009;=&#x2009;34). No adverse events were reported in regards to the exercise, however, several gastrointestinal symptoms were noted with the whey protein causing two-fold more symptoms compared to the rice protein. No differences were found between the groups (&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05), except the total consumed energy (kJ) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014) and fat (g) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012) which was significantly lower in WheyPro. The results indicate that the quality of protein may not be as important as long as a sufficient amount is consumed.
