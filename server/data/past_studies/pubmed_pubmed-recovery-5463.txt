Study Title: Internet&#x200a;+&#x200a;wearable device training effects on limb function recovery and serum neurocytokine content in stroke patients.

Study Summary:
The traditional method of post-hospital intervention and guidance of stroke patients has some limitations. To investigate the effects of Internet&#x200a;+&#x200a;wearable device training on limb function recovery and the levels of serum neurocytokines (BDNF, NT-3, and NGF) in stroke patients. 80 stroke patients with hemiplegia were randomly selected from the Department of Neurorehabilitation, Affiliated Rehabilitation Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. They were divided into a control group and an observation group, with 40 patients in each group. The control group received routine post-hospital follow-up guidance, while the observation group received Internet remote home rehabilitation guidance combined with wearable device training. The interventions were compared between the two groups. At 4 weeks and 12 weeks after discharge, the observation group showed higher scores on the Fugl-Meyer scale (FMA), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), modified Barthel Index (MBI), stride length, gait speed, gait frequency, and higher levels of BDNF, NT-3, and NGF. Additionally, the observation group had lower scores on the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (P&#x200a;<&#x200a;0.05). The application of Internet remote home rehabilitation guidance combined with wearable device training in stroke patients with hemiplegia can improve limb function recovery. It effectively increases the levels of BDNF, NT-3, and NGF, promoting the nutritional repair of damaged nerves. These findings hold clinical significance.
