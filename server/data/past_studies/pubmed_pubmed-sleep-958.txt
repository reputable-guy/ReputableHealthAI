Study Title: Upper-lower limb and breathing exercise program for improving sleep quality and psychological status in multiple sclerosis: a pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To examine the feasibility and possible effect of an 8-week exercise program on sleep quality, insomnia and psychological distress in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Twenty-four individuals with MS were recruited into a controlled pre-post feasibility study and divided into 2 groups: exercise (= 13; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 1.0-7.5) and a related control group with no exercise (= 11; EDSS: 1.0-7.0). The exercise group performed combined upper limb, lower limb and breathing exercises in a controlled group (2d/week, 60&#xa0;min/session) for 8 weeks. Participants were administered measures to evaluate sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), psychological distress (Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure, CORE-OM) and additionally impact of fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MFIS) after 8-weeks. Insomnia severity measured with ISI ((1;22)=5.95,= 0.023,= 0.213, 90% CI = 0.02-0.42) and psychological distress measured with the CORE-OM ((1;22)=4.82,= 0.039,= 0.179, 90% CI = 0.01-0.40) showed statistically significant group-by-time interaction. Sleep quality measured with the PSQI showed statistically significant group-by-time interaction only in an aspect of daytime sleep dysfunction ((1;22)=5.33,= 0.031,= 0.195, 90% CI = 0.01-0.40). The fatigue impact measured with the MFIS showed statistically significant group-by-time interaction in physical ((1;22)=6.80,= 0.016,= 0.236, 90% CI = 0.02-0.44) and cognitive aspects ((1;22)=9.12= 0.006,= 0.293, 90% CI = 0.05-0.49), and total score ((1;22)=11.29,= 0.003,= 0.339, 90% CI = 0.08-0.52). Our 8-week program reduced insomnia severity, psychological distress and some aspects of fatigue (physical; cognitive; total), and improved sleep quality in an aspect of daytime sleep dysfunction in a small group of individuals with MS. Good feasibility and significant positive changes from baseline warrant further exploratory work.
