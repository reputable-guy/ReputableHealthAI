Study Title: The application of 5E rehabilitation management mode in the nursing of patients with aortic dissection complicated by obstructive sleep apnea.

Study Summary:
This study was designed to explore the effect of 5E rehabilitation mode (encouragement, education, exercise, employment, and evaluation)&#xa0;in patients with aortic dissection (AD) complicated by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients with Stanford type B AD (TBAD) complicated by OSA were admitted to Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from January 2019 to December 2020. They were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group. After discharge, patients in the control group were given routine nursing and follow-up education, whereas patients in the experimental group were given 5E rehabilitation management mode-based nursing and follow-up education. Upon the nursing intervention, the differences in polysomnography (PSG) parameters, medication adherence, quality of life, blood pressure, and heart rate of patients between the two groups were compared. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors for the occurrence of adverse aortic events. A&#xa0;total of 89 patients were enrolled, 49&#xa0;in the experimental group and 40 in the control group.&#xa0;After the intervention, the control of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, medication adherence, PSG parameters, and quality of life scores in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse aortic events including aortic rupture and progressive aortic dilation in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that acute TBAD [odds ratio (OR) = 15.069; 95%confidence interval (CI), 1.738-130.652; P=0.014], history of chronic kidney disease (OR=10.342; 95%CI, 1.056-101.287; P=0.045), and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &#x2265; 30 (OR=2.880; 95%CI, 1.081-9.51; P=0.036) were adverse factors affecting adverse aortic events; while 5E rehabilitation management mode (OR=0.063; 95%CI, 0.008-0.513; P=0.010) was a favorable factor for occurrence of adverse aortic events. The findings suggest that continuous nursing based on information carrier 5E rehabilitation management significantly enhanced medication adherence, improved patients' overall quality of life, and decreased the incidence of adverse aortic events in patients&#xa0;TBAD patients and OSA.
