Study Title: Decentralized ORP Measurements for Gut Redox Status Monitoring: Toward Personalized Gut Microbiota Balance.

Study Summary:
Gut microbiome targeting has emerged as a new generation of personalized medicine and a potential wellness and disease driver. Specifically, the gut redox balance plays a key role in shaping the gut microbiota and its link with the host, immune system, and disease evolution. In this sense, precise and personalized nutrition has proven synergy and capability to modulate the gut microbiome environment through the formulation of dietary interventions, such as vitamin support. Accordingly, there are urgent demands for simple and effective analytical platforms for understanding the relationship between the tailored vitamin administration and the gut microbiota balance by rapid noninvasive on-the-spot oxidation/reduction potential monitoring for frequent and close surveillance of the gut redox status and targeting by personalized nutrition interventions. Herein, we present a disposable potentiometric sensor chip and a homemade multiwell potentiometric array to address the interplay of vitamin levels with the oxidation/reduction potential in human feces and saliva. The potentiometric ORP sensing platforms have been successfully validated and scaled up for the setup of a multiapplication prototype for cross-talk-free simple screening of many specimens. The interpersonal variability of the gut microbiota environment illustrates the potential of feces and saliva samples for noninvasive, frequent, and decentralized monitoring of the gut redox status to support timely human microbiota surveillance and guide precise dietary intervention toward restoring and promoting personalized gut redox balance.
