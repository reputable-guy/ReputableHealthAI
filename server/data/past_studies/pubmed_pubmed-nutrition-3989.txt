Study Title: Hindmilk as a Rescue Therapy in Very Preterm Infants with Suboptimal Growth Velocity.

Study Summary:
Despite advances in neonatal nutrition, very preterm infants remain at increased risk of extrauterine growth faltering. This prospective study aimed to examine the effect of hindmilk, the milk at the end of a breast expression session, on growth and plasma fatty acids (FAs) of infants born <30 weeks' gestation who had been on full enteral feeds for &#x2265;2 weeks and had a weight gain of <15 g/kg/day despite optimizing energy and protein intakes. Weight and plasma FAs were assessed before and two weeks after feeding hindmilk. Growth anthropometrics were assessed weekly for four weeks. Paired t-tests and multiple linear regression were used for statistical analyses of data from 34 infants and their 29 mothers. There was a significant increase in weight gain in the two weeks after feeding hindmilk (MD 3.9, 95%CI 1.2-6.5 g/kg/day). Weight Z-scores were larger at two weeks (MD 0.61, 95%CI 0.02-1.20) and onwards. Head circumference Z-scores were larger at three weeks (MD 0.83, 95%CI 0.20-1.47) and onwards. Plasma linoleic acid (LA) and &#x3b1;-linolenic acid (ALA) increased after feeding hindmilk. In conclusion, hindmilk may improve weight and head growth and increase LA and ALA in very preterm infants with suboptimal growth. A large randomized controlled trial is required to examine and validate the potential benefits of hindmilk.
