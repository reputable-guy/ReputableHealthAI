Study Title: Effects of a novel, brief psychological therapy (Managing Unusual Sensory Experiences) for hallucinations in first episode psychosis (MUSE FEP): Findings from an exploratory randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Hallucinations are a common feature of psychosis, yet access to effective psychological treatment is limited. The Managing Unusual Sensory Experiences for First-Episode-Psychosis (MUSE-FEP) trial aimed to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a brief, hallucination-specific, digitally provided treatment, delivered by a non-specialist workforce for people with psychosis. MUSE uses psychoeducation about the causal mechanisms of hallucinations and tailored interventions to help a person understand and manage their experiences. We undertook a two-site, single-blind (rater) Randomised Controlled Trial and recruited 82 participants who were allocated 1:1 to MUSE and treatment as usual (TAU) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;40) or TAU alone (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42). Participants completed assessments before and after treatment (2 months), and at follow up (3-4 months). Information on recruitment rates, adherence, and completion of outcome assessments was collected. Analyses focussed on feasibility outcomes and initial estimates of intervention effects to inform a future trial. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry 16793301. Criteria for the feasibility of trial methodology and intervention delivery were met. The trial exceeded the recruitment target, had high retention rates (87.8%) at end of treatment, and at follow up (86.6%), with good acceptability of treatment. There were 3 serious adverse events in the therapy group, and 5 in the TAU group. Improvements were evident in both groups at the end of treatment and follow up, with a particular benefit in perceived recovery in the MUSE group. We showed it was feasible to increase access to psychological intervention but a definitive trial requires further changes to the trial design or treatment.
