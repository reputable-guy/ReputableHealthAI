Study Title: The Effectiveness of Low-dose Esmketamine Versus Remifentanil Adjunct to Propofol for Sedation in Patients Undergoing Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation for Trigeminal Neuralgia.

Study Summary:
To access the effectiveness of propofol-esketamine versus propofol-remifentanyl in patients undergoing radiofrequency Thermocoagulation for Trigeminal Neuralgia of gasserian ganglion. In this clinical trial, 80 patients were candidates for RFT were randomly divided into two groups (n= 40). These patients aged from 21 to 81 years old. Before the start of the procedure, both groups received propofol TCI with a target level of 1.5&#xa0;&#x3bc;gml-1. The intervention group (group E) received esketamine 0.15 mgkg-1, and the control group (group R) received remifentanyl 1.0 &#x3bc;gkg-1. The patients, the anesthetists and the surgeons were unaware of the medication regimen. Sedation level (based on a MOAA/S), blood pressure, oxygen saturation, the dosage of propofol, recovery time (based on Aldrete scores), postoperation pain (based on NRS), surgeons and patient satisfaction, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI) were recorded. Data from 80 patients were analyzed. The sedative effects were equal in the two groups (P = .680) and the MOAA/s scores of both groups were basically maintained at or below 2 points, however, the dosage of propofol in group E was significantly less than that in group R [5.3mgkg-1h-1 (5.0 to 5.7) vs 5.8 mgkg-1h-1 ( 5.3 to 6.3), P = .000]. The group E had higher blood pressure levels during the procedure (PSBP = .002, PDBP = .023). Surgeons and patient satisfaction (Ps = .164, Pp = .580), recovery time (P = .228),The NRS values after 24hrs (P = .777)and PQSI showed no significant differences between the two groups (P = .133). Low-dose esketamine reduces the total amount of propofol necessary for sedation and incidence of respiratory depression during RFT of gasserian ganglion in American Society of Anesthesiologists I to III patients without affecting recovery time, satisfaction of surgeons and patients, cardiovascular adverse events, when compared with remifentanil.
