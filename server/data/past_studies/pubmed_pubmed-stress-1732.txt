Study Title: The mental and behavioral health crisis in youth: Strategic solutions post COVID-19 pandemic: An American Academy of Nursing consensus paper.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic wrought significant negative impacts on youth well-being, particularly among Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska Native, and LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) youth. The pandemic disrupted connections to family, school, and community, which are essential supports for youth mental health. Lessons learned from the pandemic suggest the role of stress and windows of opportunity to build resiliency. Drawing from a policy dialog on the youth mental health crisis conducted by 4 American Academy of Nursing Expert Panels, we present approaches to the current increase in youth mental health problems. Included is emerging literature on building youth resilience, particularly via re-establishing school and community connections. The role of families, schools, and community support is emphasized, particularly by creating a healing school environment and the pivotal role of school nurses. Recommendations include increased support for families, engaging the school nurse role, and developing school-based innovative programs to build connections and youth wellness.
