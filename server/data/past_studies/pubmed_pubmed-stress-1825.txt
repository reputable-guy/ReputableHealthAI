Study Title: Co-administration of probiotics and vitamin D reduced disease severity and complications in patients with Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Probiotics have beneficial effects on the nervous system by modulating the gut-brain axis. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation presents a potential way for ameliorating neuropsychological disorders, particularly in regions with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. The current clinical trial aimed to investigate the role of co-administered supplementation of probiotics and Vitamin D on the different inflammatory aspects of patients with Parkinson's disease. Forty-six patients with PD were recruited From the Functional Neurosurgery Research Center, Tehran, Iran. These patients were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups: Group A, who received probiotic/vitamin D supplements (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23), and Group B who received placebo capsules (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23) for 12 weeks. As primary outcomes, Interferon-Gamma (IFN-&#x3b3;), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1&#x3b2;), IL-6, IL-10, Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum were evaluated at the baseline and the end of the trial. Moreover, Additional questionnaire-based factors including gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were evaluated. Our findings demonstrated that the consumption of probiotic/vitamin D supplements leads to a significant decrease in IL-1&#x3b2;, INF-&#x3b3;, IL-6, and MDA levels, while showing a significant increase in IL-10 and TAC levels compared to the placebo group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Additionally, it leads to a significant decrease in the disease severity, anxiety, and gastrointestinal problems in PD patients in comparison to the placebo group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Given the acknowledged role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease on one hand, and the recognized anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects associated with probiotics and vitamin D on the other hand, the concurrent administration of probiotics and vitamin D supplements emerges as a promising and potentially effective treatment option for individuals with PD.
