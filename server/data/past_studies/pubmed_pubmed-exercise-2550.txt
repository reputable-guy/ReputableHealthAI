Study Title: A Qualitative Description of Graduate Students' Perceived Decline in Physical Activity from Undergraduate School.

Study Summary:
Many university students, especially graduate students, are experiencing poor physical and psychological health. Thus, universities are initiating programs like Exercise is Medicine-On Campus (EIM-OC) to promote positive physical activity behavior to improve physical and mental health for primarily undergraduate university students. However, the influences on physical activity when transitioning from an undergraduate to a graduate student are unknown. To explore perceptions of if and how the physical activity levels of graduate students changed from their time as undergraduate students while considering environmental and lifestyle factors. METHODS: Using a qualitative, phenomenological research design, a convenience sample of current graduate students enrolled at a large, mid-South university completed a 20-minute interview. Questions included inquiring on current household, occupational, active transportation, leisure time, and overall physical activity during the graduate and past undergraduate programs. All interviews were transcribed, and major themes were derived using thematic analysis. Twenty-one (62% female; 52% master's students) participants completed interviews. Overall, participants perceived their physical activity decreased, including occupational, active transport, and leisure-time physical activity. Major themes discussed by participants included: increased academic and occupational responsibilities, changes in the physical and social environment, increased awareness of health and activity, and life transitions. The decline in physical activity once individuals enter their graduate program necessitates an intervention, like EIM-OC, during or after undergraduate studies to promote the initiation or continuation of regular physical activity to improve graduate students' overall health.
