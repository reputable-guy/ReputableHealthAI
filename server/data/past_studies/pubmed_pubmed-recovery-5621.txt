Study Title: Clinical efficacy and safety of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for benign adnexal disease: a prospective trial.

Study Summary:
There is a scarcity of prospective clinical research evidence regarding the utilization of transvaginal natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) as a treatment option for ovarian cysts. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of employing vNOTES for the management of ovarian cysts. Our study included women between the ages of 18 and 70 who intended to undergo surgical intervention for benign lesions. Stratified blocked randomization was employed to allocate participants into groups. The main objective was to assess whether the assigned group adhered to the recommended surgical technique for ovarian cystectomy or adnexectomy, without any deviation to alternative surgical methods. A total of 196 patients were included in the study, with all surgeries in each group being conducted according to the assigned procedures. Among them, the ovarian cystectomy layer included 58 cases in the vNOTES group and 58 cases in the conventional laparoscopy (CL) groups. The adnexectomy layer included 40 cases in the vNOTES group and 40 cases in the CL group. Utilizing a sensitivity analysis, the two-sided 95% lower confidence limit was determined to be 5.5% for the disparity in proportions between the vNOTES groups and CL groups. These lower limits fell below the predetermined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The study findings demonstrate that vNOTES was not inferior to CL in terms of adnexectomy or ovarian cystectomy. vNOTES can be considered a more minimally invasive surgical approach, as it results in reduced postoperative pain, faster recovery, and absence of visible incisions. Overall, vNOTES proves to be a safe, feasible, and less invasive treatment option. This study retrospectively registered with the China Clinical Trial Registry with the registration number ChiCTR2100052223(22-10-2021).
