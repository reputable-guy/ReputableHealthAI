Study Title: Financial hardship experience in middle- and older-aged patients with advanced lung cancer.

Study Summary:
Advancements in medical treatments have resulted in increased medical costs for cancer patients. More than half of the patients with advanced lung cancer reported unmet financial needs. The purpose of this study is to examine the differences in the prevalence and correlates of financial hardship between middle- and older-aged patients with advanced lung cancer, and its impact on multiple health-related outcomes. This study presents a cross-sectional analysis involving 226 patients with advanced lung cancer, who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial conducted between 2018 and 2020. Data collection was performed through self-reported questionnaires and electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were adopted for analysis. 58.0% reported experiencing financial hardships. Middle-aged participants who were single and had a lower education level were more likely to experience financial difficulties. However, males and higher performance status were associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing financial difficulties among older-aged participants. Financial hardship was significantly associated with anxiety (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), depression (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), sleep disturbances (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), quality of life, global health status (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), functional scale score (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), symptom scale score (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and lung cancer-specific scale score (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). More than half of the patients with advanced lung cancer experienced financial hardships caused by cancer or its treatment, with a higher prevalence reported in middle-aged patients. Different sociodemographic and clinical variables correlated with financial hardship in middle- and older-aged participants, respectively. More attention should be paid to middle-aged patients with advanced lung cancer, particularly during routine assessments.
