Study Title: Effect of 60-Min Single Bout of Resistance Exercise, Reformer Pilates, on Vascular Function Parameters in Older Adults: A Randomized Crossover Study.

Study Summary:
Aging leads to vascular endothelial dysfunction and muscle impairment. While resistance exercise improves muscular function, its acute effects on vascular function vary in the literature, with some studies reporting detrimental effects. These findings indicate the need for exercises that optimize muscle function without compromising vascular function. Reformer Pilates (RP) is a low-impact exercise involving an adjustable sliding platform. However, the acute effects of RP on vascular function among older adults remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the acute effects of RP on vascular function in older adults. Overall, 17 participants (age: 65 &#xb1; 2.76 years, body mass index: 23.42 &#xb1; 3.68 kg/m2) were examined and assigned to control and RP conditions under a randomized crossover design. The RP condition involved a 3.5-5 omnibus perceived exertion scale with 19 exercise postures for 60 min. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and blood pressure were measured at baseline and 0, 10, 30, and 60 min after exercise. RP significantly improved FMD at all time points compared with that at baseline (p &lt; 0.05). baPWV increased at 0 min post-RP but returned to baseline levels at other time points. Additionally, RP showed improved FMD at 0, 10, and 30 min compared with that in the control condition (p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in blood pressure or mean arterial pressure in either condition. RP enhanced FMD and regulated blood pressure for approximately 60 min post-exercise, suggesting its suitability for older adults to enhance vascular function and control blood pressure during exercise. Nonetheless, longitudinal resistance training intervention studies are needed to validate these findings.
