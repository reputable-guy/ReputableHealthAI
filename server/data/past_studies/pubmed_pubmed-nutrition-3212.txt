Study Title: Becoming Healthier without Paying More? Experimental Evidence from the Impact of Multiple Traffic Lights on Chinese College Students.

Study Summary:
The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese residents has become a pressing public health concern. The UK Multiple Traffic Light labeling system, known for its user-friendly design, has demonstrated success in promoting healthier food choices. This paper presents novel findings from a randomized controlled experiment assessing the impact of traffic light labeling on Chinese consumers' food choices. Results indicate that the label significantly reduces the intake of calories, fat, carbohydrates, and sodium without increasing the economic costs of food choices. This study contributes empirical evidence to the effectiveness of traffic light labeling in China, with implications for the country's approach to front-of-pack nutrition labeling.
