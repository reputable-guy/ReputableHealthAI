Study Title: Effects of Short-Term Nighttime Carbohydrate Restriction Method on Exercise Performance and Fat Metabolism.

Study Summary:
The sleep-low method has been proposed as a way to sleep in a low-glycogen state, increase the duration of low glycogen availability and sleep and temporarily restrict carbohydrates to improve exercise performance. However, long-term dietary restriction may induce mental stress in athletes. Therefore, if it can be shown that the effects of the sleep-low method can be achieved by restricting the carbohydrate intake at night (the nighttime carbohydrate restriction method), innovative methods could be developed to reduce weight in individuals with obesity and enhance athletes' performance with reduced stress and in a shorter duration when compared with those of previous studies. With this background, we conducted a study with the purpose of examining the intervention effects of a short-term intensive nighttime carbohydrate restriction method. A total of 22 participants were recruited among university students participating in sports club activities. The participants were assigned at random to groups, including a nighttime carbohydrate restriction group of 11 participants (6 males, 5 females; age 22.3 &#xb1; 1.23) who started a carbohydrate-restricted diet and a group of 11 participants (5 males, 6 females; age 21.9 &#xb1; 7.9) who continued with their usual diet. The present study had a two-group parallel design. In the first week, no dietary restrictions were imposed on either group, and the participants consumed their own habitual diets. In the second week, the total amount of calories and carbohydrate intake measured in the first week were divided by seven days, and the average values were calculated. These were used as the daily calorie and carbohydrate intakes in the second week. Only the nighttime carbohydrate restriction group was prohibited from consuming carbohydrates after 4:00 p.m. During the two-week study period, all participants ran for one hour each day before breakfast at a heart rate of 65% of their maximum heart rate. The results obtained from young adults participating in sports showed significant differences in peak oxygen consumption (V&#xb7;O2peak), work rate max, respiratory quotient (RQ), body weight and lean body mass after the intervention when compared with before the intervention in the nighttime carbohydrate restriction group (< 0.05). Our findings suggest that the nighttime carbohydrate restriction method markedly improves fat metabolism even when performed for a short period. This method can be used to reduce body weight in individuals with obesity and enhance athletes' performance. However, it is important to consider the intake of nutrition other than carbohydrates.
