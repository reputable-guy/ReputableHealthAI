Study Title: Targeting Anxiety to Improve Sleep Disturbance: A Randomized Clinical Trial of App-Based Mindfulness Training.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbance is experienced by nearly 20% of Americans and is highly comorbid with anxiety. Sleep disturbances may predict the development of anxiety disorders. Mindfulness training (MT) has shown efficacy for anxiety yet remains limited by in-person-based delivery. Digitally delivered MT may target habitual worry processes, yet its effects on sleep have not been studied. This study tested if app-based MT for anxiety could reduce worry and improve sleep and examined the underlying mechanisms. Individuals reporting worry interfering with sleep were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU; n = 40) or TAU + app-based MT (n = 40). Treatment-related changes in worry-related sleep disturbances (WRSDs), worry, nonreactivity, and anxiety were evaluated via self-report questionnaires at 1 and 2 months after treatment initiation. Fitbit devices were used to record total sleep time and estimate sleep efficiency. At 2 months, TAU received access to app-based MT, and both groups were reassessed at 4 months. In a modified intent-to-treat analysis, WRSD scores decreased by 27% in TAU + MT (n = 36) and 6% in TAU (n = 35) at 2 months (median [IQR] change = 11 [4.3] versus 15 [5.0], p = .001). These WRSD reductions were mediated by decreased worry, particularly improved nonreactivity (p values < .001). At 4 months, TAU reported a significant 29% reduction after beginning app-based MT at 2 months and TAU + MT maintained its gains. No significant between-group differences in average estimated total sleep time or sleep efficiency were found after 2 months of using the app. Few mindfulness-related apps have been evaluated for clinical efficacy and/or mechanism. Results from this study demonstrate a mechanistic link between MT and increased emotional nonreactivity, decreased worry, and reduction in reported sleep disturbances, suggesting that app-based MT may be a viable option to help individuals who report that worry interferes with their sleep.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03684057.
