Study Title: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies in Patients With Breast Cancer Under Early Chemotherapy-a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been receiving growing attention in cancer care. This study evaluated the impact of the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on quality of life, psychological distress (anxiety and depression), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy. A total of 101 patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy were randomly assigned to either an 8-week MBSR group (n = 50) or a control group (n = 51). The primary outcome was quality of life, measured on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer. The secondary outcomes were anxiety (Self-rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Self-rating Depression Scale), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies (The Chinese version of Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire). The participants were assessed at baseline (T0) and week 8 (T1). The data were statistically analyzed by SPSS 21.0. The participants in the MBSR group experienced significantly better outcomes in their quality of life, psychological distress, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies than the control group. The MBSR intervention was demonstrated to improve the positive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and quality of life in patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy and significantly reduce the patient's anxiety, depression, and negative cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and help the patients to adjust their mental state and promote positive psychology to improve their quality of life.
