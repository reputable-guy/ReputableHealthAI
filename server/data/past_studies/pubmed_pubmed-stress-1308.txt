Study Title: An Advanced Cardiac Life Support Application Improves Performance during Simulated Cardiac Arrest.

Study Summary:
&#x2003;Variability in cardiopulmonary arrest training and management leads to inconsistent outcomes during in-hospital cardiac arrest. Existing clinical decision aids, such as American Heart Association (AHA) advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) pocket cards and third-party mobile apps, often lack comprehensive management guidance. We developed a novel, guided ACLS mobile app and evaluated user performance during simulated cardiac arrest according to the 2020 AHA ACLS guidelines via randomized controlled trial. &#x2003;Forty-six resident physicians were randomized to lead a simulated code team using the AHA pockets cards (&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) or the guided app (&#x2009;=&#x2009;24). The primary outcome was successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes included code leader stress and confidence, AHA ACLS guideline adherence, and errors. A focus group of 22 residents provided feedback. Statistical analysis included two-sided-tests and Fisher's exact tests. &#x2003;App users showed significantly higher ROSC rate (50 vs. 18%;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024), correct thrombolytic administration (54 vs. 23%;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029), backboard use (96 vs. 27%;&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), end-tidal CO2 monitoring (58 vs. 27%;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033), and confidence compared with baseline (1.0 vs 0.3;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) compared with controls. A focus group of 22 residents indicated unanimous willingness to use the app, with 82% preferring it over AHA pocket cards. &#x2003;Our guided ACLS app shows potential to improve user confidence and adherence to the AHA ACLS guidelines and may help to standardize in-hospital cardiac arrest management. Further validation studies are essential to confirm its efficacy in clinical practice.
