Study Title: Intensity Matters: Effect of Different Work-Matched Efforts on Subsequent Performance in Cyclists.

Study Summary:
To assess the effect of 2 work-matched efforts of different intensities on subsequent performance in well-trained cyclists. The present study followed a randomized controlled crossover design. Twelve competitive junior cyclists volunteered to participate (age, 17 [1]&#xa0;y; maximum oxygen uptake, 71.0 [4.7]&#xa0;mL&#xb7;kg-1&#xb7;min-1). The power-duration relationship was assessed through 2-minute, 5-minute, and 12-minute field tests under fresh conditions (control). On subsequent days and following a randomized order, participants repeated the aforementioned tests after 2 training sessions matched for mechanical work (&#x223c;15&#xa0;kJ/kg) of different intensities (ie,&#xa0;a moderate-intensity continuous-training [60%-70% of critical power; CP] session or a session including high-intensity intervals [3-min repetition bouts at 110%-120% of the CP interspersed by 3-min rest periods]). A significantly lower power output was found in the 2-minute test after the high-intensity training session compared not only with the control condition (-8%, P < .001) but also with the moderate-intensity continuous-training session (-7%, P = .003), with no significant differences between the latter conditions. No significant differences between conditions were found for the remaining tests. As a consequence, the high-intensity training session resulted in significantly lower W' values compared to both the control condition (-27%, P = .001) and the moderate-intensity continuous-training session (-26%, P = .012), with no differences between the 2 latter conditions and with no differences for CP. A session including high-intensity intermittent efforts induces a greater fatigue, particularly in short-duration efforts and W', than a work-matched continuous-training session of moderate intensity.
