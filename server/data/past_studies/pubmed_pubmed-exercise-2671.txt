Study Title: Ketone monoester plus high-dose glucose supplementation before exercise does not affect immediate post-exercise erythropoietin concentrations versus glucose alone.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of consuming ketone monoester plus a high dose of carbohydrate from glucose (KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO) on the change in erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations during load carriage exercise compared with carbohydrate (CHO) alone. Using a randomized, crossover design, 12 males consumed KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO (573&#x2009;mg KE/kg body mass, 110&#x2009;g glucose) or CHO (110&#x2009;g glucose) 30&#x2009;min before 4&#x2009;miles of self-paced treadmill exercise (KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO:51&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13%, CHO: 52&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;12% V&#x307;O) wearing a weighted vest (30% body mass; 25&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3&#x2009;kg). Blood samples for analysis were obtained under resting fasted conditions before (Baseline) consuming the KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO or CHO supplement and immediately after exercise (Post). &#x3b2;HB increased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) from Baseline to Post in KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO, with no change in CHO. Glucose and glycerol increased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) from Baseline to Post in CHO, with no effect of time in KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO. Insulin and lactate increased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) from Baseline to Post independent of treatment. EPO increased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) from Baseline to Post in KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO and CHO with no difference between treatments. Although KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO altered &#x3b2;HB, glucose, and glycerol concentrations, results from this study suggest that KE&#x2009;+&#x2009;CHO supplementation before load carriage exercise does not enhance immediate post-exercise increases in EPO compared with CHO alone.
