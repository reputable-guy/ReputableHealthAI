Study Title: Cognitive performance, mood and satiety following ingestion of beverages imparting different glycaemic responses: a randomised double-blind crossover trial.

Study Summary:
The relationship between postprandial glycaemic responses and cognitive performance, mood and satiety are inconsistent. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of different glycaemic responses, induced by beverages with different glycaemic index (GI) (sucrose and isomaltulose), and a non-glycaemic control (sucralose), on cognition, mood and satiety. In this double-blinded, randomised crossover trial, healthy adults (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55) received sucrose (GI 65), isomaltulose (GI 32) and sucralose (non-caloric negative control) drinks on separate occasions. The Complex Figure test, the Word Recall test, Trail Making Test Part B and the Stroop test were administered 60&#x2009;min after beverages ingestion. Mood and satiety were tested along with cognitive performance. Comparing between isomaltulose and sucrose, there were no significant differences in the mean (95% CI) for the following: Complex Figure: immediate recall -0.6 (-1.7, 0.5), delayed recall -0.8 (-1.9, 0.3); Word recall: immediate recall 0.2 (-0.7, 1.1), delayed recall 0.5 (-0.4, 1.4); Trail Making: completing time -2.4 (-7.5, 2.7)&#x2009;s; Stroop: time used for correct congruent responses -9 (-31, 14)&#x2009;ms and correct incongruent responses -18 (-42, 6)&#x2009;ms. No differences among beverages were found in the mood and satiety scores with exception that participants felt more energetic 60&#x2009;min after isomaltulose ingestion (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028 for difference with sucrose) and hungrier 30&#x2009;min after isomaltulose ingestion (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036 for difference with sucrose; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022 for difference with sucralose). Under these study conditions there is no convincing evidence for an effect of glycaemic response on cognitive performance, mood or satiety.
