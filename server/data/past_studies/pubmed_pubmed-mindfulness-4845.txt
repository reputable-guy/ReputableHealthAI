Study Title: A pilot study assessing the feasibility and acceptability of Project UPLIFT adapted for patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

Study Summary:
People with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are at elevated risk of multiple psychiatric comorbidities. Current treatment gaps highlight the need for time-limited, distance-delivered interventions that can be cost-effectively delivered to patients with PNES. Project UPLIFT is a self-management program addressing mood problems in epilepsy that has not previously been adapted for PNES. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of UPLIFT for patients with PNES. Project UPLIFT was minimally adapted by a multidisciplinary research group at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Participants were recruited into a nonrandomized pilot study and were assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. The intervention was adapted and delivered without additional modification. A total of eight participants enrolled in the trial, and six participated in the first session. All six participants who started UPLIFT completed the intervention, with a 98% attendance record across the eight sessions. At follow-up, 100% reported that UPLIFT provided useful tools for daily life. All participants continued using UPLIFT after completing the program, and 83% felt it helped with seizure management. Preliminary results provide proof-of-concept for future efficacy trials. This study provides initial support for the feasibility and acceptability of Project UPLIFT, minimally adapted for patients with PNES. As a time-limited program that can be distance-delivered to groups of patients, UPLIFT may be well-suited for the healthcare environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
