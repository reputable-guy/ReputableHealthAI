Study Title: The efficacy of online mindfulness-based interventions in a university student sample: Videoconference- or podcast-delivered intervention.

Study Summary:
The increasing mental health issues among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges of delivering face-to-face interventions during lockdowns have increased the demand for online interventions. The report presents results from a randomized controlled trial investigating the benefits of online mindfulness interventions delivered by videoconference or podcast during the early phase of the pandemic in Germany. Fifty university students were randomized to a mindfulness intervention conducted by videoconference (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) or to an unguided training provided by podcasts (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25). All students participated in a 7-week mindfulness intervention. Outcome measures included mindfulness, depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction preintervention and postintervention. The study showed a larger reduction in depression in the videoconferencing group than in the podcast group across per protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. There was a significant increase in mindfulness (PP and ITT samples) and life satisfaction (ITT sample) in both groups. The frequency of home practice was related to positive changes in outcomes but only for the videoconferencing group. The results suggest that mindfulness training delivered via videoconferencing can be a viable option to address depressive symptoms among students. However, both interventions were effective in increasing mindfulness and life satisfaction.
