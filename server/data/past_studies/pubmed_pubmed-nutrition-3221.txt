Study Title: Replacement of the massive amino acid losses induced by hemodialysis: A new treatment option proposal for a largely underestimated issue.

Study Summary:
A series of interesting literature reports acknowledges the notable loss of essential and non-essential amino acids (EAAs and NEAAs) during hemodialysis sessions. These losses may exceed 800&#xa0;g/year, thus contributing towards accelerating the onset of malnutrition in hemodialysis patients (HD). A novel tailored amino acid formula for oral administration was developed to replace total amounts of each individual amino acid lost during dialysis diffusive/convective HD strategies, monitoring the effects produced on nutritional and hematological status. A three-month randomized double-blind study was conducted on 30 subjects over the age of 70 years extrapolated from a total population of 86 hemodialysis patients. The 30 patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a treatment group of 15 HD patients (TG) to whom a novel mixture containing 5.4&#xa0;g of AAs was administered solely on interdialytic days, and a control group of 15 HD patients (CG) who received no amino acid supplementation. The AAs mixture was administered post-dialysis at an extended interval from the end of solute and compartmental rebound to replace AA losses and optimize their role in protein anabolism. The results obtained highlighted a significant improvement in protein intake g/kg/day (Protein Catabolic Rate, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014), and increased IgG (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008) and C3 serum levels (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003) in the TG group alone. Fat mass losses were initially confirmed by means of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011) and plicometry (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) in the CG group alone, although the main objective was to preserve nutritional status and, particularly, muscle mass. The study was extended to investigate the effects produced on anemia, yielding evidence of continued positive effects three months after the end of the study in the TG group alone based on an increase in Hb levels from 11.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.6 to 12.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.6 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004) associated with a reduced demand for erythropoietin i.v. from 12928&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9033 to 9286&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5398 U.I/week (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.012) and iron i.v. from 75.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;55 to 71.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;33.4&#xa0;mg/week (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.045). The results obtained following oral administration of this novel tailored AA replacement mixture aimed at reinstating the high AA losses produced during hemodialysis suggest the mixture should be prescribed as a standard procedure to all HD patients.
