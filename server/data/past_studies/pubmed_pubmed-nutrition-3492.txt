Study Title: Associations of postoperative outcomes with geriatric nutritional risk index after conventional and robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The association between postoperative outcomes of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) and nutrition status among elderly adults remained unclear. The authors aimed to evaluate these associations and provide a nutrition status reference for the surgical technique selection of TKA. In the present study, the authors used data from a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled project, which recruited patients underwent TKA therapy. A total of 88 elderly adults (age &#x2265;65 years old) were included in this study. Their preoperative and postoperative demographic data and radiographic parameters were collected. Clinical outcomes, including postoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle deviation, knee society score (KSS), 10&#xa0;cm visual analog scale, and so on, were observed and compared between the RA-TKA group and the conventional TKA group. Logistic regression was performed to adjust several covariates. In addition, according to the results of restricted cubic splines analyses, all participants were categorized into two groups with GNRI&#x2264;100 and GNRI >100 for further subgroup analyses. Our results showed despite having a lower postoperative HKA angle deviation, the RA-TKA group had a similar postoperative KSS score compared with the conventional TKA group in elderly adults. Among elderly patients with GNRI>100, RA-TKA group achieved significantly more accurate alignment (HKA deviation, P =0.039), but did not obtain more advanced postoperative KSS scores because of the compensatory effect of good nutrition status. However, among elderly patients with GNRI&#x2264;100, RA-TKA group had significantly higher postoperative KSS scores compared to the conventional TKA group ( P =0.025) and this association were not altered after adjustment for other covariates. Considering the clinical outcomes of conventional TKA may be more susceptible to the impact of nutrition status, elderly patients with GNRI&#x2264;100 seem to be an applicable population for RA-TKA, which is more stable and would gain significantly more clinical benefits compared with conventional TKA.
