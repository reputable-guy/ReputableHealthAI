Study Title: Effect of the combination ofsea and front-points on enteral nutrition feeding intolerance in critical illness patients.

Study Summary:
To explore the effects of the combination of-sea and front-points on the feeding compliance rate, the intra-abdominal pressure, the enteral nutrition tolerance score, the score of acute physiological and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-&#x2161; and gastrointestinal function impairment grade in the patients with enteral nutrition feeding intolerance (ENFI) of critical illness and evaluate clinical effect on ENFI after acupuncture at thesea and front-points. Seventy patients of ENFI were randomized into a control group and an observation group, 35 cases in each one. In the control group, the patients were treated with routine regimen combined with intestinal nutrition support. In the observation group, on the basis of the treatment as the control group, acupuncture was applied to Shangwan (CV13), Zhongwan (CV12), Xiawan (CV10), Qihai (CV6) and Guanyuan (CV4), as well as bila-teral Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), Xiajuxu (ST39), Shangjuxu (ST37), Tianshu (ST25) and Daheng (SP15). Of those acupoints, ST25 and SP15 on the same side were attached to one pair of electrodes (20 Hz/100 Hz). Acupuncture was delivered once daily, 30 min each time and for consecutive 7 days. During treatment, the numbers of the cases up to the feeding standard were observed everyday to calculate the feeding compliance rate. The score of enteral nutrition tolerance, the intra-abdominal pressure, the score of APACHE-&#x2161; and the level of acute gastriointestinal injury(AGI) grading were recorded. After treatment, the enteral feeding compliance rate was increased in comparison with that before treatment in the two groups, and the rate in the observation group was higher than that of the control group (0.05) except that on the 2day. The score of the enteral nutrition tolerance, the intra-abdominal pressure, the score of APACHE-&#x2161; and the level of AGI were all reduced (0.05,0.01) when compared with those before treatment in the two groups, and these indicators in the observation group were lower (0.05) than those of the control group. Acupuncture at the-sea and front-points relieves the conditions of ENFI, improves the feeding and the recovery of gastrointestinal function, and benefits the prognosis through increasing the amount of enteral nutrition in ENFI patients.
