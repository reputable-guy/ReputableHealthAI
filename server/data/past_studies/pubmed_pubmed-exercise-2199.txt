Study Title: Engagement in a virtual group-based walking intervention for persons with schizophrenia: a qualitative study.

Study Summary:
Exercise is beneficial for persons with schizophrenia; however, high dropout rates limit the impact of interventions. Virtual exercise programs have the potential to improve engagement; however, few intervention studies of virtual programs have been conducted in this population. This study examined qualitative data from 15 adults with schizophrenia who participated in a pilot randomized controlled trial of Virtual PACE-Life, a live, video-delivered group walking intervention guided by self-determination theory. Interviews elicited feedback on the intervention, barriers and facilitators to engagement, recommendations for intervention refinement, and preferences for exercise programming modality. Rapid qualitative analysis was used to explore similarities and differences between completers (i.e., those that attended&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;50% of virtual walking sessions; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9) and non-completers (i.e., those that attended&#x2009;<&#x2009;50% of virtual walking sessions; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6). Both groups viewed Virtual PACE-Life positively but found the virtual exercise sessions challenging and inadequate for facilitating social interaction. Work obligations impacted completers' attendance whereas technological issues and forgetting impacted non-completers' attendance at virtual walking sessions. Completers preferred virtual exercise programs and non-completers preferred in-person exercise programs. These findings suggest that future virtual group-based walking programs should prioritize enhancing the social aspect, offering scheduling choices, and regularly assessing the perceived difficulty of exercise sessions. These modifications not only have the potential to improve intervention engagement but they also may increase participant autonomy and relatedness, core components of self-determination theory.
