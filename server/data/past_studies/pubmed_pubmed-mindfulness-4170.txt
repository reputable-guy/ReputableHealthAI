Study Title: Adjuvant Psychotherapies to Prevent Relapse in Bipolar Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Several psychotherapy protocols have been evaluated as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy for patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Little is known about their comparative effectiveness. To compare the effectiveness of 2 types of group psychotherapy, skill-oriented, material-based cognitive behavioral therapy (SEKT) and supportive, patient-centered, emotion-focused therapy (FEST), to prevent relapse in patients with euthymic BD. This was a large, observer-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted over 18 months (posttreatment after 6 months; follow-up at 12 and 18 months). In addition to psychiatric care as usual (including mood-stabilizing medication), each participant at 9 clinical outpatient units in Germany received 24 hours of group psychotherapy over 4, full-day sessions spread over 5 months. Patients with euthymic BD type 1 (BD 1) or BD type 2 (BD 2) between the ages of 18 and 50 years were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 forms of psychotherapy, SEKT or FEST. Independent clinicians blinded to patient grouping performed assessments using structured interviews (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders and Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation) and self-rating and clinician rating for inclusion criteria and outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated for time to relapse. Cox proportional hazards statistics and propensity score matching were calculated for the multivariate analysis. Study data were analyzed from March 2020 to September 2022. SEKT intervention is a structured cognitive behavioral therapy integrating elements of interpersonal social rhythm therapy, and of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. FEST psychotherapy has its roots in emotion-focused, supportive, and nondirective therapy. Recurrence of a new affective episode assessed by blinded interviewer with the LIFE interview. In addition, self-rating and clinician rating of depressive and mania symptoms as well as level of social functioning were assessed. Of 348 screened referrals, 305 patients (median [IQR] age, 34 [18-50] years; 162 male [53%]) with euthymic BD 1 or BD 2 were included in the study. A total of 207 patients (68%) had BD 1, 98 (32%) had BD 2, and 278 (91%) received psychiatric care. Both therapies were equally effective in preventing recurrence of a new episode. Outcome (higher rate of new episodes) was not predicted by kind of treatment (SEKT: 69 [49%] relapse; FEST: 63 [46%] relapse) but was predicted by BD 2, comorbidity, attending all sessions, and the interaction of type of treatment by BD 1 or 2. Patients with BD 2 had the highest rate of relapse (60 [61%] relapse), in particular, when treated by SEKT (39 [70%] relapse). Results of this randomized clinical trial revealed that a structured, skill-oriented, material-based cognitive behavioral therapy (SEKT) and a supportive, patient-centered, emotion-focused therapy (FEST) were equally effective in preventing relapse of affective episodes when delivered in a new, intensive group format. Additionally, there were baseline factors, in particular BD 2, that influenced outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02506322.
