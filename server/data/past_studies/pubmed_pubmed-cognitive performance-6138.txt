Study Title: Effect of community-based group exercises combined with action observation on physical and cognitive performance in older adults during the Covid-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigates the impact of community-based exercises with action observation therapy (AOT) on the physical and cognitive performance of older adults experiencing social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred participants aged 65-80 years were randomly divided into two groups: the AOT group, which engaged in balance, strengthening, and mobility exercises guided by 15-minute action observation videos before a 45-minute exercise session, and the control group, which performed the same exercises without action observation. Both groups underwent three sessions per week for eight weeks (24 sessions in total). The assessment tools used in this study included the following: For evaluating mobility and fall risk in older adults, the Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) Test was employed. To assess functional strength of lower extremities, balance, and fall risk, the Five Times Sit-to-Stand (5XSST) Test was administered. Balance and gait were measured using the Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment (TBGA), utilizing the Tinetti Scale. Individuals' confidence in performing daily activities without falling or losing balance was assessed using the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). Furthermore, cognitive functions across multiple domains, including attention-concentration, executive function, memory, language, visual construction skills, abstract thinking, calculation, and orientation, were evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Tests. Results revealed significant improvements in both groups. Group I, which received Action Observation Therapy (AOT) in addition to exercise, demonstrated superior outcomes in the 5XSit-to-Stand test (&#x394; = -1.92, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.77), Tinetti Balance and Gait Scale (Balance: &#x394; = 2.77, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.91), and Timed Up and Go test (&#x394; = -1.98, p < 0.0005, Cohen's d = 0.83). On the other hand, Group II, which received exercise only, exhibited substantial gains in the Tinetti Balance and Gait Scale (Walking: &#x394; = 0.52, p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.27) and Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (&#x394; = 5.77, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.26). These findings underscore the effectiveness of AOT-enhanced community-based exercises in enhancing both physical and cognitive performance among older adults facing social isolation during the pandemic, with Group I (AOT + exercise) showing particularly promising results.
