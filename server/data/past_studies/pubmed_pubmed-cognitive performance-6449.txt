Study Title: Effects of Folic Acid and Vitamin B12 Supplementation on Cognitive Impairment and Inflammation in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Randomized, Single-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the combined action of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation on cognitive performance and inflammation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients (n=120) diagnosed clinically as probable AD and in stable condition from Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cerebrovascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases. Individuals were randomly divided into the intervention group (n=60, folic acid 1.2 mg/d + vitamin B12 50 &#x3bc;g/d) and the placebo group (n=60). Cognitive performance, blood folate, vitamin B12, one carbon cycle metabolite, and inflammatory cytokine levels were measured at baseline and after 6 months. The data were analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measures. A total of 101 participants (51 in the intervention group and 50 in the placebo group) completed the trial. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 supplementation had a beneficial effect on the MoCA total scores (P=0.029), naming scores (P=0.013), orientation scores (P=0.004), and ADAS-Cog domain score of attention (P=0.008), as compared to those of the control subjects. Moreover, supplementation significantly increased plasma SAM (P<0.001) and SAM/SAH (P<0.001), and significantly decreased the levels of serum Hcy (P<0.001), plasma SAH (P<0.001), and serum TNF&#x3b1; (P<0.001) compared to in the control subjects. Folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation showed a positive therapeutic effect in AD patients who were not on a folic acid-fortified diet. The findings of this study help to delineate nutrient intervention as far as public health management for the prevention of dementia is concerned.
