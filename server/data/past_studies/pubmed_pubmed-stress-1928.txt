Study Title: Practical cooling interventions for preventing heat strain in indoor factory workers in Thailand.

Study Summary:
Occupational heat stress, exacerbated by factors such as climate change and insufficient cooling solutions, endangers the health and productivity of workers, especially in low-resource workplaces. To evaluate the effectiveness of two cooling strategies in reducing physiological strain and productivity of piece-rate workers over a 9-h work shift in a southern Thailand sawmill. In a crossover randomized control trial design, 12 (33&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7&#x2009;y; 1.58&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05&#x2009;m; 51&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9&#x2009;kg; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5 females) medically screened sawmill workers were randomly allocated into three groups comprising an established phase change material vest (VEST), an on-site combination cooling oasis (OASIS) (i.e., hydration, cold towels, fans, water dousing), and no cooling (CON) across 3 consecutive workdays. Physiological strain was measured via core temperature telemetry and heart rate monitoring. Productivity was determined by counting the number of pallets of wood sorted, stacked, and stowed each day. Relative to CON, OASIS lowered core temperature by 0.25&#xb0;C [95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.24, 0.25] and heart rate by 7 bpm [6, 9] bpm, compared to 0.17&#xb0;C [0.17, 0.18] and 10 [9,12] bpm reductions with VEST. It was inconclusive whether productivity was statistically lower in OASIS compared to CON (mean difference [MD]&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.5 [-0.2, 5.2]), and was not statistically different between VEST and CON (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.4 [-1.3, 4.1]). Both OASIS and VEST were effective in reducing physiological strain compared to no cooling. Their effect on productivity requires further investigation, as even small differences between interventions could lead to meaningful disparities in piece-rate worker earnings over time.
