Study Title: Efficacy of a Mobile Health App (eMOTIVA) Regarding Compliance With Cardiac Rehabilitation Guidelines in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease: Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Cardiac rehabilitation is fundamental among patients recovering from a coronary event, and mHealth technology may constitute a useful tool that provides guidelines based on scientific evidence in an entertaining, attractive, and user-friendly format. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of an mHealth intervention involving the eMOTIVA app and that of usual care regarding compliance with cardiac rehabilitation guidelines in terms of lifestyle, cardiovascular risk factors, and satisfaction among patients with acute coronary syndrome. A randomized controlled clinical trial with a parallel group design was conducted. It included 300 patients (mHealth group, 150; control group, 150) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome. Both groups underwent evaluations initially (during hospitalization) and after 3 and 6 months (face-to-face consultations). The eMOTIVA app incorporates a virtual classroom providing audio and video information about a healthy lifestyle, a section for self-recording cardiovascular risk factors, and a section for feedback messages and gamification. The primary outcome variables were (1) adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the frequency of consumption of food; (2) physical activity level, sedentary time, and exercise capacity; (3) smoking cessation and nicotine dependence; (4) level of knowledge about cardiovascular risk factors; and (5) app satisfaction and usability. The study analyzed 287 patients (mHealth group, 145; control group, 142). Most participants were male (207/300, 69.0%), and the mean age was 62.53 (SD 8.65) years. Significant improvements were observed in the mHealth group compared with the control group at 6 months in terms of (1) adherence to the Mediterranean diet (mean 11.92, SD 1.70 vs 8.92, SD 2.66 points; P<.001) and frequency of eating foods (red meat [&#x2264;1/week]: 141/143, 97.9% vs 96/141, 68.1%; industrial pastries [<2/week]: 129/143, 89.6% vs 80/141, 56.8%; oily fish [&#x2265;2/week]: 124/143, 86.1% vs 64/141, 41.4%; vegetables [&#x2265;2/day]: 130/143, 90.3% vs 78/141, 55.3%; fruit [&#x2265;2/day]: 128/143, 88.9% vs 85/141, 60.2%; all P<.001); (2) physical activity (mean 2112.66, SD 1196.67 vs 1372.60, SD 944.62 metabolic equivalents/week; P<.001) and sedentary time (mean 8.38, SD 1.88 vs 9.59, SD 2.09 hours; P<.001); (3) exercise capacity (distance: mean 473.49, SD 102.28 vs 447.25, SD 93.68 meters; P=.04); and (4) level of knowledge (mean 117.85, SD 3.83 vs 111.00, SD 7.11 points; P<.001). App satisfaction was high (mean 42.53, SD 6.38 points), and its usability was excellent (mean 95.60, SD 4.03 points). With the eMOTIVA app, favorable results were obtained in the intervention group in terms of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, frequency of eating certain foods, physical activity, sedentary time, exercise capacity, knowledge level, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar level. Furthermore, participants reported high app satisfaction and rated its usability as excellent. Thus, this innovative tool is very promising.
