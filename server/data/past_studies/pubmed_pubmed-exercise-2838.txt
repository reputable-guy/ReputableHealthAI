Study Title: Effects of photobiomodulation and an aerobic exercise on the level of pain and quality of life in women with fibromyalgia.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness of photobiomodulation (PBM) in conjunction with an aerobic exercise program (AEP) on the level of pain and quality of life of women with fibromyalgia (FM). A double-blinded randomized controlled trial in which 51 participants with FM were allocated into 4 groups: control group (CG) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12); active PBM group (APG) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12); AEP and placebo PBM group (EPPG) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13); AEP and active PBM group (EAPG) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14). AEP was performed on an ergometric bicycle; and a PBM (with an increase dosage regime) [20&#xa0;J, 32&#xa0;J and 40&#xa0;J] was applied using a cluster device. Both interventions were performed twice a week for 12 weeks. A mixed generalized model analysis was performed, evaluating the time (initial and final) and group (EAPG, EPPG, APG and CG) interaction. All analyses were based on intent-to-treat for a significance level of p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05. The intra-group analysis demonstrated that all treated groups presented a significant improvement in the level of pain and quality of life comparing the initial and final evaluation (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Values for SF-36 and 6-minute walk test increased significant in intragroup analysis for EPPG comparing the initial and final evaluation. No intergroup differences were observed. Both exercised and PBM irradiated volunteers present improvements in the variables analyzed. However, further studies should be performed, with other PBM parameters to determine the best regime of irradiation to optimize the positive effects of physical exercises in FM patients.
