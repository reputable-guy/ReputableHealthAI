Study Title: Role of relative-reinforcement value of alcohol-free activities during recovery from alcohol use disorder in an adult clinical sample.

Study Summary:
Behavioral economic theory has been extensively applied to understand alcohol use disorder (AUD). Applications of behavioral economic theory conceptualize AUD as a pattern of harmful alcohol use over extended periods of time in which choices between drinking or engaging in alcohol-free activities favor drinking. Recovery, in contrast, entails a sustained shift toward a pattern of selecting rewarding alcohol-free activities. The present study examined whether alcohol-free activity engagement and the relative-reinforcement value (RRV) of engaging in those activities predicted AUD treatment outcomes via secondary analysis of data from Project MATCH, a multisite randomized clinical trial examining behavioral treatments for AUD (= 1,279, 75.8% male, 81.0% non-Hispanic White, 9.5% Black, 7.7% Hispanic/Latino, 1.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, < 1% Asian American, and other race/ethnicity). Regression analyses indicated that every additional alcohol-free activity reported at 6 months posttreatment was associated with 7% fewer drinking days, 5% fewer heavy drinking days, and approximately one less drink per drinking day, as well as with significant improvements in depression, purpose in life, and psychosocial functioning at 12 months following treatment. Consistent with behavioral economic theory, higher RRV of alcohol-free activities also predicted significant reductions in drinking and improvements in functioning, and these associations were stronger compared to results for alcohol-free activity frequency only. The findings highlight the importance of understanding environmental contexts conducive to recovery and support the value of increasing alcohol-free activity engagement and the RRV of engaging in such activities to facilitate reductions in drinking and improved functioning among individuals with AUD.
