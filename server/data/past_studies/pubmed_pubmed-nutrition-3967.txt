Study Title: The Role of Nutrition in Cancer Prevention - Should You Listen to Your Doctor or Influencer?

Study Summary:
A significant proportion of cancers could be prevented by adopting healthy lifestyle behaviours. In addition, healthy lifestyle factors can have a positive impact on cancer outcomes and survival. Yet, most physicians, including oncologists, do not dedicate a significant amount of time addressing these factors with their patients, who instead look to mainstream media and other non-medical sources for information. This has led to an increase in the number of 'influencers' in the wellness space who can accumulate a large and captive audience. At times, this has caused friction amongst healthcare professionals who feel that 'influencers' may overstate the potential benefits. The reality is that most people, physicians and the public alike, fail to recognise the immense power that lifestyle interventions hold. Rather than shy away from addressing these issues, we should be empowering our patients to take back control over their health. Here, we provide a personal perspective on why addressing lifestyle factors within cancer care is so important and that we can indeed work together with 'influencers' to amplify the message.
