Study Title: Effects of high-intensity interval training combined with dual-site transcranial direct current stimulation on inhibitory control and working memory in healthy adults.

Study Summary:
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) have been demonstrated to enhance inhibitory control and working memory (WM) performance in healthy adults. However, the potential benefits of combining these two interventions have been rarely explored and remain largely speculative. This study aimed to explore the effects of acute HIIT combined with dual-site tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, F3 and F4) on inhibitory control and WM in healthy young adults. Twenty-five healthy college students (20.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;years; 11 females) were recruited to complete HIIT + tDCS, HIIT + sham-tDCS, rest + tDCS, and rest + sham-tDCS (CON) sessions in a randomized crossover design. tDCS or sham-tDCS was conducted after completing HIIT or a rest condition of the same duration. The Stroop and 2-back tasks were used to evaluate the influence of this combined intervention on cognitive tasks involving inhibitory control and WM performance in post-trials, respectively. Response times (RTs) of the Stroop task significantly improved in the HIIT + tDCS session compared to the CON session across all conditions (all p values <0.05), in the HIIT + tDCS session compared to the rest + tDCS session in the congruent and neutral conditions (all p values <0.05), in the HIIT + sham-tDCS session compared to the CON session in the congruent and neutral conditions (all p values <0.05), in the HIIT + sham-tDCS session compared to the rest + tDCS session in the congruent condition (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.015). No differences were found between sessions in composite score of RT and accuracy in the Stroop task (all p values >0.05) and in the 2-back task reaction time and accuracy (all p values >0.05). We conclude that acute HIIT combined with tDCS effectively improved inhibitory control but it failed to yield cumulative benefits on inhibitory control and WM in healthy adults. These preliminary findings help to identify beneficial effects of combined interventions on cognitive performance and might guide future research with clinical populations.
