Study Title: Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin treatment in COVID-19 is associated with faster resolution of symptoms: A randomized pilot clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Effective treatment to prevent hospitalization and death in people with COVID-19 exists, but people still need interventions that alleviate symptoms without drug interactions. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins (SBI) may reduce symptoms and time-to-improvement in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. In this randomized, open-label, single-site study, participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 received SBI 5.0&#x2009;g bis in die (BID)&#x2009;+&#x2009;Standard of Care (SOC) or SOC alone (2:1) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, 78.8% of hospitalized participants on SBI&#x2009;+&#x2009;SOC improved by World Health Organization (WHO) scale of &#x2265;3 compared to 61.1% on SOC alone (odds ratio: OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.4; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0663), with older participants (>57 years) showing more significant differences between the arms (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.1; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0109). Further, more participants on SBI&#x2009;+&#x2009;SOC reported absence of COVID-19 symptoms at Week 2 (74.2%) compared to SOC alone (43.6%; OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.7; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0031), most notably the absence of dyspnea on exertion (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.4; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0047), with women exhibiting the most significant eradication of all symptoms (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.8; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0080). No difference in change of IL-6 between arms was observed. Overall, participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 on SBI&#x2009;+&#x2009;SOC had a shorter time-to-recovery than on SOC alone, with a significantly higher rate of complete resolution of symptoms. Dyspnea on exertion was the symptom most significantly impacted. For people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, oral SBI could be a safe and effective intervention, devoid of drug interactions.
