Study Title: Efficacy of transcranial alternating current stimulation in treating chronic insomnia and the impact of age on its effectiveness: A multisite randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study.

Study Summary:
Insomnia is a significant health issue associated with various systemic diseases. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been proposed as a potential intervention for insomnia. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of tACS in chronic insomnia remain unclear. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of tACS in treating chronic insomnia in adults and assess the impact of age on its effectiveness using a large sample from two centers. A total of 120 participants with chronic insomnia underwent 20 daily sessions of tACS (duration: 40&#xa0;min, frequency: 77.5&#xa0;Hz, and intensity: 15&#xa0;mA) or sham tACS targeting the forehead and both mastoid areas over 4 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and 4-week follow-up. Primary outcomes included sleep quality and efficiency, onset latency, total sleep time, and daily disturbances. Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety, and clinical impression. Compared with the control group, the tACS group demonstrated improved sleep quality and efficiency, increased total sleep time, and reduced daily disturbance (all ps&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). Moreover, tACS had a significant effect on clinical impression (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), but not depression and anxiety scores. Subgroup analyses revealed that older participants experienced significant benefits from tACS in sleep quality, efficiency, and overall insomnia reduction at post-treatment and follow-up (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Notably, improved insomnia correlated with attenuated depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that tACS may be an effective intervention for chronic insomnia within an eight-week timeframe, and age affects the response to tACS in terms of insomnia improvement.
