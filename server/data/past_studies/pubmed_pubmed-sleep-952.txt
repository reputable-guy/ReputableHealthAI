Study Title: Veterans' lived experiences with the VA's Whole Health system and perceived impact on dimensions of wellness.

Study Summary:
What are the lived experiences and wellness related outcomes of veterans engaged in the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Whole Health (WH) system of care? This qualitative work was conducted with a pragmatic phenomenological approach to understand patients' lived experience within the WH system of care. Data were contextualized within a multi-dimensional wellness model. This descriptive quality improvement project used semi-structured telephone interviews. Interview script elicited veterans' WH participation experiences and perceived wellness related outcomes. Data were collected within a WH Service, at a large Veterans Health Administration Hospital in the Southeast United States. Data were collected with a purposive sample of veterans that participated in at least 2 WH activities. Patients were recruited by WH clinical team collaborators to participate in qualitative data collection. Rapid content analysis and interpretation of results were conducted in alignment with dimensions of wellness constructs. WH offers veterans' non-pharmacological tools to improve mental, physical, and social wellness. Participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;50) represented the larger veteran population. Most veterans perceived a positive WH experience with improvement of three primary dimensions including mental and emotional, physical, and social wellness - impacts on other dimensions gleaned less perceived impact. Veterans reported adopting mindfulness and coping strategies, better mobility, pain management, and sleep quality, and enhanced social engagement. Even those who did benefit personally from all aspects of WH, felt the services are needed to support the larger veteran population. Reduced suicidal ideation and pain medication use emerged as a WH effect among approximately 10% of the sample.
