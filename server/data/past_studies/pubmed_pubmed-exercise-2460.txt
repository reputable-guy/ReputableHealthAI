Study Title: Local and non-local effects (on the posterior chain) of four weeks of foot exercises: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the local, remote, and contralateral effects of a four-week intrinsic foot muscle exercise intervention in recreationally active participants on foot parameters, flexibility, and performance of the posterior chain (PC). Twenty-eight healthy participants (12f, 16m) were randomly assigned to a control group or performed 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;6&#xa0;min of foot exercises twice daily&#xa0;unilaterally at least five days/week for four weeks. At baseline (M1), after the intervention (M2), and after a four-week wash-out period (M3), we assessed bilateral Foot Posture Index-6, medial longitudinal arch mobility, single-leg stance balance, range of motion (ROM) (first metatarsophalangeal joint and ankle), and&#xa0;flexibility and performance of the PC. The FPI-6 score changes over time differed significantly between groups for both legs, improving by 26% in the trained- (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) and 11% in the untrained leg (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02) in the intervention group from M1 to M2. Improvements were maintained at M3 for the trained leg (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02). Ankle range of motion and balance of the trained leg improved from M1 to M2, yet only became significant at M3 (ROM: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02; balance: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007). The other parameters did not change significantly. A four-week foot exercise intervention might have local but no remote effects in healthy young adults.German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00027923) (24/08/2022).
