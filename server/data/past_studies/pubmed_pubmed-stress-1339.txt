Study Title: Effect of Motor Interference Therapy on Distress Related to Traumatic Memories: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Feasibility Trial.

Study Summary:
Traumatic memories (TM) are a core feature of stress-related disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatment is often difficult, and specific pharmacological interventions are lacking. We present a novel non-pharmacological intervention called motor interference therapy (MIT) as a promising alternative for these symptoms. To determine the feasibility of MIT, a brief, audio-delivered, and non-pharmacological intervention that uses cognitive and motor tasks to treat TM. We designed a randomized, double-blind trial. Twenty-eight participants from an outpatient clinic with at least one TM were included to receive either MIT or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Spanish versions of the PTSD symptom severity scale (EGS), visual analog scale for TM (TM-VAS), and quality of life (EQ-VAS) were applied prior to intervention, 1 week, and 1 month following intervention. Mean scores on all measures improved from baseline to posttest for both groups. MIT participants showed significantly more positive scores at 1 week and 1 month (TM-VAS baseline: 9.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.4; immediate: 6.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.0; 1 week: 3.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.1 [d&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.57]; 1 month 2.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.8 [d&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.93]) than PMR participants on measures of distress due to TM, trauma re-experiencing, anxiety, and a composite measure of PTSD. MIT is a simple, effective, and easy-to-use tool for treating TM and other stress-related symptoms. It requires relatively few resources and could be adapted to many contexts. The results provide proof-of-principle support for conducting future research with larger cohorts and controls to improve clinical effectiveness and research on brief interventions.
