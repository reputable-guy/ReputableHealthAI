Study Title: Mindfulness and Sex Education for Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder: Mediators and Moderators of Treatment Outcome.

Study Summary:
Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) is a common sexual dysfunction in women. Both mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) plus psychoeducation and sex therapy, education, and support (STEP; which contains the same educational information as in the MBCT arm but also integrates supportive-expressive therapy), are effective. We tested mediators and moderators of improvements. Each treatment arm consisted of eight sessions delivered weekly, and participants completed measures online pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month post-treatment. Depression, self-reported interoceptive awareness, self-compassion, self-criticism, and mindfulness were examined as mediators, and expectations for improvement as a moderator. Of 148 cisgender women who consented, 70 were randomized to the MBCT plus psychoeducation group (mean age 39.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13.2&#x2009;yrs) and 78 to the STEP group (mean age 37.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;12.2&#x2009;yrs). Decreases in depression mediated decreases in sexual distress in the MBCT plus psychoeducation group only. Improvements in interoceptive awareness mediated changes in both sexual desire and arousal, and sexual distress, and to a greater degree after MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in self-compassion mediated changes in sexual desire and arousal only for the MBCT plus psychoeducation group and mediated changes in sexual distress in both groups. Reductions in self-criticism mediated improvements in sexual distress to a greater extent after MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in mindfulness predicted changes in desire and arousal, and distress only in the MBCT plus psychoeducation group. Expectations for improvement did not moderate any outcomes. The findings have implications for understanding common and potentially distinct pathways by which MBCT plus psychoeducation and supportive sex education improve symptoms of SIAD.
