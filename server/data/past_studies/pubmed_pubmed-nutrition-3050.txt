Study Title: Comparison of n-3 PUFA-Enriched vs. Olive-Oil-Based Lipid Emulsion on Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Response in Critically Ill Post-Surgery Adults: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition in critically ill patients represents a major concern as it can lead to adverse outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality. These patients exhibit an impaired immune response accompanied by increased oxidative stress. Nutritional support, including parenteral nutrition (PN), is critical in these patients. Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs), a key component of PN, provide energy and intervene in the modulation of inflammation. This was a secondary study of a randomized clinical trial at the Reina Sofia University Hospital (Murcia, Spain) for critically ill patients following major abdominal surgery that were administered PN supplemented with olive-oil-based ILE (OO-ILE,= 29) or a mixed-lipid ILE (soybean oil, medium chain triglycerides, OO and fish oil, SMOF-ILE,= 25). The effects on clinical outcomes, metabolic markers, oxidative stress, and inflammation were evaluated. No significant differences were observed between groups in the clinical parameters and outcomes, oxidative stress, or inflammatory markers. The within-group evaluation demonstrated an increase in total antioxidant capacity in both groups, while OO-ILE increased the levels of 15-F2t-isoprostane. In addition, the results showed that both mixtures reduced the release of IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-6. These findings suggest that both treatments had similar effects on oxidative stress and inflammatory response in this type of patient.
