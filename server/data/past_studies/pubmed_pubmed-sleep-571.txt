Study Title: Physical and Psychological Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers, Including End of Life Care Providers.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic has not only caused unprecedented distress in the community but has also resulted in significant physical and psychological exhaustion among healthcare workers (HCWs). This exhaustion could potentially lead to serious effects on our healthcare system. The aim of this study was to gain more insight on the effect of COVID-19 on burnout among oncologists and other healthcare professionals at a large academic center. A 10-minute electronic questionnaire was distributed to actively employed physicians, APRNs, and PAs affiliated with the University of Miami. The survey encompassed a range of personal and professional characteristics, including stress related to COVID-19. The survey was distributed to a total of 739 HCWs, with 182 respondents (24.6%) completing the entire survey. The impact of the pandemic on these professionals included increased workload (59.5%), reduced leadership opportunities (32.2%), job insecurity (28.6%), and rescheduling of professional activities (22.2%). Out of the 182 respondents, 70 were primarily from the fields of Oncology and Palliative Care. Several factors have contributed to increased physical and psychological stress among HCWs, such as extended working hours, sleep deprivation, job insecurity, the shift to telemedicine, the risk of contracting the virus and endangering their families, lack of childcare options, and the added pressure of homeschooling. This study serves as a foundation for more comprehensive research aimed at elucidating and guiding the development of wellness programs crucial for the overall well-being of HCWs.
