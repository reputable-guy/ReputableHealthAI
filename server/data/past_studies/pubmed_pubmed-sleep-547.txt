Study Title: The effects of aromatherapy massage in menopausal women with knee osteoarthritis: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Knee Osteoarthritis (OA)'s prevalence increases during menopause. Aromatherapy massage with different oils is applied in the treatment of knee OA. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of aromatherapy massage with Bergamot essential oil (BEO) on pain, functionality, sleep quality and menopausal symptoms in menopausal women with knee OA. This study included 60 menopausal participants diagnosed with grade II-III OA. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: BEO (n=20), placebo (n=20) and control (n=20). The participants in the BEO group, received aromatherapy massage with BEO, in the placebo group aromatherapy massage with sweet almond oil was applied twice a week for 4 weeks. All participants underwent conventional physiotherapy. Visual Analog Scale was used to assess the severity of pain, Osteoarthritis Index to assess functionality, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality and Menopausal Symptoms Rating Scale to assess menopausal symptoms. All measurements were performed before and after the study. The results of the study showed that all three groups were effective on pain, functionality, sleep quality and menopausal symptoms (p<0.001). The results of the study showed that, aromatherapy massage with BEO was found to be more effective on functionality (p<0.001), pain (p<0.001) and menopausal symptoms (somatic and psychological symptoms) (p<0.001) compared to the control and placebo groups. It was determined that aromatherapy massage with BEO did not create a significant difference between the sleep quality scale scores in the control group and the placebo group (p=0.454). This study found that aromatherapy massage with BEO improved functionality, reduced pain and menopausal symptoms, and did not affect sleep quality. We consider that its application in addition to routine treatment may be useful to reduce symptoms.
