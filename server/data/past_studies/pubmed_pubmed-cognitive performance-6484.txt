Study Title: Different neurocognitive profiles of risperidone and aripiprazole in the FIRST episode of psychosis: A 3-year follow-up comparison.

Study Summary:
Cognitive deficits have been recognized as a central feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. These deficits are often related to more severe negative symptoms, as well as a poorer adjustment in social functioning. Therefore, it is important to improve cognitive performance from the onset of the disease. In this study, we compared the effects of two atypical antipsychotics, risperidone and aripiprazole, on cognition. The data used in the present investigation were obtained from a large epidemiological cohort of patients with a first episode of psychosis who were treated in a longitudinal intervention programme. The patients included in the program were randomized to treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole and were assessed for cognitive function at baseline and 3&#xa0;years later. The final sample consisted of 115 patients, 55 of whom were initially assigned to risperidone and 60 to aripiprazole. The groups did not show significant differences in their sociodemographic or clinical characteristics at intake. Longitudinal analyses showed that risperidone-treated patients improved in the processing speed domain at the 3-year follow-up, while the aripiprazole group showed better scores for the executive function domain. Our study shows slight differences between the effects of risperidone and aripiprazole on cognition, suggesting different patterns of efficacy on cognitive function that may warrant more thorough research to determine the beneficial effects of these drugs on cognition. Future studies should evaluate the effects of these treatments over longer follow-up periods using standardized tools for the assessment of cognitive function.
