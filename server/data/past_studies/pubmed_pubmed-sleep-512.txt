Study Title: Psychological aspects of the longest, solo, unsupported one-way polar ski expedition in Antarctica by a female adventurer.

Study Summary:
Antarctic expeditions present exceptional physiological and mental challenges. Research data are lacking on psychological aspects of such endeavours. The aim of our study is to provide data on changes in mood, well-being, personality traits and personal experiences during an Antarctica crossing. This is a study of a 33-year-old female British Army officer (height 175 cm; weight 75 kg; body mass index 24.49 kg/m; VO49 mL/kg/min) who completed the longest, solo, unsupported, one-way polar ski expedition. The expedition started at Hercules Inlet and finished at Ross Ice Shelf, lasting 70 days and 16 hours covering 1484.53 km, with temperatures estimating from -12&#xb0;C to -50&#xb0;C and wind speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. The adventurer pulled all equipment and nutrition in a pulk (sled), weighing approximately 120 kg. Five psychometric questionnaires were completed pre post and during the expedition, including the International Personality Item Pool - Neuroticism, Extraversion and Openness-60, Brief Assessment of Mood, Positive and Negative Affective Schedule, Profile of Mood States, Wellness questionnaire, as well as an unstructured open questionnaire. Mood generally deteriorated, particularly positive affective mood. Scores for fatigue and muscle soreness increased, with a reduction in sleep times. Personality traits of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness remained stable throughout the expedition, with some reduction in extraversion and an increase in neuroticism. Personal accounts give a unique insight into the increasing demands on the mental and physical impact of the expedition. Meticulous preparation and planning may have led to a successful expedition, including physical preparation, prior on-field experience, and psychological preparedness and resiliance. Some of these strategies may be applicable to a range of settings, including future Antarctic expeditions, expeditions in extreme environments, or missions within a military context.
