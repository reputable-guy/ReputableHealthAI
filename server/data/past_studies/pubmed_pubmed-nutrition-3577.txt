Study Title: Roux-en-Y versus one-anastomosis gastric bypass (RYSA study): weight loss, metabolic improvements, and nutrition at 1&#x2009;year after surgery, a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Although it has been suggested that one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is metabolically superior to the "gold standard," i.e., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), there is little robust evidence to prove it. Because this result may arise from the typically longer length of bypassed intestine in OAGB, here, the authors standardized the bypass length in RYGB and OAGB and compared weight loss and metabolic outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. The authors randomized 121 bariatric patients to RYGB (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;61) or OAGB (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) in two Finnish University Hospitals and measured weight; body composition; metabolic features (insulin sensitivity, lipids, inflammation, nutrition); and comorbidities before and 6 and 12&#x2009;months after the operation. Total weight loss was similar in RYGB and OAGB at 6&#x2009;months (mean: 21.2% [95% CI: 19.4-23.0] vs. 22.8% [95% CI: 21.5-24.1], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.136) and 12&#x2009;months (25.4% [95% CI: 23.4-27.5] vs. 26.1% [95% CI: 24.2-28.9], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.635). Insulin sensitivity, lipids, and inflammation improved similarly between the groups (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Remission of type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia was marked and similar (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05) but the use of antihypertensive medications was lower (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037) and hypertension tended to improve more (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.053) with RYGB versus OAGB at 12&#x2009;months. Higher rates of vitamin D-25 deficiency (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and lower D-25 levels were observed with OAGB versus RYGB throughout the follow-up (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). No differences in adverse effects were observed. RYGB and OAGB were comparable in weight loss, metabolic improvement, remission of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, and nutrition at 1-year follow-up. Vitamin D-25 deficiency was more prevalent with OAGB, whereas reduction in antihypertensive medications and hypertension was greater with RYGB. There is no need to change the current practices of RYGB in favor of OAGB.
