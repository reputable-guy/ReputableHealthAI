Study Title: Smartband-based smoking detection and real-time brief mindfulness intervention: findings from a feasibility clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Smartbands can be used to detect cigarette smoking and deliver real time smoking interventions. Brief mindfulness interventions have been found to reduce smoking. This single arm feasibility trial used a smartband to detect smoking and deliver brief mindfulness exercises. Daily smokers who were motivated to reduce their smoking wore a smartband for 60 days. For 21 days, the smartband monitored, detected and notified the user of smoking in real time. After 21 days, a 'mindful smoking' exercise was triggered by detected smoking. After 28 days, a 'RAIN' (recognize, allow, investigate, nonidentify) exercise was delivered to predicted smoking. Participants received mindfulness exercises by text message and online mindfulness training. Feasibility measures included treatment fidelity, adherence and acceptability. Participants (N=155) were 54% female, 76% white non-Hispanic, and treatment starters (n=115) were analyzed. Treatment fidelity cutoffs were met, including for detecting smoking and delivering mindfulness exercises. Adherence was mixed, including moderate smartband use and low completion of mindfulness exercises. Acceptability was mixed, including high helpfulness ratings and mixed user experiences data. Retention of treatment starters was high (81.9%). Findings demonstrate the feasibility of using a smartband to track smoking and deliver quit smoking interventions contingent on smoking.
