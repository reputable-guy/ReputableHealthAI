Study Title: Effects of Aromatherapy on Pain, Stress, and Behaviors of Newborns: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study was conducted as a randomized controlled double-blind trial to examine the effects of massage and bathing using lavender oil on the pain, stress, and behavior of newborns. It was hypothesized that the interventions would be associated with changes in pain, stress, and behavior in newborns. The sample of the study included 45 term newborns (15 lavender massage groups, 15 lavender bath groups, 15 control groups). Newborns with a postnatal age of 1-5 days and a gestational age of 38-42 weeks, who could tolerate enteral nutrients, were not connected to a respiratory support device, had no skin disease, had no genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, did not undergo surgical intervention, and at least one parent giving written consent were included in the study. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, repeated measures ANOVA, and one-way ANOVA tests were used to evaluate the data. It was determined that the Neonatal Pain and Stress Rating Scale scores of the newborns in the lavender massage group decreased at the 5th minute after the study compared to before the study. It was determined that the Anderson Behavior Status Scoring System scores of the newborns in the lavender massage group decreased at the 5th minute after the study compared to before the study. It was also determined that the mean difference between the Neonatal Pain and Stress Rating Scale scores of the newborns in the lavender massage group was higher than the other groups. Aromatherapy massage with lavender oil is more effective in reducing pain and stress levels and improving behavioral outcomes in newborns than a bath application using lavender oil.
