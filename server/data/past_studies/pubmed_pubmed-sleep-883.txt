Study Title: Using the Paired Sample t test to Analyze the Effect of Jogging on the Cardiovascular Function of College Students.

Study Summary:
In China, there have been instances of sudden cardiac death among university students, with a significant number of students being at risk of cardiovascular diseases. This risk is often attributed to sub-health conditions such as weight gain and obesity, which are triggered by sedentary lifestyles, irregular living habits, and unregulated diets. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the guidance for participation in physical activities, encouraging students to actively reduce their risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Jogging, characterized by its convenience, simplicity, and low-risk participation, has been widely accepted by university students. This study takes the impact of jogging on the cardiovascular function of university students as a starting point. It aims to explore the content of the changing process suitable for the development of cardiovascular function in university students. The ultimate goal is to promote the healthy development of the cardiovascular system function in university students and improve their adherence to physical activities. The study recruited 60 university students with no exercise habits through on-campus poster advertisements. These 60 participants were randomly divided into two groups. The students in the experimental group were required to jog no less than three times a week, with each session lasting at least 30 minutes. The organizers of the experiment would remind the students daily in a WeChat group to complete their weekly exercise plan and persist in jogging, promoting the benefits of this activity. During jogging, the students used the Keep mobile application to record their jogging time and heart rate, which they then uploaded to the WeChat group. Follow-ups were conducted with students who did not complete their exercise plan, providing encouragement and guidance to continue participating in the experiment. The study employed a comparative research approach between the experimental group and the control group. According to the experimental protocol, after 12 weeks of jogging intervention, the cardiovascular health indicators of both male and female students in the experimental group showed positive changes. Measurements of cardiac function indicators in the experimental group of boys SPTI, DPTI, ED has decreased, SEVR has increased, the relevant indicators compared with the relevant indicators of the control group (P < .05) is significant; in the experimental group of girls, SPTI, DPTI, SEVR indicators decreased, ED increased, and compared with the relevant indicators of the control group (P < .01) has a very significant significance. Changes in vascular indicators in the experimental and control groups after the experiment, SBP, DBP, PP, CAP decreased in the experimental group, and DBP, CAP in the male and female groups were found to be (P < .01), with highly significant changes; while SBP, PP intergroup comparison (P < .05), with significant changes. Jogging is a good aerobic exercise program characterized by convenient ways of carrying out simple methods and low risk of participation. The benefits of jogging are not only reflected physiologically but also psychologically; it can make participants enhance their self-confidence and make their moods more pleasant. It can also improve sleep quality and maintain a good mental state. Long-term jogging habits can effectively improve endothelial function and heart contraction function, reduce blood pressure effectively prevent atherosclerosis and prevent CVD by reducing the incidence of CVD risk factors.
