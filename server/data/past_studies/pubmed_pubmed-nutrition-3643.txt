Study Title: Anticancer assessment and antibiofilm potential ofmushroom originated from Serbia.

Study Summary:
(Bull.) Murrill is a well-known edible mushroom consumed in nutrition as delicacy. It has been used in traditional medicine because of its beneficial effects on human wellness, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer potential. The present study determined the phenolic profile ofethanolic extract (LSE) by high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Tolerance of two probiotic bacterial strains229v,subsp.and probiotic yeaston LSE was analyzed in terms of viability and biofilm formation. Effects of extract on colorectal (HCT-116) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells viability was determined using MTT test in concentration range: 1-500&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/mL after 24 and 72&#x2009;h. Redox parameters (superoxide anion radicals, nitrites, and reduced glutathione) were evaluated using NBT, Griess, and GSH assays in the concentration range of 1-500&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/mL after 24 and 72&#x2009;h. Antimigratory activity was determined by wound healing method using selected concentrations of 10 and 50&#x2009;&#x3bc;g/mL after 24&#x2009;h. Untreated cells were considered as control. As control cell line, we used healthy fibroblasts (MRC-5). Our results demonstrated abundance of LSE in phenolics, with rosmarinic acid as the main component. LSE induced low tolerance of tested planktonic probiotic strains, with no affection on their ability to form biofilm. No significant cytotoxicity on tested cancer cells was observed, with prooxidative and antimigratory effects noticed. Extract exerted significant antimigratory activity on cancer cells without effect on planktonic and probiotic cultures in biofilm. These results indicate potential application ofethanolic extract as natural protector of probiotics with prominent ability to suppress cancer cell motility.
