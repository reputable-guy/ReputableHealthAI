Study Title: Effects of an online program about intimate and romantic relationships for people with mental disorders (AIRIKI): a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The concept of recovery has become internationally widespread. To promote personal recovery of individuals with mental disorders, it is important that they live life on their own terms. Many people with mental disorders wish to build intimate relationships and marry. However, people with mental disorders face obstacles in building such relationships and communicating with their partners. The program AIRIKI, which means "power to love," was developed to help people with mental disorders gain confidence in building intimate relationships. The AIRIKI pilot study with one-group pre post test showed positive effects on self-esteem, hope, and communication. Therefore, the purpose of the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the effects of the videoconferencing program on self-esteem, hope, and self-confidence in communication among un-married people with mental disorders. The proposed randomized controlled trial has two arms (intervention group and control group). After baseline questionnaire assessment, participants will be allocated randomly. Within two months of allocation, the intervention group will participate in videoconferences about intimate relationships and marriage with 2-5 participants and 3 facilitators, which will last 3&#xa0;h, for two days. Three facilitators will support participants in each session. The intervention group will complete a questionnaire for outcome assessment at termination and one month after the program. The control group will complete the outcome questionnaire at one month after baseline and two months after baseline. The questionnaire will include the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Herth Hope Index (HHI), and Self-confidence in Communication Scale (SCS). Control group members can participate in a videoconference program, which will be held separately from the intervention group, after completing their outcome assessments. This trial is the first randomized controlled trial of which we are aware to test the effects of an online program for un-married people with mental disorders to consider and discuss their romantic relationship and marriage. The results will provide information on the effectiveness of an online program for people with mental disorders to imagine their romantic relationships and marriages. This trial has been registered with the UNIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000052027; 2023/08/28).
