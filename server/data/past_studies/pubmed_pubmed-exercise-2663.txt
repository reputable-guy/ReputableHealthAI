Study Title: Effectiveness of virtual-walking intervention combined with exercise on improving pain and function in incomplete spinal cord injury: a feasibility study.

Study Summary:
A feasibility pilot study. To assess the feasibility a full-scale Randomized Controlled Trial aimed at assessing the beneficial effect of a Virtual Walking (VW)-based (Experimental intervention (EI)) on neuropathic pain and functionality in people with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). A hospital service (Hospital Universitario y Polit&#xe9;cnico La Fe) and disability associations (TetraSport, CODIFIVA and ASPAYM). Twelve people with chronic incomplete SCI were randomized to EI (VW plus therapeutic exercise program (TE)) -or Control Intervention (CI (placebo VW and TE)) groups. A six-week intervention (3 sessions/week) was carried out. To assess feasibility, the following outcomes were used: level of restriction and validity of inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants' compliance, accessibility and acceptability of the intervention for participants, adequate pre-training time of physiotherapists. To explore therapy effectiveness, pain severity, and interference, mean and maximum isometric strength, walking speed, and walking ability were assessed before (Time 1, T1) and after (Time 2, T2) the intervention. 20% of the participants initially recruited did not meet inclusion criteria. In addition, all participants completed at least 80% of the intervention sessions and none of the participants dropped out before T2. No serious adverse event was found. Moreover, 91.67% of participants were willing to perform the intervention again and all therapists involved were adequately pre-trained. Finally, our preliminary results suggest that the proposed EI is effective. A full-scale RCT is feasible and preliminary results suggest that VW with TE could have a beneficial impact on pain and functionality in this population.
