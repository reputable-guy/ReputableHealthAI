Study Title: Effect of One Night of Nocturnal Oxygen Supplementation on Highland Patients With OSA: A Randomized, Crossover Trial.

Study Summary:
The treatment of OSA in highland residents is not established. Does nocturnal oxygen supplementation (NOS) improve sleep-related breathing disturbances, nocturnal oxygenation, and cognitive performance in patients with OSA living at 3,200 m? Forty patients with OSA permanently living in Shangri-La, China at 3,200&#xa0;m (median age [interquartile range], 47.0 [44.0-53.0] years; oxygen desaturation index, 38.4/h [34.2/h-52.3/h]), were randomly assigned to receive nasal NOS and sham oxygen (ambient air), for one night each, at 2 L/min, in a crossover design, separated by a washout period of 2&#xa0;weeks. During treatment nights polysomnography was performed, and further outcomes were evaluated the next morning. The primary outcome was the difference in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between nights with NOS and nights with sham oxygen. During nights with sham oxygen, the median (interquartile range) total AHI was 43.4/h (31.1/h-67.5/h), the obstructive AHI was 41.9/h (28.5/h-66.8/h), and the central AHI was 0.6/h (0.1/h-1.3/h); blood oxygenation as determined by pulse oximetry (Spo) was 87.0%&#xa0;(84.5%-89.0%). In intention-to-treat analysis, NOS decreased the total AHI by a median of 17.9/h (95%&#xa0;CI, 8.0/h-27.1/h; P&#xa0;< .001), through a reduction in obstructive AHI by 16.0/h (95%&#xa0;CI, 6.8/h-26.0/h; P&#xa0;< .001) and central AHI by 0.4/h (95%&#xa0;CI, 0.1/h-0.9/h; P&#xa0;< .001). NOS also increased Spoby 7.0%&#xa0;(95%&#xa0;CI, 6.0%-8.0%; P&#xa0;< .001). Heart rate during sleep and pulse rate in the morning after NOS were significantly reduced, but subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance showed no changes. In highland residents with OSA, NOS significantly improved sleep-related breathing disturbances and nocturnal oxygenation. NOS also reduced heart rate during sleep and morning pulse rate. If these beneficial effects are confirmed in longer term studies, NOS may be a treatment option for highland patients with OSA who cannot be treated by CPAP.
