Study Title: The effect of Baduanjin on body mass and body composition of college students: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Previous studies have also found that Baduanjin training can improve health-related physical fitness in young adults. However, it is unclear whether Baduanjin training can improve body mass and body composition in young adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the Baduanjin training on body mass and body composition in college students. This was a single-center, randomized controlled trial comparing 12 weeks of Baduanjin exercise training group (BEG) at a frequency of 60 minutes per day, 4 days per week with no special exercise control group (CG) on the health-related physical fitness in college students. Body mass and body composition were assessed using the body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and Inbody 720 devices. A total of 93 college students (56 in the BEG and 37 in the CG) completed 2 body composition assessments and were included in the analysis. A mixed linear model was used to analyze the effect of the Baduanjin exercise intervention. After 12 weeks of intervention, the body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio in the BEG were significantly lower than that in the CG (P =.007 and P =.028) with a moderate effect size (Cohen d = 0.584 and 0.474) and a significant interaction effect of group by time (P =.007 and.028). The fat mass indicators of body composition including percent body fat, body fat mass, and body fat mass of both arms, both legs and trunk in the BEG were significantly lower than those in the CG (all P <.05), with a moderate effect size (Cohen d from 0.452 to 0.624) and a significant interaction effect of group by time (all P <.05); no significant differences were found in the total body composition indicators and the fat-free mass indicators of body composition between the 2 groups. Regular Baduanjin exercise training may be beneficial for improving body composition in young adults.
