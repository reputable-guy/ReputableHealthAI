Study Title: A Voice-Activated Device Exercise and Social Engagement Program for Older Adult-Care Partner Dyads: Pilot Clinical Trial and Focus Group Study Evaluating the Feasibility, Use, and Estimated Functional Impact of EngAGE.

Study Summary:
Maintaining exercise is essential for healthy aging but difficult to sustain. EngAGE is a socially motivated exercise program delivered over a voice-activated device that targets older adult-care partner dyads. This 10-week pilot study aimed to assess EngAGE feasibility and use, obtain user experience feedback, and estimate potential impact on function. In total, 10 older adults aged &#x2265;65 years were recruited from an independent living residence together with their self-identified care partners. EngAGE delivered National Institute on Aging Go4Life exercises to older adults daily, while care partners received progress reports and prompts to send encouraging messages that were read aloud by the device to the older adult. Older adults' use was tracked, and physical function was assessed at baseline and follow-up. Follow-up focus group data provided qualitative feedback. On average, participants completed 393.7 individual exercises over the 10-week intervention period or 39.4 exercises/wk (range 48-492, median 431, IQR 384-481, SD 112.4) without injury and used EngAGE on an average of 41 of 70 days or 4.1 d/wk (range 7-66, median 51, IQR 23-56, and SD 21.2 days). Mean grip strength increased nonsignificantly by 1.3 kg (preintervention mean 26.3 kg, SD 11.0; postintervention mean 27.6 kg, SD 11.6; P=.34), and 4 of 10 participants improved by a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 2.5 kg. Further, the time for 5-repeated chair stands significantly reduced by 2.3 seconds (preintervention mean 12, SD 3.6 s; postintervention mean 9.7, SD 2.7 s; P=.02), and 3 of 9 participants improved by an MCID of -2.3 seconds. Furthermore, 3-meter usual walk performance was brisk at baseline (mean 2.1, SD 0.4 s) and decreased by 0.1 seconds (postintervention 2, SD 0.4 s; P=.13), although 5 of 9 participants improved by a MCID of 0.05 m/s. Qualitative results showed perceived benefits, favored program features, and areas for improvement. We present a pilot study of a new voice-activated device application customized to older adult users that may serve as a guide to other technology development for older adults. Our pilot study served to further refine the application and to inform a larger trial testing EngAGE's impact on functional outcomes, a necessary step for developing evidence-based technology tools.
