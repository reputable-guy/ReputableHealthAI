Study Title: The efficacy of curcumin supplementation on serum total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, and disease activity in women with rheumatoid arthritis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the physiopathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is associated with impaired antioxidant defenses. This study aimed to investigate the effects of curcumin supplementation on serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and disease activity in women with RA. In this clinical trial, 48 women with RA were treated with one capsule of curcumin (500&#x2009;mg daily) or placebo for 8&#x2009;weeks. Anthropometric measurements and fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and end of the study. Finally, we assessed the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS-28), dietary intake, and physical activity levels. While curcumin supplementation for 8&#x2009;weeks significantly increased the serum levels of TAC (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), it decreased tender joint counts, swollen joint counts, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and DAS-28 compared to the placebo at the end of the study (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001 for all). MDA levels significantly decreased in the curcumin group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). However, changes in MDA concentration were not significant between groups at the end of the trial (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.145). Curcumin supplementation had a beneficial effect on increasing the serum levels of TAC and decreased DAS-28 in women with RA.
