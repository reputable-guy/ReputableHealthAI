Study Title: Effect of remote ischemic preconditioning intervention on serum levels of microRNA-582-5p/HMGB1 in patients with acute cerebral infarction.

Study Summary:
Acute cerebral infarction (ACI) contributes to disability and death accross the globe. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) reduces cerebral infarct size and improves neurological function in ACI. We conducted this research to reveal the effects of RIPC intervention on serum levels of microRNA-582-5p (miR-582-5p)/high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), inflammation, oxidative stress and neurological function in patients with ACI. In this study, 158 patients with ACI were prospectively selected and randomized into the control (administered symptomatic medication alone) and the RIPC (underwent RIPC of the limbs based on medication) groups, with their clinical baseline data documented. Serum levels of miR-582-5p, and HMGB1 and inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;)/interleukin-1beta (IL-1&#x3b2;)/IL-10] were assessed by RT-qPCR/ELISA, followed by comparisons of oxidative stress indices [glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px)/catalase (CAT)/superoxide dismutase (SOD)] using a fully automatic biochemical analyzer. Correlations between serum miR-582-5p with serum HMGB1, and between their levels with TNF-&#x3b1;/IL-1&#x3b2;/IL-10 were analyzed by Pearson analysis. The NIHSS score/Barthel Index scale were used to assess neurological function/daily living ability. Intervention safety for ACI patients was evaluated. RIPC intervention increased serum miR-582-5p levels and decreased serum HMGB1 levels in ACI patients. RIPC intervention significantly reduced inflammation (diminished TNF-&#x3b1;/IL-1&#x3b2; levels, increased IL-10 level) and oxidative stress (elevated GSH-Px/CAT/SOD levels) in ACI patients. Serum miR-582-5p was negatively correlated with TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2; levels, while positively correlated with IL-10 level, while HMGB1 was positively correlated with TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2; levels, while negatively correlated with IL-10 level. miR-582-5p was negatively correlated with HMGB1. RIPC intervention improved neurological function (reduced NIHSS, increased Barthel scores) in ACI patients to some extent. RIPC had certain effectiveness and safety in the treatment of ACI. After RIPC intervention, serum miR-582-5p levels were increased, HMGB1 levels were decreased, and inflammation and oxidative stress were reduced in ACI patients, which mitigated neurological deficits, improved patients' ability to perform life activities, and exerted neuroprotective effects to some extent.
