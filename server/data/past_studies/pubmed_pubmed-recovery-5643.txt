Study Title: Patient Satisfaction with Nonopioid Postoperative Analgesia in Head and Neck Surgery: A Prospective Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate patients' satisfaction with opioid versus opioid-sparing postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing outpatient head and neck surgery. Prospective randomized trial. Tertiary care academic hospital. Adult patients undergoing outpatient head and neck surgery were randomly assigned to 1 of 3&#xa0;analgesic regimens. First- and second-line medications were the following by group (1) Hydrocodone-acetaminophen with ibuprofen, (2) ibuprofen with hydrocodone-acetaminophen, and (3) ibuprofen with acetaminophen. Preoperative counseling was provided to patients regarding expected pain and proper medication use. Postoperative questionnaires were administered to assess satisfaction. One hundred three patients were enrolled in the study (mean age, 56.5 years; women, 75 [73%]). The mean satisfaction score with the pain regimen assigned was similar between the 3 groups (scale 0-10, [7.7, 8.3, 8.5, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.46]). A similar percentage of patients in each group reported that surgery was more painful than anticipated (25%, 32%, 26%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.978), and a similar percentage of patients reported willingness to utilize the same analgesic regimen following future surgeries (75%, 83%, 76%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.682). Additional questions evaluating the side effect profile, maximum and minimum pain scores, and difficulty of recovery were not statistically different between the 3&#xa0;groups. In the postoperative population for outpatient head and neck surgeries, there was no significant difference in patient satisfaction and pain control between the opioid and nonopioid arms. Providers should discuss opioid-sparing regimens preoperatively with patients and describe them as effective in providing adequate pain control without a significant impact on patient's perception of care.
