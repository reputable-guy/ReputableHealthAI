Study Title: Altered blood parameters in "major depression" patients receiving repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy: a randomized case-control study.

Study Summary:
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that includes depressive mood. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a therapy method used in the treatment of MDD. The purpose of this study was to assess neurotrophic factors, and oxidative stress levels in MDD patients and evaluate the changes in these parameters as a result of rTMS therapy. Twenty-five patients with MDD and twenty-six healthy volunteers with the same demographic characteristics were included in the study. Brain-derived neurotrophic factors were measured photometrically with commercial kits. Oxidative stress parameters were measured by the photometric method. Oxidative stress index (OSI) and disulfide (DIS) levels were calculated with mathematical formulas. In this study, total antioxidant status (TAS), total thiol (TT), and native thiol (NT) antioxidant parameters and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels were reduced in pre-rTMS with regard to the healthy control group; TOS, OSI, DIS, and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) levels were increased statistically significantly (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Moreover, owing to TMS treatment; TAS, TT, NT, BDNF, GDNF, and ALLO levels were increased compared to pre-rTMS, while DIS, TOS, OSI, and S100B levels were decreased significantly (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). The rTMS treatment reduces oxidative stress and restores thiol-disulfide balance in MDD patients. Additionally, rTMS modulates neurotrophic factors and neuroactive steroids, suggesting its potential as an antidepressant therapy. The changes in the biomarkers evaluated may help determine a more specific approach to treating MDD with rTMS therapy.
