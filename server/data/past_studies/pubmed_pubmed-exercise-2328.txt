Study Title: Effectiveness of an Exercise and Educational-Based Prehabilitation Program in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (PREOptimize) on Functional Outcomes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The study objective was to determine the effectiveness of a prehabilitation program to decrease postoperative musculoskeletal impairments in patients who have breast cancer and are receiving neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Patients who had breast cancer and were receiving NAT before surgery were invited to participate in this randomized controlled trial. Patients randomized to the intervention group participated in a group-based prehabilitation program consisting of Nordic walking, resistance training, and therapeutic education from month 4 of NAT until before surgery. Patients in the control group received usual care (no prehabilitation). The main outcome was arm function measured with the short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire 1&#xa0;month after surgery. Other measures included pain, range of motion, functional capacity, cancer-related fatigue, handgrip strength, physical activity, and arm circumferences. A total of 64 patients were randomized during the study period, and 61 completed all assessments. A significant difference in the main outcome (a short version of the DASH questionnaire) was found before surgery as patients in the control group experienced worsening in arm function (mean difference&#x2009;=&#xa0;-9.84, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#xa0;-17.7 to -2). In addition, they also showed increased symptom frequency/severity according to the combined scale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) (mean difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;+6.7 points, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.1 to 13.4) compared to the intervention group. Prehabilitation also improved functional capacity (mean difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;67.6&#xa0;m, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;37.4 to 97.7) and physical activity levels and decreased cancer-related fatigue (mean difference&#x2009;=&#xa0;-1.3, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#xa0;-2.4 to -0.29) compared to the control group but had no effect on other secondary outcomes. After surgery, patients receiving prehabilitation also exhibited greater functional capacity at both 1 and 3&#xa0;months. No other difference was observed. A prehabilitation program was able to maintain arm function and increase functional capacity while decreasing fatigue in patients with breast cancer receiving NAT. Prehabilitation programs should be offered to patients with breast cancer to maintain functionality and enhance physical performance before surgery. An exercise program combined with therapeutic education in patients with breast cancer who receive NAT before surgery can improve functional capacity and prevent declines of arm mobility and function.
