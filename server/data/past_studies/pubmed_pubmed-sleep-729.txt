Study Title: Therapeutic effects of compression therapy on taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy incidence, negative emotions, and sleep disorders in patients with breast cancer.

Study Summary:
To explore the effects of compression therapy on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders in breast cancer patients administered taxanes. Eighty patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy at Tangshan People's Hospital between October 2022 and July 2023 were randomly divided into control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) and intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) groups. The control group received routine care, while intervention group received compression therapy in addition to routine care (30&#xa0;min before the infusion of chemotherapy drugs, patients wore surgical gloves on their hands that were one size smaller than the appropriate size and elastic socks on their feet until 30&#xa0;min after the infusion). The incidence of CIPN, anxiety, depression, and sleep scores, were compared between these groups before and after compression therapy during chemotherapy cycles 2, 4, and 6. The general characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The CIPN incidence, anxiety and depression scores, and sleep scores also did not differ significantly between the two groups before and after the intervention period (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). After the fourth and sixth cycles of intervention, the incidence of CIPN (&#x2265;&#x2009;1 and&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2), anxiety and depression scores, and sleep scores were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Compression therapy can effectively reduce the incidence of CIPN, as well as improve the level of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders in chemotherapy patients. Therefore, medical personnel should closely observe the physical and psychological changes in patients undergoing chemotherapy and provide corresponding preventive measures. RMYY-LLKS-2022-054.
