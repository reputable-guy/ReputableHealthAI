Study Title: Effects of resistance exercises on inhibitory control and plasma epinephrine levels: A registered report of a crossover randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
According to the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) theory, activity of the LC, the major releaser of NE in the brain, regulates inhibitory control. As there is reciprocal communication between circulating epinephrine and the LC, plasma epinephrine is used as the index of LC-NE activity. The aim of this crossover randomized controlled trial is to expand on previous findings by investigating the effects of free-weight, multiple-joint, and structural barbell resistance exercises. Previous studies have had some methodological limitations, such as failure to report the process of randomization, absence of resistance exercise familiarization before the maximal strength testing, and lack of protocol publication. To address these issues, this study incorporates resistance exercise familiarization, transparent reporting of randomization, and submission as a registered report. The results suggest that a single session of resistance exercise (barbell squat, press, and deadlift) with an intensity of 65%-78% 1RM for five repetitions (70%-90% relative intensity) and three sets with 3-min rest intervals improved Stroop congruent reaction time (RT) only (t(27)&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.663, mean reduction&#x2009;=&#x2009;-15 ms, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.013, 95% CI [-26, -3]). No significant enhancements were observed in Stroop incongruent RT, inhibitory control as indexed by Stroop effect, or inhibitory control as indexed by the RT difference between the Stroop task and the simple reaction task. Moreover, the alterations in plasma epinephrine levels did not significantly associate with changes in any measure of cognitive performance.
