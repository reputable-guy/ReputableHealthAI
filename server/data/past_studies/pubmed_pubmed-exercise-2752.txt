Study Title: Effect of a pragmatic lifestyle modification intervention on physical activity levels and body mass index among obese and overweight adolescents in Udupi, India: a cluster randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Determine the effects of a multifactorial lifestyle intervention on physical activity (PA), BMI and health-related quality of life (QoL) in obese and overweight adolescents. Nine schools in India were clustered randomly in a 12-month study with students allocated to a multifactorial intervention (MFI), or exercise only (EX) or control (CON) group. Participants were adolescents aged 11-16 years (n=671). In the MFI group, adolescents and their parents received lifestyle education using a validated booklet combined with a PA intervention for school students. The EX group received school-based PA only; the CON group continued regular activities. Primary outcomes were PA levels measured with the PAQ-A, and BMI; the secondary outcome was health-related QoL. A linear regression statistical model was used to analyse time, group effects and interactions, with Bonferroni correction for within-group differences at baseline (T0) and at 12-weeks (T1) (post-intervention), 6-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. Significant time and group effects observed for all groups with PA scores (p<0.001), with MFI group having largest increase in PA; with BMI (p<0.001) and MFI showing the least gain in BMI; and HRQOL (p<0.001), with MFI group showing greatest improvement in scores. There were significant increases in PA at T1 and T3 time-points with the EX group, and at T3 time-point only for MFI and CON, with MFI group showing largest increase in HRQOL scores. BMI increased significantly for all groups at T2 (MFI p=0.001, EX p<0.001) and T3 (p<0.001), while HRQOL increased significantly for both MFI and EX at both follow-ups (p<0.001). School-based lifestyle MFI was more effective for improving PA, lifestyle behaviours and HRQOL than exercise alone for adolescents, although BMI was not reduced. MFI with PA could be an effective school-based approach for behaviour modification but BMI has limitations for measuring body composition changes. CTRI/2019/04/018834 (30/04/2019).
