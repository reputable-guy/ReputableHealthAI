Study Title: Effect of meditation or escitalopram on work performance in patients with anxiety disorders.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to 1) examine how psychopharmacotherapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) influence absenteeism and job performance among individuals with anxiety disorders and 2) compare the effectiveness of these treatments in improving work performance. Adults (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;67) with a primary anxiety disorder were recruited to participate in the study. Participants were randomized to escitalopram, a common treatment for anxiety disorders, or MBSR. Absenteeism and job performance were measured with the Health and Work Performance (HPQ) questionnaire prior to treatment and at the week 24 follow up. At week 24, individuals in the escitalopram arm and the MBSR arm showed significant improvements in partial days of missed work due to mental/physical health problems from baseline (1.00 [0.00-2.50] to 0.00 [0.00&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.00], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.034 and 0.00 [0.00-2.00] to 0.00 [0.00&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.00], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001, respectively). In the MBSR arm only, job performance increased from baseline to week 24 (65.00 [50.00-80.00] to 75.00 [67.50-82.50], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.017). None of the outcome variables significantly varied by group at baseline or week 24. Our study finds evidence that MBSR improves work performance equivalently to SSRI medication among individuals with anxiety disorders. Given the limitations of SSRIs, MBSR should be considered as an alternative to individuals who desire improved anxiety symptoms and work outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03522844.
