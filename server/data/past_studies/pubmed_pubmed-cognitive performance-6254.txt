Study Title: Alfaxalone anaesthesia increases brain derived neurotrophic factor levels and preserves postoperative cognition by activating pregnane-X receptors: an in vitro study and a double blind randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Alfaxalone is a fast acting intravenous anaesthetic with high therapeutic index. It is an analogue of the naturally-occurring neurosteroid allopregnanolone responsible for maintenance of cognition and neuroprotection by activation of brain pregnane X receptors and consequent increased production of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (m-BDNF). Two studies are reported here: an in vitro study investigated whether alfaxalone activates human pregnane X receptors (h-PXR) as effectively as allopregnanolone; and a clinical study that measured postoperative changes in serum m-BDNF and cognition in patients after alfaxalone anaesthesia compared with propofol and sevoflurane. In vitro Activation of h-PXR by allopregnanolone and alfaxalone solutions (206 - 50,000&#x2009;nM) was measured using human embryonic kidney cells expressing h-PXR hybridised and linked to the firefly luciferase gene. Light emission by luciferase stimulated by each ligand binding with h-PXR was measured. Clinical A double blind prospective randomised study of patients undergoing hip arthroplasty anaesthetised with alfaxalone TIVA (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;8) or propofol TIVA (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;3) or propofol plus sevoflurane inhalational anaesthesia (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;4). The doses of anaesthetics were titrated to the same depth of anaesthesia (BIS 40-60). Subjects' cognitive performance was assessed using the Grooved Pegboard Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Mini Mental State examination (MMSE) for 7&#x2009;days postoperatively. Serum m-BDNF concentrations were measured for 7 postoperative days. In vitro Allopregnanolone and alfaxalone both activated h-PXR, alfaxalone being more efficacious than allopregnanolone: 50,000&#x2009;nM, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0019; 16,700&#x2009;nM, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0472; 5600&#x2009;nM, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0031. Clinical Alfaxalone treated subjects scored better than propofol and sevoflurane anaesthetised patients in the cognition tests: (MMSE p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0251; Grooved Pegboard test dominant hand pre v post anaesthesia scores p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.8438 for alfaxalone and p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0156 for propofol and propofol/sevoflurane combined). The higher cognition scores were accompanied by higher serum m-BDNF levels in the alfaxalone anaesthetised patients (p&#xa0;<&#x2009;0.0001). These results suggest that sedation and anaesthesia induced by the synthetic neuroactive steroid alfaxalone may be accompanied by effects normally caused by physiological actions of allopregnanolone at PXR, namely, increased secretion of m-BDNF and consequent neuroprotection and preservation of cognition. The clinical trial was registered on 17/01/2018 with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: registration number ACTRN12618000064202 [Universal Trial Number U1111-1198-0412].
