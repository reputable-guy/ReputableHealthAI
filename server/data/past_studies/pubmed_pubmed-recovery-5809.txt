Study Title: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy versus laser lithotripsy in the treatment of post-SWL steinstrasse: a randomized comparative study.

Study Summary:
To compare the efficacy of Holmium laser lithotripsy with that of extracorporeal shock lithotripsy (SWL) for post-SWL ureteral steinstrasse. From January 2022 to July 2023, 36 patients with post-SWL ureteral steinstrasse were randomly divided into laser lithotripsy and SWL groups. Patients with pain, moderate to marked hydronephrosis, large leading stone fragments, and showing no spontaneous resolution within 3-4&#xa0;weeks after medical expulsive therapy were included. Patients with sepsis were excluded. The success rate was the primary outcome. We compared the perioperative data between the groups. The success rate was higher in the ureteroscopy group than in the SWL group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034). SWL was a significantly longer operation, and the fluoroscopy time was significantly longer in the SWL group than in the URS group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027). Auxiliary procedures were more frequently performed in the SWL group than in the URS group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). JJ stents were inserted in 100% of patients in the URS group. Three patients (16.7%) underwent conversion to laser ureteroscopy after the second SWL session failed. No significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications was observed between the groups, but the incidence of postoperative LUT was high in the ureteroscopy group. The mean hospital stay was 30&#xa0;h in the ureteroscopy group. SWL was performed without the need for hospital admission. Ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy for steinstrasse was safe and effective, with a higher success rate, shorter fluoroscopy time, and shorter recovery period than SWL.
