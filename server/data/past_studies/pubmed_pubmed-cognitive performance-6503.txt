Study Title: Cognitive performance as a predictor of healthcare transition in sickle cell disease.

Study Summary:
Neurocognitive deficits in sickle cell disease (SCD) may impair adult care engagement. We investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functioning and socio-environmental factors with healthcare transition outcomes. Adolescents aged 15-18&#xa0;years who had neurocognitive testing and completed a visit with an adult provider were included. Transition outcomes included transfer&#xa0;interval from paediatric to adult care and retention in adult care at 12 and 24&#xa0;months. Eighty adolescents (59% male, 64% HbSS/HbS&#x3b2;-thalassaemia) were included. Mean age at adult care transfer was 18&#xb7;0 (&#xb1;0&#xb7;3)&#xa0;years and transfer interval was 2&#xb7;0 (&#xb1;2&#xb7;3)&#xa0;months. Higher IQ (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;02; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;05) and higher verbal comprehension (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;008; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;024) were associated with <2 and <6&#xa0;month transfer intervals respectively. Better performance on measures of attention was associated with higher adult care retention at 12 and 24&#xa0;months (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;009; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;05 and P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;04; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;12 respectively). Transfer intervals <6&#xa0;months were associated with smaller households (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;02; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;06) and households with fewer children (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;02; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;06). Having a working parent was associated with less retention in adult care at 12 and 24&#xa0;months (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;01; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xb7;02 respectively). Lower IQ, verbal comprehension, attention difficulties and environmental factors may negatively impact transition outcomes. Neurocognitive function should be considered in transition planning for youth with SCD.
