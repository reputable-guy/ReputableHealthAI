Study Title: Randomized Trial to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Daily Intake of an Allulose Amino Acid-Based Hydration Beverage in Men and Women.

Study Summary:
Maintaining adequate hydration is critical to optimal health, well-being, and performance. Those who are physically active in stressful environments, such as warm and/or humid scenarios, may be at particular risk for dehydration with ensuing loss of electrolytes, leading to sluggishness and impaired physical performance. We evaluated an electrolyte and amino acid product containing L-alanine and L-glutamine, as well as select vitamins [B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B12 (cobalamin), and vitamin C (ascorbic acid)]. Subjects (= 40; four groups,= 10) were randomized to consume either a placebo packet or one, two, or three packets daily of the test product for 4 weeks with site visits at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. We tested safety and tolerability by analyzing hematological parameters (complete blood counts), metabolic parameters (hepatic, renal, acid-base balance), urinalysis end products, thyroid status [T3 (triiodothyronine), T4 (thyroxine), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone)], tolerability (via questionnaire), vital signs, and dietary intake. Statistical analyses displayed ten significant main effects (< 0.05) with white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, urinary pH, thyroxine, urination frequency, calcium, calories, fat, and cholesterol. Interactions for time and group (< 0.05) were observed for MCV, eGFR, potassium, overall tolerability, bloating, and cramping-demonstrating mild GA disturbances. Little to no change of physiological relevance was noted for any outcome variable, regardless of dosing level. Our results indicate the product was well-tolerated at all dosing levels and no significant adverse changes occurred in any of the test parameters compared to the placebo group, indicating relative safety of ingestion over a 4-week treatment period, at the volumes used, and outside the context of physical stress.
