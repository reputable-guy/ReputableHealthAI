Study Title: Platelet-Rich Plasma Injections Do Not Improve the Recovery After Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Arthroscopic meniscectomy is one of the most performed surgical procedures in orthopaedics. Different approaches have been proposed to improve patient recovery but with unsatisfactory results. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) augmentation has been proposed as a strategy to improve the recovery after meniscectomy. To investigate the clinical benefits of an intra-articular PRP injection after meniscectomy, in terms of faster and better patient recovery. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Ninety patients were randomized into a treatment group, with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy immediately followed by a 5-mL injection of autologous conditioned plasma, and a control group with partial meniscectomy alone. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 15, 30, 60, and 180 days of follow-up with the visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain (primary outcome), as well as with International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales, Tegner score, and EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale score. Objective evaluation was performed analyzing knee range of motion and circumference and the International Knee Documentation Committee objective score. Complications, patient judgment, and satisfaction were documented as well. No major complications and an overall significant improvement in the clinical scores were observed in both groups. Overall, the comparative analysis did not demonstrate significant between-group differences in absolute values or improvements of both subjective and objective scores, as well as activity level. The improvement in terms of VAS pain score for the treatment group was significant already at 15 days (from 4.3 &#xb1; 2.5 to 2.5 &#xb1; 2.5;= .014), while in the control group it became significant at 30 days (from 3.7 &#xb1; 2.3 to 2.0 &#xb1; 2.4;= .004). No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of judgment of treatment results and satisfaction. A single postoperative injection of PRP was not able to significantly improve patient recovery after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. PRP augmentation did not provide overall benefits at a short-term follow-up (6 months) in terms of pain relief, function, objective parameters, and return-to-sport activities.
