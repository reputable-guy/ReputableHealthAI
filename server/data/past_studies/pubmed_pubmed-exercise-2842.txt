Study Title: Effects of an exercise intervention in primary care after robot-assisted radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
After radical cystectomy physical activity is important to reduce risk of complications, but patients with urinary bladder cancer have difficulties in achieving general recommendations on physical activity and exercise. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was therefore to evaluate the effects of a physical exercise programme in primary care, following discharge from hospital after robot-assisted radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer. Patients with urinary bladder cancer scheduled for robot-assisted radical cystectomy at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden between September 2019 and October 2022 were invited to join the study. At discharge, they were randomised to intervention or active control group. The intervention group was planned to start exercise with physiotherapist in primary care during the third week; the programme included aerobic and strengthening exercises, twice a week for 12 weeks, and daily walks. The control group received unsupervised home-based exercise with daily walks and a sit-to-stand exercise. Assessments were conducted before surgery, at discharge and after four months regarding the primary outcome physical function (Six-minute walk test), and secondary outcomes physical activity, pain, health-related quality of life, fatigue, and psychological wellbeing. Ninety patients were included, mean (sd) age 71.5 (8.5) years. An intention-to-treat analysis showed no intervention effect on the primary outcome physical function, or on pain or psychological wellbeing, but effect on physical activity with a difference from discharge to four months with a median (IQR) of 4790 (3000) and 2670 (4340) daily steps in the intervention and control group, respectively (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046), and for fatigue, and health-related quality of life, in favour of the intervention group. Both the intervention and control groups improved physical function, but the patients who exercised in primary care experienced additional positive effects on physical activity, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. Hence, exercise in primary care after discharge from hospital could be a promising method after radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer. The study was registered in Clinical Trials with registration number NCT03998579, 20,190,607.
