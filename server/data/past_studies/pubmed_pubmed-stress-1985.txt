Study Title: Aerobic exercise training combined with local strength exercise restores muscle blood flow and maximal aerobic capacity in long-term Hodgkin lymphoma survivors.

Study Summary:
It is unclear whether muscle blood flow (MBF) is altered in long-term Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors. We tested the hypothesis that) MBF response during mental stress (MS) is impaired in long-term HL survivors and) aerobic exercise training combined with local strength exercise (ET) restores MBF responses during MS in these survivors. Eighteen 5-year HL survivors and 10 aged-paired healthy subjects (HC) were studied. Twenty HL survivors were randomly divided into two groups: exercise-trained (HLT,= 10) and untrained (HLUT,= 10). Maximal aerobic capacity was evaluated by a cardiopulmonary exercise test and forearm blood flow (FBF) by venous occlusion plethysmography. MS was elicited by Stroop color and word test. ET was conducted for 4 mo, 3/wk for 60 min each session. The aerobic exercise intensity corresponded to anaerobic threshold up to 10% below the respiratory compensation point. The strength exercises consisted of two to three sets of chest press, pulley and squat exercises, 12-15 repetitions each exercise at 30-50% of the maximal voluntary contraction. Baseline was similar in HL survivors and HC, except peak oxygen consumption (peak V&#x307;o,= 0.013) and FBF (= 0.006) that were lower in the HL survivors. FBF responses during MS were lower in HL survivors (< 0.001). ET increased peak V&#x307;o(11.59&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.07%,= 0.002) and FBF at rest (33.74&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.13%,< 0.001) and during MS (24&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.31%,= 0.001). Further analysis showed correlation between the changes in peak V&#x307;oand the changes in FBF during MS (r = 0.711,= 0.001). In conclusion, long-term HL survivors have impaired MBF responses during MS. ET restores MBF responses during MS.Long-term Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors have impaired muscle blood flow responses during mental stress and decreased maximal aerobic capacity. Supervised aerobic exercise training combined with local strength exercises restores muscle blood flow responses during mental stress and maximal aerobic capacity in these survivors. These findings provide evidence of safety and effectiveness of exercise training in HL survivors. Moreover, they highlight the importance of exercise training in the treatment of this set of patients.
