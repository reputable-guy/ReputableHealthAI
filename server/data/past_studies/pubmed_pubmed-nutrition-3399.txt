Study Title: Perioperative and post-hospital whole-course nutrition management in patients with pancreatoduodenectomy - a single-center prospective randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Whole-course nutrition management (WNM) has been proven to improve outcomes and reduce complications. We conducted this randomized controlled trial to validate its effectiveness in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). From 1 December 2020, to 30 November 2023, this single-center randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Hepatobiliopancreatic Surgery in a major hospital in Beijing, China. Participants who were undergoing PD were enrolled and randomly allocated to either the WNM group or the control group. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative complications. Subgroup analysis in patients who were at nutritional risk was performed. Finally, a 6-month follow-up was conducted and the economic benefit was evaluated using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A total of 84 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) into the WNM group and the control group. The incidences of total complications (47.6% vs. 69.0%, P =0.046), total infections (14.3% vs. 33.3%, P =0.040), and abdominal infection (11.9% vs. 31.0%, P =0.033) were significantly lower in the WNM group. In the subgroup analysis of patients at nutritional risk, 66 cases were included (35 cases in the WNM group and 31 cases in the control group). The rate of abdominal infection (11.4% vs. 32.3%, P =0.039) and postoperative length of stay (23.1&#xb1;10.3 vs. 30.4&#xb1;17.2, P =0.046) were statistically different between the two subgroups. In the 6-month follow-up, more patients reached the energy target in the WNM group (97.0% vs. 79.4%, P =0.049) and got a higher daily energy intake (1761.3&#xb1;339.5 vs. 1599.6&#xb1;321.5, P =0.045). The ICER suggested that WNM saved 31 511 Chinese Yuan (CNY) while reducing the rate of total infections by 1% in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and saved 117 490 CNY in patients at nutritional risk, while WNM saved 31 511 CNY while reducing the rate of abdominal infections by 1% in the ITT population and saved 101 359 CNY in patients at nutritional risk. In this trial, whole-course nutrition management was associated with fewer total postoperative complications, total and abdominal infections, and was cost-effective, especially in patients at nutritional risk. It seems to be a favorable strategy for patients undergoing PD.
