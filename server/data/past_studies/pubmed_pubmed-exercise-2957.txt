Study Title: Effectiveness of craniosacral therapy, Bowen therapy, static touch and standard exercise program on sleep quality in fibromyalgia syndrome: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbance is commonly seen in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS); however, high quality studies involving manual therapies that target FMS-linked poor sleep quality are lacking for the Indian population. Craniosacral therapy (CST), Bowen therapy and exercises have been found to influence the autonomic nervous system, which plays a crucial role in sleep physiology. Given the paucity of evidence concerning these effects in individuals with FMS, our study tests the effectiveness of CST, Bowen therapy and a standard exercise program against static touch (the manual placebo group) on sleep quality in FMS. A placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted on 132 FMS participants with poor sleep at a hospital in Bangalore. The participants were randomly allocated to one of the four study groups, including CST, Bowen therapy, standard exercise program, and a manual placebo control group that received static touch. CST, Bowen therapy and static touch treatments were administered in once-weekly 45-minute sessions for 12&#xa0;weeks; the standard exercise group received weekly supervised exercises for 6&#xa0;weeks with home exercises until 12 weeks. After 12&#xa0;weeks, all study participants performed the standard exercises at home for another 12&#xa0;weeks. Sleep quality, pressure pain threshold (PPT), quality of life and fibromyalgia impact, physical function, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and positive-negative affect were recorded at baseline, and at weeks 12 and 24 of the intervention. At the end of 12&#xa0;weeks, the sleep quality improved significantly in the CST group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.037) and Bowen therapy group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.023), and the PPT improved significantly in the Bowen therapy group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002) and the standard exercise group (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), compared to the static touch group. These improvements were maintained at 24&#xa0;weeks. No between-group differences were observed for other secondary outcomes. CST and Bowen therapy improved sleep quality, and Bowen therapy and standard exercises improved pain threshold in the short term. These improvements were retained within the groups in the long term by adding exercises. CST and Bowen therapy are treatment options to improve sleep and reduce pain in FMS.
