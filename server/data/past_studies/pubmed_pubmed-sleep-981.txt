Study Title: Exploring Behavioral Risk Factors for Non-communicable Diseases Among Undergraduate Medical Students in Western Gujarat: A Cross-Sectional Study.

Study Summary:
Background The burden of morbidity and death caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is a significant global health concern influenced by modifiable behavioral risk factors. In India, the burden of NCDs is particularly high, with medical college students being a vulnerable population. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by investigating the prevalence and patterns of behavioral risk factors for NCDs among medical college students. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted on medical students in Gujarat. Risk factors for NCDs were assessed using various tools, including the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) for stress, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) for physical activity, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, the body mass index (BMI) for obesity, and dietary factors. The chi-square test was employed as a statistical tool to determine the association between socio-demographic variables and various risk factors. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Among the 400 students surveyed, the prevalence of single behavioral NCD risk factors was as follows: 248 (62%) reported stress (GHQ-12), 215 (54%) experienced poor sleep quality (PSQI), 251 (63%) had low levels of physical activity (IPAQ), 339 (85%) had inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, 97 (24%) consumed extra salt during meals, 163 (41%) were overweight or obese, and 189 (47%) had three or more risk factors for NCDs. In bivariate logistic regression analysis, factors such as age, male gender, urban residence, hostel stay, and lower socioeconomic status were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion This study reveals an alarming failure of medical colleges to positively influence students' health behaviors, despite their medical knowledge. The high rates of inactivity, stress, poor diet, and obesity among students demonstrate the curriculum's inability to instill preventative lifestyle practices. This omission in training compromises students' own health and their ability to counsel patients on NCD prevention. Urgent reform is needed to integrate health promotion into the curriculum, providing a supportive campus culture focused on wellness. By overlooking students' behaviors, medical colleges gravely disserve these future providers. This evidence compels curriculum reform to develop exemplary physician role models for NCD prevention.
