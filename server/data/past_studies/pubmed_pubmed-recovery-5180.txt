Study Title: Efficacy of radial incision combined with tunnel floating line drainage in the treatment of high posterior horseshoe anal fistula and perianal flora: Randomized control trial.

Study Summary:
Due to the high prevalence of posterior horseshoe anal fistula and causing numerous complications, this study aimed to investigate the clinical effect of radial incision combined with tunnel floating line drainage (RCTD) and arc incision internal drainage in the treatment of the disease and the influence on perianal flora. Ninety-six subjects treated with high posterior horseshoe anal fistula were stochastically assigned to a joint group (RCTD), and control group (arc incision internal drainage). The operation-related conditions, complication rate, anal function, and recurrence rate of 6 months after operation were compared, and perianal secretions were collected before operation and 1 day after operation to detect the changes of microbial flora. After operation, it was corroborated notable difference between joint group and control group in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, wound healing time, visual analogue scale score 6 hours after operation and phase I cure rate. Chi square test analysis showed notable difference between control group (27.08%) and joint group (10.40%) in incidence of complications, in terms of number of pathogens detected around anus, significantly smaller of the incremental change for the joint subgroup versus the control subgroup 1 day after operation. RCTD can be the best choice for patients with high posterior horseshoe anal fistula. This operation method has the advantages of short operation time, less trauma, fewer complications, fast recovery of anal function, and can also reduce perianal pathogenic bacteria infection.
