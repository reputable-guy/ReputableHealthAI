Study Title: A randomized, multicenter, crossover psychometric evaluation study of an iPad-administered cognitive test battery in participants with major depressive disorder who responded to treatment with oral antidepressants.

Study Summary:
Performance validity and test-retest reliability of ReVeRe.D, an iPad-administered cognitive test battery in major depressive disorder (MDD) were analyzed. Participants aged 18-59 years had DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD with adequate visual and hearing acuity. All had responded to oral antidepressant treatment for a major depressive episode within the most recent 24-months and were stable with no greater than mild depressive symptoms as evidenced by Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score <17. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 test sequences (AABB or BBAA; A=ReVeRe.D; B=examiner-administered tests) in a crossover design. 244 randomized participants (AABB: n=123; BBAA: n=121) had mean age of 38.3 years; 54.9% had a college, baccalaureate, or higher education. At first administration, Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) for 6/10 pairs of corresponding ReVeRe.D vs examiner-administered tests exceeded the pre-specified acceptance criterion (PCC=0.53) for the primary analysis; 8 test score pairs had PCC exceeding 0.40. At second administration, PCC for 9/10 test scores pairs exceeded PCC=0.53. Together, the series of PCCs supports the concurrent validity for ReVeRe.D. Test-retest reliability for ReVeRe.D test scores was generally moderate to high. The study included stable participants with MDD who had responded to oral antidepressant treatment, with most in at least partial remission. The sample was limited to English-speaking participants, and skewed towards white, college-educated women. Further studies in acutely ill MDD patients who represent a broader demographic, are warranted. iPad-administered ReVeRe.D is a valid and reliable computerized test battery for assessment of cognitive performance in MDD.
