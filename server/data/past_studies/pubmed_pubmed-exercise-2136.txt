Study Title: McConnell patelar taping improves unipodal squat postural control in women with patellofemoral pain syndrome: A randomised trial.

Study Summary:
McConnell's patellar taping is indicated for the treatment of women with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome, however the literature points to controversial evidence, and does not establish the effect on postural control. This is a randomized trial study that aimed to compare the effect of McConnell taping (MT) with a Placebo taping (PT), during functional tasks that assess dynamic postural control, such as squatting and ascending/descending stairs, using a force platform among women with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). The participants were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: MT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15) and PT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15). The primary outcome was dynamic postural control in the unipodal squatting test and the test of ascending and descending steps evaluated using a force platform, before and after the application of the intervention. The results showed that in the single leg squat exercise, the MT group performed better compared to the PT group in the center of pressure oscillation area (A-COP), and anteroposterior and mediolateral velocity. For ascending stairs, the PT group performed better in the A-COP compared to the MT group. The stair descent showed no differences between the groups or moments of assessment. So, MT can be used to improve postural control in single-legged squat exercises.
