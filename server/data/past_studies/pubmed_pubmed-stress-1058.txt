Study Title: The effect of life skills training on reducing domestic violence and improving treatment adherence in women with diabetes experiencing intimate partner violence: a randomized clinical trial based on the theory of self-efficacy.

Study Summary:
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global health problem and the cause of chronic diseases, such as diabetes. It has a negative effect on adherence to treatment, decreases self-efficacy beliefs, and intensifies stress in women. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of life skills training based on the self-efficacy theory on IPV and adherence to treatment in women with type 2 diabetes. This trial was conducted using a pretest-posttest design and follow-up after one month. The samples included 100 women selected by convenience sampling with random block allocation with type 2 diabetes and IPV. The intervention consisted of 8 sessions over one month of life skills training based on self-efficacy theory. Participants completed questionnaires at pre-test, post-test and follow-up, including a demographic information form and questionnaires on IPV and treatment adherence. Considered statistically significant at P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0. 05. The mean changes in IPV scores from the pre-test to the post-test were -&#x2009;8.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.06 and -&#x2009;0.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.09 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Also, the reduction in the intervention group was significantly more than in the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; 95%CI=-9.75; -6.89). The mean changes in IPV scores from post-test to follow-up were -&#x2009;1.36&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.47 and 1.50&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.14 in intervention and control groups, respectively, indicating a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; 95%CI=-4.38; -1.34). The mean changes in adherence scores from the pre-test to the post-test were 11.40&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.23 and 0.68&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.49 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The increase was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; 95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.18; 12.26). The mean changes in adherence scores from post-test to follow-up were 2.68&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.06 and -&#x2009;0.86&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.43 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; 95%CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.95; 5.12). Life skills training based on self-efficacy theory reduced IPV and improved treatment compliance in women with diabetes under IPV. It is recommended that this training be taught to other patients with chronic conditions as a means of violence prevention and treatment adherence.
