Study Title: Lifestyle Intervention Modulates the CD4+ T Cell Profile in the Blood of Crohn's Disease Patients.

Study Summary:
Crohn's disease (CD) significantly affects patients' well-being and is influenced by stress and lifestyle factors, highlighting the importance of improving quality of life in CD management. An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell responses is a key factor in CD, and stress has been shown to alter the function of CD4+ T cells. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of a mind-body medicine stress management and lifestyle modification (MBM) program on the CD4+ T cell profile in CD patients. Circulating CD4+ T cells from CD patients were analyzed by flow cytometry following the MBM program. Patients were randomly assigned to either a guided intervention group (IG) or a self-guided waitlist control group (CG) over a 9-month trial and compared with healthy blood donors. Lifestyle intervention reduced regulatory T cell (Treg) frequencies in the blood of CD patients. Notably, we observed a significant correlation between the quality of life improvement and Treg frequencies in the IG but not in the CG. Furthermore, differential activation and expression of the gut-homing molecules G protein-coupled receptor 15 and CCR9 on circulating Tregs and CD4+ effector T cells were detected in both the IG and CG. The MBM program, whether guided or self-directed, has the potential to restore the CD4+ T cell profile of CD patients to levels comparable to healthy blood donors. Lifestyle interventions may benefit CD progression, symptoms, and immunological status, but further analysis is needed to substantiate these findings and to fully understand their clinical implications.
