Study Title: Effectiveness of an interactive online group intervention based on pain neuroscience education and graded exposure to movement in breast cancer survivors with chronic pain: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness, compared with usual care, of an interactive online group programme combining pain neuroscience education (PNE) and graded exposure to movement (GEM) for improving quality of life and pain experience in breast cancer survivors with chronic pain. This single-blind randomised controlled trial included a sample of 49 breast cancer survivors who were randomly assigned to two groups (experimental: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22 and control: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27). The experimental group received a 12-week person-centred online programme based on pain neuroscience education and therapeutic yoga as gradual exposure to movement, while the control group continued with their usual care. The primary outcome was quality of life (FACT-B&#x2009;+&#x2009;4); the secondary outcomes were related to the experience of chronic pain (pain intensity, pain interference, catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, kinesiophobia, and fear avoidance behaviours). All variables were assessed at four time points (T0, baseline; T1, after PNE sessions; T2, after yoga sessions; T3, at 3-month follow-up). For data analysis, ANOVA (2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;4) analysis of variance (95% CI) was used when outcomes were normally distributed. If not, within-group and between-group comparisons were calculated. Thirty-six participants were included in the analysis (control group, 22; experimental group, 14). A significant time&#xa0;*&#xa0;group effect was observed in favour of the experimental group regarding the global quality of life score (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010, &#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.124). Significant differences in favour of the experimental group were observed for pain intensity, pain interference, catastrophizing, and pain self-efficacy. These differences persisted at follow-up. An online intervention based on PNE and GEM appears to be more effective than usual care for improving quality of life in breast cancer survivors with chronic pain, as a time per group interaction was reported. In addition, the intervention also significantly improved the participants' experience of chronic pain. However, due to the study limitations further research is needed. Trial record: NCT04965909 (26/06/2021).
