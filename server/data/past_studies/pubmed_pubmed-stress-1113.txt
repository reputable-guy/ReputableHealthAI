Study Title: A 12-week WeChat education, relaxing, and care program relieves anxiety, depression, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder in parents of childhood lymphoma patients.

Study Summary:
In our previous study, we conducted a 6-month WeChat education and care program for parents of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, which was effectively alleviated anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This study implemented a 12-week WeChat education, relaxing, and care program (WERC) to investigate its effect on psychological disorders and insomnia in parents of childhood lymphoma patients. Totally, 112 parents of 56 childhood lymphoma patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into WERC (&#x2009;=&#x2009;56) or normal care (NC) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;56) groups to receive corresponding 12-week interventions. The self-rating anxiety/depression scale (SAS/SDS), Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and impact of events scale-revised (IES-R) scores were assessed at enrollment (W0) and 12&#x2005;weeks after the initiation of the intervention (W12); score changes (W0-W12) were also calculated. Scores of the scales at W0 did not differ between groups (all&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The WERC group showed a lower SAS score at W12 (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045) and greater change in SAS score (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) than the NC group. The SDS score at W12 was not different (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.119), while SDS score change was numerically greater (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.076) in the WERC group than the NC group. Compared with the NC group, the WERC group tended toward a decreased AIS score at W12 (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.054) and a greater AIS score change (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The IES-R score at W12 was lower (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.040), and the IES-R score change was greater (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) in the WERC group than the NC group. A 12-week WERC ameliorates psychological disorders and insomnia better than NC in parents of childhood lymphoma patients.
