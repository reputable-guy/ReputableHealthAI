Study Title: Dietary changes and cognition over 2&#xa0;years within a multidomain intervention trial-The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER).

Study Summary:
Association between healthy diet and better cognition is well established, but evidence is limited to evaluate the effect of dietary changes adopted in older age. We investigated the role of dietary changes in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) with 1260 at-risk participants (60-77&#xa0;years) who were randomized to intensive multidomain intervention (including dietary counseling) or regular health advice for 2&#xa0;years. Parallel process latent growth curves of adherence to dietary recommendations and cognitive performance were analyzed. Adherence to healthy diet at baseline predicted improvement in global cognition, regardless of intervention allocation (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.003). Dietary improvement was associated with beneficial changes in executive function, especially in the intervention group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.008; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.051 for groups combined). Dietary changes initiated during the intervention were related to changes in executive function in 2&#xa0;years. Long-term diet appeared more influential for global cognition.
