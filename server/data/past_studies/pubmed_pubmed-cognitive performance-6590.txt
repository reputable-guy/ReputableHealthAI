Effects of multi-ingredient preworkout supplements on physical performance, cognitive performance, mood state, and hormone concentrations in recreationally active men and women. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2493-2501, 2022-Performance enhancement supplement research has primarily focused on the effectiveness of individual ingredients, rather than the combination. This study investigated the acute effects of 2 multi-ingredient preworkout supplements (MIPS), with beta-alanine and caffeine (BAC) and without (NBAC), compared with placebo (PLA) on anaerobic performance, endurance capacity, mood state, cognitive function, vascular function, and anabolic hormones. Thirty exercise-trained individuals (24.4 &#xb1; 4.9 years, 15 men and 15 women) completed a fatiguing exercise protocol on 3 separate occasions, 30 minutes after ingestion of BAC, NBAC, or PLA. Outcomes were analyzed using one-way or two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, as appropriate (alpha = 0.05). Anaerobic power was greater when supplementing with NBAC (10.7 &#xb1; 1.2 W&#xb7;kg -1 ) and BAC (10.8 &#xb1; 1.4 W&#xb7;kg -1 ) compared with PLA (10.4 &#xb1; 1.2 W&#xb7;kg -1 ) ( p = 0.014 and p = 0.022, respectively). BAC improved V&#x307; o2 peak time to exhaustion ( p = 0.006), accompanied by an increase in blood lactate accumulation ( p < 0.001), compared with PLA. Both NBAC and BAC demonstrated improved brachial artery diameter after workout ( p = 0.041 and p = 0.005, respectively), but PLA did not. L-arginine concentrations increased from baseline to postsupplement consumption of BAC ( p = 0.017). Reaction time significantly decreased after exercise for all supplements. There was no effect of supplement on mood states. Exercise-trained individuals looking to achieve modest improvements in power and endurance may benefit from consuming MIPS before exercise.
