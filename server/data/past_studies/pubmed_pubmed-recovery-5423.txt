Study Title: Investigating the impact of patient-centered peer counseling on anxiety and pain among burn patients: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Pain and anxiety are common complications in burn patients, significantly impacting treatment effectiveness and overall patient well-being. Peer counseling, a form of patient education provided by individuals with shared experiences, may hold potential to alleviate this pain and anxiety. This study seeks to investigate the effectiveness of patient-centered education through peer counseling on background pain and state anxiety levels in these patients. A two-arm, parallel, randomized, controlled trial design was employed. A total of 86 participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups: control and intervention groups. State anxiety and background pain levels were assessed using the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), respectively, before and after intervention. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, independent t-test, and paired t-test, were employed to analyze the data. The intervention significantly reduced pain and anxiety in the intervention group compared to baseline (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001). There was no significant difference between the control and intervention groups in baseline levels, but there was a significant difference after the intervention (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001). This study demonstrates the efficacy of patient-centered education through peer counseling in reducing background pain and state anxiety levels in burn patients. Compared to standard education, peer counseling led to a more pronounced reduction in both pain and anxiety, suggesting its potential as a valuable nonpharmaceutical intervention to improve patient well-being during burn recovery. Based on our findings, we recommend that healthcare providers consider implementing peer-based education programs in burn care settings.
