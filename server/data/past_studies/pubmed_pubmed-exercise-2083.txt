Study Title: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Coupled With Visual-Feedback Cycling Exercise Improves Walking Ability and Walking Stability After Stroke: A Randomized Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Stroke survivors exhibit persistent abnormal gait patterns, particularly in diminished walking ability and stability, limiting mobility and increasing the risk of falling. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) coupled with cycling exercise on walking ability and stability in patients with stroke and explore the potential mechanisms underlying motor cortex recovery.In this double-blinded randomized pilot trial, 32 stroke patients were randomly separated into the real-rTMS group (RG, receiving rTMS during active cycling exercise) and the sham-rTMS group (SG, receiving sham rTMS during active cycling exercise). Participants completed 10 exercise sessions (5 times per week). Lower extremity function was measured using the Fugl-Meyer assessment of lower extremity (FMA-LE), and functional balance ability was measured by the Berg balance scale (BBS). The 2-min walk test (2MWT) and standing balance test were employed to evaluate walking and balance ability. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured to evaluate cortical excitability. The above assessments were administered at baseline and after the intervention. Additionally, the cycling exercise performance was recorded after the initial and final exercise sessions to evaluate the motor control during exercise.The RG showed significant improvements in lower extremity function (FMA-LE) and functional balance ability (BBS) compared to the SG at postintervention. The walking and balance abilities, as well as the motor asymmetry of cycling exercise, significantly improved in RG. Additionally, participants in RG exhibited a higher elicitation rate of ipsilesional MEPs than that in SG. The improvements in motor asymmetry of cycling exercise in RG were significantly associated with increases in FMA-LE scores and walking ability.The combination of rTMS and cycling exercise effectively improves walking ability and walking stability in patients with stroke, which may be related to the excitability modulation of the motor cortex induced by rTMS.: Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR2400079360.
