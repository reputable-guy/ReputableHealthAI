Study Title: User perceptions and utilisation of features of an AI-enabled workplace digital mental wellness platform 'mindline at work.

Study Summary:
The working population encounters unique work-related stressors. Despite these challenges, accessibility to mental healthcare remains limited. Digital technology-enabled mental wellness tools can offer much-needed access to mental healthcare. However, existing literature has given limited attention to their relevance and user engagement, particularly for the working population. This study aims to assess user perceptions and feature utilisation of, a nationally developed AI-enabled digital platform designed to improve mental wellness in the working population. This study adopted a mixed-methods design comprising a survey (n=399) and semistructured interviews (n=40) with office-based working adults. Participants were asked to usefor 4&#x2009;weeks. We collected data about utilisation of the platform features, intention for sustained use and perceptions of specific features. Participants under 5 years of work experience reported lower utilisation of multimedia resources but higher utilisation of emotion self-assessment tools and the AI chatbot compared with their counterparts (p<0.001). The platform received a moderate level of satisfaction (57%) and positive intention for sustained use (58%). Participants regardedas an 'essential' safeguard against workplace stress, valuing its secure and non-judgmental space and user anonymity. However, they wanted greater institutional support for office workers' mental wellness to enhance the uptake. The AI chatbot was perceived as useful for self-reflection and problem-solving, despite limited maturity. Identifying the unique benefits of specific features for different segments of working adults can foster a personalised user experience and promote mental well-being. Increasing workplace awareness is essential for platform adoption.
