Study Title: The impact of melatonin on postoperative delirium in geriatric patients after colorectal surgery: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The current study was designed to evaluate the role of prophylactic melatonin administration in reducing delirium occurrence in elderly patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgeries. One hundred patients of both genders undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgeries under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into two equal groups. A treatment group of patients (Melatonin group) received five mg of melatonin the night before surgery, twelve hours before the scheduled surgery time, and an additional five mg of melatonin two hours before surgery. The control group of patients received placebo tablets at the same time points. Delirium score, sedation score, pain score, hemodynamics, oxygen saturation, and blood requirements were recorded. Twenty-eight patients (56%) in the control group versus 18 (36%) in the melatonin group developed delirium (P=0.045), OR=2.26, 95% CI: 1.013-5.05. Five patients (18%) in the control group versus six (33%) &#x200e;in the melatonin group developed delirium on discharge from the &#x200e;recovery room (P=0.749), OR=1.22, 95% CI: 0.34-4.31, while 23 patients (82%) in the control group versus &#x200e;&#x200e;12 (66%) in the melatonin group developed delirium six hours postoperative (P=0.021), OR=1.705, 95% CI: 1.02-2.81 &#x200e;with higher nursing delirium screening score in the control group 2 (1, 4) versus 1 (0, 2) in the melatonin group (P=0.002), 95% CI: 1.77-2.71. The prophylactic administration of melatonin may decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgeries under general anesthesia.
