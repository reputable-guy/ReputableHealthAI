Study Title: Impact of elevated core temperature on cognition in hot environments within a military context.

Study Summary:
Cognition can be impaired during exercise in the heat, potentially contributing to military casualties. To our knowledge, the independent role of elevated core temperature during exercise has not been determined. The aim of the current study was to evaluate effects of elevated core temperature on cognition during physically encumbering, heated exercise, and to determine whether the perceptual cooling effects of menthol preserves cognition. Eight participants complete three trials in randomised order: one normothermic (CON) and two with elevated (38.5&#xb0;C) core temperature, induced by prior immersion in neutral versus hot water The CON trial and one hot trial (HOT) used a water mouth-rinse following each cognitive task of the trial, (HOT) while the other used a menthol mouth-rinse (MENT). Participants walked in humid heat (33&#xb0;C, 75% relative humidity) in military clothing, completing a cognitive battery of reaction time, perceptual processing, working memory, executive function, cognitive flexibility, vigilance, and declarative memory. No differences in cognitive performance were observed between any conditions. Near-infrared spectroscopy showed greater oxygenated haemoglobin tissue content in HOT and MENT compared to CON (&#x394;OHb-deOHb: 2.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.5&#xa0;&#xb5;M, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.024), and lower deoxygenated haemoglobin in MENT than in CON or HOT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.017), suggesting higher brain metabolism during the more stressful conditions. Moderately elevated core (38.5&#xb0;C) and skin temperature does not appear to impair cognitive performance during exercise despite mildly elevated cerebral metabolism. The effects of menthol remain undetermined due to the lack of heat-mediated cognitive impairment.
