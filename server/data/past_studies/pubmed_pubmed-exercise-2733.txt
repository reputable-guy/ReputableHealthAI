Study Title: Role of Comprehensive Vestibular Rehabilitation Based on Virtual Reality Technology in Residual Symptoms After Canalith Repositioning Procedure.

Study Summary:
&#xa0;We aimed to explore the role of comprehensive vestibular rehabilitation based on virtual reality (VR) technology in residual symptoms after canalith repositioning procedure. &#xa0;A total of 124 patients, who were diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from September 2020 to July 2023 and had residual symptoms 24 hours after the canalith repositioning procedure, were selected as the subjects. They were randomly divided into a normal control (NC) group, a Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise group (n=41), a Brandt-Daroff exercise group (n=41), and a VR group (n=42). The NC group received no intervention, the Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise group underwent Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise, the Brandt-Daroff exercise group was subjected to Brandt-Daroff exercise, and the VR group was given comprehensive vestibular rehabilitation based on VR technology. &#xa0;After treatment, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and vestibular symptom index (VSI) scores of the virtual reality (VR), Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise, and Brandt-Daroff exercise groups were significantly lower than those of the NC group (P <.05). The scores of the VR group were lower than those of the Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise and Brandt-Daroff exercise groups (P < .05). The abnormality rates of ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP) and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) in VR, Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise, and Brandt-Daroff exercise groups were lower than those of the NC group (P <05). The rates of the VR group were lower than those of the Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise and Brandt-Daroff exercise groups (P <05). &#xa0;Comprehensive vestibular rehabilitation based on VR technology can cure the residual symptoms after the canalith repositioning procedure, reduce the abnormality rates of oVEMP and cVEMP, and reconstruct the balance ability.
