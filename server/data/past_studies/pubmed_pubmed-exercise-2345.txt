Study Title: Using the Nintendo&#x2122; Wii to Improve Physical Function and Reduce the Risk of Falls in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: Numerous exercise programs that improve physical capacity and the risk of falls in older adults have been proposed with varying degrees of success. A novel approach may be to use a video game system that uses real-time force feedback to train older adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a Nintendo&#x2122; Wii-based exercise program on physical function and risk of falls in older people. (2) Methods: This 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial involved 73 participants: 36 individuals participating in a control group (CG) and 37 in an experimental group (EG) participating in a combined program. Balance was measured using the Tinetti scale, flexibility was assessed with the back scratch test and the sit-and-reach test, and lower body strength was assessed with the 30 s chair stand-up test. (3) Results: The results of this study show significant improvements in balance, gait, flexibility, and strength of the lower limbs compared to a control group. (4) Conclusions: A Nintendo&#x2122; Wii-based exercise program for seniors produces improvements in the physical health of older adults. These improvements highlight the importance of integrating physical exercise through video games as an effective strategy to improve the general health and quality of life of older adults.
