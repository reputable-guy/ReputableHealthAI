Study Title: Next Generation, Modifiable Cardiometabolic Biomarkers: Mitochondrial Adaptation and Metabolic Resilience: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.

Study Summary:
Cardiometabolic risk is increasing in prevalence across the life span with disproportionate ramifications for youth at socioeconomic disadvantage. Established risk factors and associated disease progression are harder to reverse as they become entrenched over time; if current trends are unchecked, the consequences for individual and societal wellness will become untenable. Interrelated root causes of ectopic adiposity and insulin resistance are understood but identified late in the trajectory of systemic metabolic dysregulation when traditional cardiometabolic risk factors cross current diagnostic thresholds of disease. Thus, children at cardiometabolic risk are often exposed to suboptimal metabolism over years before they present with clinical symptoms, at which point life-long reliance on pharmacotherapy may only mitigate but not reverse the risk. Leading-edge indicators are needed to detect the earliest departure from healthy metabolism, so that targeted, primordial, and primary prevention of cardiometabolic risk is possible. Better understanding of biomarkers that reflect the earliest transitions to dysmetabolism, beginning in utero, ideally biomarkers that are also mechanistic/causal and modifiable, is critically needed. This scientific statement explores emerging biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk across rapidly evolving and interrelated "omic" fields of research (the epigenome, microbiome, metabolome, lipidome, and inflammasome). Connections in each domain to mitochondrial function are identified that may mediate the favorable responses of each of the omic biomarkers featured to a heart-healthy lifestyle, notably to nutritional interventions. Fuller implementation of evidence-based nutrition must address environmental and socioeconomic disparities that can either facilitate or impede response to therapy.
