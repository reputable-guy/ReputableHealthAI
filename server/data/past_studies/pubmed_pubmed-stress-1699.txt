Study Title: Evaluating Yoga-Based Intervention Versus the American Diabetes Association Exercise Regimen in Conjunction With Standard Care for Autonomic Neuropathy in Diabetes Mellitus: An Exploratory Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a prevalent yet often overlooked complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), impacting multiple organs and substantially elevating the risk of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of yoga-based intervention (YBI) compared to the American Diabetes Association exercise regimen (ADA Ex. Regime) and standard care for treating autonomic neuropathy in type 2 DM. This open-label exploratory clinical trial featured two parallel study arms: Group A (Intervention), which received YBI alongside standard care, and Group B, which adhered to the ADA Ex. Regime in conjunction with standard care. A total of 80 participants aged 35-60, diagnosed with type 2 DM and autonomic neuropathy, were equally allocated to both groups. Data collection included nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests, autonomic function tests (AFTs), as well as evaluations of depression and quality of life. YBI demonstrated a drop in parasympathetic tone compared to the ADA Ex. Regime. Following a six-month intervention, the sympathetic activity indicator (SD2) exhibited a significantly lower value in the YBI group than in the ADA Ex. Regime group, indicating a positive effect (p < 0.05), while the ADA Ex. Regime&#xa0;showed more improvement in certain areas of NCV (e.g., left and right peroneal NCV, right and left peroneal F-latency), notable differences were observed in alkaline phosphatase levels, depression scores, and WHO-5 wellness, all reaching statistical significance at p < 0.05. The study findings observed that a 24-week YBI significantly reduced in symptoms of diabetic neuropathy and stress. Although the ADA Ex. Regime&#xa0;demonstrated greater improvement in specific aspects of NCV compared to YBI, YBI outperformed the ADA Ex. Regime in enhancing WHO-5 wellness and reducing depression symptoms.
