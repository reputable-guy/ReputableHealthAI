Study Title: Aerobic high-intensity interval training and maximal strength training in patients with unspecific musculoskeletal disorders improve V&#x307;Oand maximal strength more than moderate training.

Study Summary:
Improving peak oxygen uptake (V&#x307;O) and maximal strength are key objectives of rehabilitation for patients with unspecific musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Although high-intensity training yield superior outcomes for these factors, patients with MSDs may not tolerate high-intensity due to pain and fear. Therefore, we examined the effect and feasibility of incorporating aerobic high-intensity intervals (HIITs) and maximal strength training (MST) in a standard clinical rehabilitation program for patients with unspecific MSDs. 73 patients (45&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10&#xa0;years) with MSDs partaking in a standard, public, and 4-week rehabilitation program were randomized to high-intensity training (HG: 4&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;4 minutes intervals at &#x223c;90% of maximal heart rate; HR, and 4&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;4 repetitions leg press at &#x223c;90% of 1 repetition maximum; 1RM, with maximal intended velocity) or keep todays treatment of low-to moderate-intensity training (MG: various cycling, walking, and/or running activities at &#x223c;70%-80% of HRand 3&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;8&#xa0;-&#xa0;10 repetitions leg press at &#x223c;75% of 1RM without maximal intended velocity). HG improved V&#x307;O(12&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7%) and leg press 1RM (43&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;34%) more than moderate-intensity group (V&#x307;O; 5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6%, 1RM; 19&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;18%, both p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). We observed that no adverse events and no between-group differences in dropout rate or self-reported quality of life (both p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). There were positive correlations between improved V&#x307;Oand improved physical (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024) and emotional (0.016) role functioning. We conclude that both high-intensity interval training and MST are feasible and improve V&#x307;Oand maximal strength more than standard low-to moderate-intensity treatment of patients with unspecific MSDs. Our findings suggest that high-intensity training should be implemented as a part of standard clinical care of this patient population.
