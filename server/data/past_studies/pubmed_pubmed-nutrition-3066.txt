Study Title: Caffeine optimizes Zumba training benefits on functional performances in middle-aged women: a randomized trial study.

Study Summary:
The current study aimed to explore the effect of daily caffeine supplementation (100&#xa0;mg/day) and 12-week of Zumba training on functional performances in middle-aged women. Eighty-five middle-aged women were randomized into 4 groups including control, Zumba training (ZT), caffeine supplementation (Ca) or caffeine-Zumba training (Ca&#x2009;+&#x2009;ZT) groups. Functional performances were assessed using 10&#xa0;m Walk, Timed Up and Go, Functional Reach, and 30-Second Chair Stand tests. As results, ZT, Ca and Ca&#x2009;+&#x2009;ZT intervention programs showed a significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) functional performances improvement. However, Ca&#x2009;+&#x2009;ZT group showed significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) better scores in terms of mobility (95%CI [0.71, 1.43]), gait speed (95%CI [0.52, 1.71]) and lower body endurance strength (95%CI [-6.93, -1.92]), except for dynamic balance (95%CI [-9.41, -3.44]). In conclusion, 12-week of Zumba training improves functional performances in middle-aged women, and daily caffeine intake is an effective alternative for improving such performances. Supplementing caffeine (100&#xa0;mg/day) to Zumba training was effective in boosting Zumba benefits on these functional performances.
