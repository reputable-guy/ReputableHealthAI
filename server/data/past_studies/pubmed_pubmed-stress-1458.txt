Study Title: Effects of the Laying on of Hands on Stress, Depression, Fatigue, and Quality of Life in Oncology Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Complementary medicine through the laying on of hands (LOH) is commonly integrated with conventional medicine in cancer patients to improve symptoms. However, studies evaluating the effects of the LOH with Spiritual connection (LHSP) on oncology patients are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LHSP, and LOH without Spiritual connection (LHW) compared to a control group on the outcomes of oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. It is a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. The study took place at the Center for Integrative and Complementary Practices of the Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro, MG, Brazil. Participants were aged &#x2265;18 years with a diagnosis of cancer undergoing parenteral chemotherapy. Those who were unable to understand the questionnaires or were absent during the three therapy sessions were excluded. Using block randomization, eligible patients were allocated to one of the following groups: LHSP, receiving LOH by Spiritist "passe"; LHW, receiving LOH with healing intent; and a control group exposed to sham without LOH. Each intervention lasted 5 minutes. Patients were evaluated by a blinded researcher at baseline, at eight, and ten weeks. The outcomes, including stress, anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, quality of life, vital signs, and adverse effects, were compared among groups. A total of 90 patients with cancer were randomized. After 10 weeks, the LHSP differed significantly from the control for depression (Cohen's d = 1.24), nausea/vomiting (Cohen's d = 0.71), and loss of appetite symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.71); and also to the LHW and control for adverse events (P = 0.023). There were significant differences in depression (Cohen's d = 1.37) and loss of appetite symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.71) between LHW and control. Furthermore, the LHSP and LHW differed significantly from the control for depression (Cohen d = 0.83 and Cohen d = 1.19, respectively) and for stress (Cohen d = 0.62 and Cohen d = 0.74, respectively) in patients with solid tumors. The present results suggest that&#xa0;LOH treatments can improve the mental and physical symptoms, thus maintaining the quality of life in oncology patients during chemotherapy. However, LHSP was more effective in controlling physical symptoms and safer than LHW and control groups. Further studies exploring biological markers, treatment response, and longer follow-up periods are required across different cancer types.
