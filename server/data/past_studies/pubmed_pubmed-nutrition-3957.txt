Study Title: Metabolic and ruck performance effects of a novel, light-weight, energy-dense ketogenic bar.

Study Summary:
What is the central question of the study? Can a novel, energy-dense and lightweight ketogenic bar (1000&#xa0;kcal) consumed 3&#xa0;h before exercise modulate steady-state incline rucksack march ('ruck') performance compared to isocaloric carbohydrate bars in recreationally active, college-aged men? What is the main finding and its importance? Acute ingestion of either nutritional bar sustained &#x223c;1&#xa0;h of exhaustive rucking with a 30% of body weight rucksack. This proof-of-concept study is the first to demonstrate that carbohydrate bars and lipid bars are equally feasible for preserving ruck performance. Novel ketogenic nutrition bars may have military-relevant applications to lessen carry load without compromising exercise capacity. Rucksack marches ('rucks') are strenuous, military-relevant exercises that may benefit from pre-event fuelling. The purpose of this investigation was to explore whether acute ingestion of carbohydrate- or lipid-based nutritional bars before rucking can elicit unique advantages that augment exercise performance. Recreationally active and healthy males (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;29) were randomized and counterbalanced to consume 1000&#xa0;kcal derived from a novel, energy-dense (percentage energy from carbohydrate/fat/protein: 5/83/12) ketogenic bar (KB), or isocaloric high-carbohydrate bars (CB; 61/23/16) 3&#xa0;h before a time-to-exhaustion (TTE) ruck. Conditions were separated by a 1-week washout. The rucksack weight was standardized to 30% of bodyweight. Steady-state treadmill pace was set at 3.2&#xa0;km/h (0.89&#xa0;m/s) and 14% grade. TTE was the primary outcome; respiratory exchange ratio (RER), capillary ketones (R-&#x3b2;-hydroxybutyrate), glucose and lactate, plus subjective thirst/hunger were the secondary outcomes. Mean TTE was similar between conditions (KB: 55&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;25&#xa0;vs. CB: 54&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;22&#xa0;min; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.687). The RER and substrate oxidation rates revealed greater fat and carbohydrate oxidation after the KB and CB, respectively (all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001). Capillary R-&#x3b2;HB increased modestly after the KB ingestion (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001). Neither bar influenced glycaemia. Lactate increased during the ruck independent of the condition (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001). Thirst/fullness perceptions changed independent of the nutritional bar consumed. A novel KB nutritional bar produced equivalent TTE ruck results to the isocaloric CBs. The KB's energy density relative to CB (6.6&#xa0;vs. 3.8&#xa0;kcal/g) may provide a lightweight (-42% weight), pre-event fuelling alternative that does not compromise ruck physical performance.
