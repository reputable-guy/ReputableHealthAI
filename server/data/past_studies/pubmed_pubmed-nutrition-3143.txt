Study Title: In-person versus remote (mHealth) delivery for a responsive parenting intervention in rural Kenya: a cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
An estimated 43% of children under age 5 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience compromised development due to poverty, poor nutrition, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Numerous early childhood development (ECD) parenting interventions have been shown to be effective at improving ECD outcomes, at least in the short-term, but they are (a) still too expensive to implement at scale in low-resource and rural settings, and (b) their early impacts tend to fade over time. New approaches to deliver effective ECD parenting interventions that are low-cost, scalable, and sustainable are sorely needed. Our study will experimentally test a traditional in-person group-based delivery model for an evidence-based ECD parenting intervention against a hybrid-delivery model that increasingly substitutes in-person meetings with remote (mHealth) delivery via smartphones, featuring audiovisual content and WhatsApp social interactions and learning. We will assess the relative effectiveness and cost of this hybrid-delivery model compared to in-person delivery and will extend the interventions over two years to increase their ability to sustain changes in parenting behaviors and ECD outcomes longer-term. Our evaluation design is a cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (cRCT) across 90 villages and approximately 1200 households. Midline and endline surveys collected 12 and 24 months after the start of the interventions, respectively, will examine short- and sustained two-year intention-to-treat impacts on primary outcomes. We will also examine the mediating pathways using mediation analysis. We hypothesize that a hybrid-delivery ECD intervention will be lower in cost, but remote interactions among participants may be an inferior substitute for in-person visits, leaving open the question of the most cost-effective program. Our goal is to determine the best model to maximize the intervention's reach and sustained impacts to improve child outcomes. By integrating delivery into the ongoing operations of local Community Health Promoters (CHPs) within Kenya's rural health care system, and utilizing new low-cost technology, our project has the potential to make important contributions towards discovering potentially scalable, sustainable solutions for resource-limited settings.
