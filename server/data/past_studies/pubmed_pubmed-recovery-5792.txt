Study Title: Hip biomechanics in early recovery following fixation of intertrochanteric fractures: Results from a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Single and dual integrated screw femoral nails are both commonly used to treat intertrochanteric fractures. This study investigated if using single or dual integrated screw femoral nails result in different post-operative hip joint loading. In the presence of differences, we investigated potential contributing factors. Patients were randomised for treatment via single screw (Stryker, Gamma3) or dual-integrated screw nail (Smith and Nephew, Intertan). Pre-injury mobility levels were collected at enrolment. Hip radiographs and gait data were collected at six weeks (Gamma: 16; Intertan: 15) and six months (Gamma: 14; Intertan: 13) follow-up. The resultant hip joint reaction forces and abductor muscle forces were estimated using electromyography-assisted neuromusculoskeletal modelling during level walking gait. Our primary analysis focused on the resultant hip joint reaction force and abductor muscle forces. We compared between groups, across stance phase of walking gait, using statistical parametric mapping. At six weeks, the Intertan group showed a short (&#x223c;5% of stance phase) but substantial (33&#xa0;% [0.3&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;body weight] greater magnitude) resultant hip joint reaction force when compared to the Gamma group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022). Higher gluteus medius forces (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009) were demonstrated in the Intertan group at six weeks. Harris Hip Scores followed the trend seen for the biomechanical outcomes with superior scores for the Intertan group at six weeks postoperative (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.044). The use of dual-integrated screw femoral nails over single screw devices may allow for hip biomechanics more closely resembling normal hip function at earlier post-operative timepoints, but these appear to resolve by six months postoperative.
