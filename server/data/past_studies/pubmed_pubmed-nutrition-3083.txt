Study Title: Bridging the Gap in Policy Implementation through a Health Equity Lens: Insights from a 2-Year Study on Measurement Development.

Study Summary:
Policy implementation measurement lacks an equity focus, which limits understanding of how policies addressing health inequities, such as Universal School Meals (USM) can elicit intended outcomes. We report findings from an equity-focused measurement development study, which had two aims: (1) identify key constructs related to the equitable implementation of school health policies and (2) establish face and content validity of measures assessing key implementation determinants, processes, and outcomes.: To address Aim 1, study participants (i.e., school health policy experts) completed a survey to rate the importance of constructs identified from implementation science and health equity by the research team. To accomplish Aim 2, the research team developed survey instruments to assess the key constructs identified from Aim 1 and conducted cognitive testing of these survey instruments among multiple user groups. The research team iteratively analyzed the data; feedback was categorized into "easy" or "moderate/difficult" to facilitate decision-making.: The Aim 1 survey had 122 responses from school health policy experts, including school staff (= 76), researchers (= 22), trainees (= 3), leaders of non-profit organizations (= 6), and others (= 15). For Aim 2, cognitive testing feedback from 23 participants was predominantly classified as "easy" revisions (69%) versus "moderate/difficult" revisions (31%). Primary feedback themes comprised (1) comprehension and wording, (2) perceived lack of control over implementation, and (3) unclear descriptions of equity in questions.: Through adaptation and careful dissemination, these tools can be shared with implementation researchers and practitioners so they may equitably assess policy implementation in their respective settings.
