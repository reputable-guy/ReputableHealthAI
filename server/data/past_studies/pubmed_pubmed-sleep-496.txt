Study Title: Physiological Effects and Tolerance of Wearing Surgical and N95 Masks during Sleep in Normal Individuals and Patients with Mild-Moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Randomized Crossover Trial.

Study Summary:
In certain situations, masks are worn during sleep to prevent respiratory infections. However, the effects of mask wearing on cardiopulmonary function during sleep are unknown. This study aimed to determine whether wearing masks during sleep has an impact on cardiopulmonary function, including in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. This was a prospective, randomized crossover-controlled trial. The effects of wearing surgical masks or N95 respirators on cardiopulmonary function were measured in healthy subjects and patients with mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep breathing parameters were monitored during nocturnal sleep using a sleep monitor, and subjective feelings about mask wearing were assessed using a questionnaire. Wearing masks during sleep at night did not significantly impact sleep breathing parameters. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in heart rate, blood oxygenation, and blood pressure before and after wearing masks. However, wearing masks, especially the N95 mask, had an adverse impact on sleep quality, and masks were found to be subjectively uncomfortable. Wearing masks during sleep at night does not adversely affect cardiopulmonary function but they can be uncomfortable, especially the N95 mask. Thus, in circumstances where wearing N95 masks during nocturnal sleep proves intolerable, we recommend the use of surgical masks as a more comfortable alternative.
