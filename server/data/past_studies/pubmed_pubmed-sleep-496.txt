Study Title: The Efficacy and Safety of Minocycline-Containing Quadruple Therapies AgainstInfection: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Study Summary:
Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, has anti-() properties and can be used to treatinfection. However, only a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the efficacy of minocycline-containing quadruple therapy (MCQT) in treatinginfection. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of MCQT and investigate the factors influencing both aspects. This was a retrospective cohort study. Patients diagnosed withinfection between January 1, 2022, and July 31, 2023 at. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of, and the secondary outcome was the number and type of adverse events. A total of 828 patients were included in this study. The overalleradication rate among the included patients at 95% confidence interval (CI) (Range 0.864 to 0.907) was 88.53%. Theeradication rate for patients who received MCQT regimen as the primary therapy was 92.28% (95% CI: 0.901-0.945), significantly higher than that of patients who received MCQT as rescue therapy (80.81%; 95% CI: 0.761-0.855,0.003). Adverse events, including dizziness, abdominal distension, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, constipation, headache, rash, sleep disorder, palpitation, backache, and anorexia, occurred in 185 (22.34%) patients, with dizziness being the most common (75/828, 9.06%). Compliance with MCQT therapy was an independent factor influencingeradication in patients receiving MCQT as a primary therapy. Compliance and presence or absence ofinfection symptoms at the time of screening were independent factors influencingeradication in patients receiving MCQT as rescue therapy. Factors that influenced the occurrence of adverse events included reasons forinfection screening, residence, treatment compliance, and the use of acid-suppressant regimens. MCQT regimens were effective ininfection eradication, and the treatment resulted only in fewer adverse events when used as primary or rescue therapies forinfection treatment. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive data are needed to validate our findings.
