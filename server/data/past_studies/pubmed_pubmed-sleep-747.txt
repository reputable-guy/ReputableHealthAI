Study Title: Assessing the Real-World, Long-Term Impact of Lemborexant on Sleep Quality in a Home-Based Clinical Study.

Study Summary:
Both subjective and objective evaluations are essential for the treatment of insomnia. Lemborexant has been shown to be effective in the long-term based solely on a subjective basis, and no long-term objective measures have been evaluated under natural sleep conditions. Small, lightweight sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor was used, instead of polysomnography, to objectively evaluate sleep at home 4 and 12 weeks after lemborexant treatment. Adults and elderly subjects with insomnia disorder, per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, were enrolled in this open-label, single-arm, single-center trial. Objective and subjective measures of sleep were prospectively assessed. Sleep disturbance, excessive sleepiness, and depressive symptoms were assessed using questionnaires. A total of 45 subjects were screened, of which 33 were enrolled. Paired t-tests were conducted to evaluate changes in sleep variables and compared with the baseline; subjects showed significant improvements in objective sleep efficiency (SE) and subjective sleep parameters at weeks 4 and 12 following treatment with lemborexant. When baseline values were taken into account, a repeated-multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed statistically significant changes in the objective measures. Sleep disturbance, excessive sleepiness, and depressive symptoms improved after three months of lemborexant treatment. Furthermore, lemborexant therapy improved nocturnal sleep, when measured objectively using sleep EEG monitoring at home, and improved daytime sleepiness and depressive symptoms in older adults with insomnia disorder.
