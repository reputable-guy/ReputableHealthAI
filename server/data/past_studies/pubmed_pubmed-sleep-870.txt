Study Title: Bowel preparation protocol for hospitalized patients ages 50 years or older: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The incidence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer progressively increase with age and become particularly prominent after the age of 50 years. Therefore, the population that is &#x2265; 50 years in age requires long-term and regular colonoscopies. Uncomfortable bowel preparation is the main reason preventing patients from undergoing regular colonoscopies. The standard bowel preparation regimen of 4-L polyethylene glycol (PEG) is effective but poorly tolerated. To investigate an effective and comfortable bowel preparation regimen for hospitalized patients &#x2265; 50 years in age. Patients were randomly assigned to group 1 (2-L PEG + 30-mL lactulose + a low-residue diet) or group 2 (4-L PEG). Adequate bowel preparation was defined as a Boston bowel preparation scale (BBPS) score of &#x2265; 6, with a score of &#x2265; 2 for each segment. Non-inferiority was prespecified with a margin of 10%. Additionally, the degree of comfort was assessed based on the comfort questionnaire. The proportion of patients with a BBPS score of &#x2265; 6 in group 1 was not significantly different from that in group 2, as demonstrated by intention-to-treat (91.2%91.0%,0.953) and per-protocol (91.8%91.0%,0.802) analyses. Furthermore, in patients &#x2265; 75 years in age, the proportion of BBPS scores of &#x2265; 6 in group 1 was not significantly different from that in group 2 (90.9%97.0%,0.716). Group 1 had higher comfort scores (8.85 &#xb1; 1.1627.59 &#xb1; 1.735,0.001), longer sleep duration (6.86 &#xb1; 1.204 h5.80 &#xb1; 1.730 h,0.001), and fewer awakenings (1.42 &#xb1; 1.1832.04 &#xb1; 1.835,0.026) than group 2. For hospitalized patients &#x2265; 50 years in age, the bowel preparation regimen comprising 2-L PEG + 30-mL lactulose + a low-residue diet produced a cleanse that was as effective as the 4-L PEG regimen and even provided better comfort.
