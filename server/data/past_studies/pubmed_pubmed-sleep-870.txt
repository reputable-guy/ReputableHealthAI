Study Title: Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFL&#xd9; in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): A pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of Sedifl&#xf9;, a medical device containing active herbal ingredients, on nocturnal and diurnal persistent coughs in children, with a duration of 3 to 7 days. Children with a dry and/or productive cough were enrolled in this prospective, interventional, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study. Clinical efficacy was assessed through the evaluation of the soothing action of Sedifl&#xf9; against dry and/or productive coughing, both at night and during the day, and other effects of coughing associated with quality of sleep: frequency, child's quality of sleep, parental quality of sleep and severity. Treatment with Sedifl&#xf9; improved both night-time and day-time cough scores from day 2. The diurnal score also improved significantly in the Sedifl&#xf9; group at days 3 and 7. Sedifl&#xf9; syrup can be considered a valid treatment for cough management in younger children with upper respiratory tract infections, shortening the cough duration.
