Study Title: From Vineyard to Vision: Efficacy of Maltodextrinated Grape Pomace Extract (MaGPE) Nutraceutical Formulation in Patients with Diabetic Retinopathy.

Study Summary:
Despite recent advances, pharmacological treatments of diabetic retinopathy (DR) do not directly address the underlying oxidative stress. This study evaluates the efficacy of a nutraceutical formulation based on maltodextrinated grape pomace extract (MaGPE), an oxidative stress inhibitor, in managing DR. A 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 99 patients with mild to moderate non-proliferative DR was conducted. The MaGPE group showed improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) values at T3 (< 0.001) and T6 (< 0.01), a reduction in CRT (at T3 and T6, both< 0.0001) and a stabilization of vascular perfusion percentage, with slight increases at T3 and T6 (+3.0% and +2.7% at T3 and T6, respectively, compared to baseline). Additionally, the levels of reactive oxygen metabolite derivatives (dROMs) decreased from 1100.6 &#xb1; 430.1 UCARR at T0 to 974.8 &#xb1; 390.2 UCARR at T3 and further to 930.6 &#xb1; 310.3 UCARR at T6 (< 0.05 vs. T0). Similarly, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) levels decreased from 953.9 &#xb1; 212.4 &#xb5;Eq/L at T0 to 867.0 &#xb1; 209.5 &#xb5;Eq/L at T3 and markedly to 735.0 &#xb1; 213.7 &#xb5;Eq/L at T6 (< 0.0001 vs. T0). These findings suggest that MaGPE supplementation effectively reduces retinal swelling and oxidative stress, contributing to improved visual outcomes in DR patients.
