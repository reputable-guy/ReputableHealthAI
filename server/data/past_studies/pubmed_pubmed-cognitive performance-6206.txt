Study Title: Effectiveness of vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder and early-stage dementia: The MEMORY study.

Study Summary:
Depression and dementia are highly prevalent in older adults and often co-occur. This Phase IV study investigated the effectiveness and tolerability of vortioxetine in improving depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, daily and global functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and comorbid early-stage dementia. Patients (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;82) aged 55-85&#xa0;years with a primary diagnosis of MDD (onset before age 55&#xa0;years) and comorbid early-stage dementia (diagnosed &#x2265;6&#xa0;months before screening and after onset of MDD; Mini-Mental State Examination-2 total score, 20-24) received vortioxetine for 12&#xa0;weeks (initiated at 5&#xa0;mg/day and up-titrated to 10&#xa0;mg/day at day 8, with flexible dosing thereafter [5-20&#xa0;mg/day]). The primary endpoint was change from baseline in Montgomery-&#xc5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at week 12. Significant improvement in depressive symptom severity was seen from week 1 onwards (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001). At week 12, the least-square mean (standard error) change in MADRS total score from baseline was -12.4 (0.78). Significant improvements in cognitive performance were observed (from week 1 for the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and week 4 for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test). Patients also experienced significant improvements in daily and global functioning, and HRQoL. Vortioxetine was well tolerated. From week 4 onwards, more than 50&#xa0;% of patients were receiving 20&#xa0;mg/day. Open-label study. Vortioxetine demonstrated effectiveness in clinically significantly improving depressive symptoms, cognitive performance, daily and global functioning, and HRQoL in patients with MDD and comorbid early-stage dementia treated for 12&#xa0;weeks.
