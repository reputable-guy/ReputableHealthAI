Study Title: Mobile Application Increased Nutrition Knowledge Among Brazilian Physicians.

Study Summary:
To assess whether using a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet recommendation application increases primary care physicians' knowledge and dietary counseling skills. A randomized controlled trial. Brazilian public primary care service. Two hundred and twenty-two physicians (intervention group: n&#xa0;=&#xa0;111; control group: n&#xa0;=&#xa0;111). Thirty days of using the Dieta Dash application. The application provides information about nutritional recommendations for hypertension management. Nutrition knowledge score. self-assessment of knowledge, self-confidence, assessment of eating habits, and barriers to dietary counseling. Linear mixed-effects models for repeated measures and generalized estimating equations for comparing changes between groups. A total of 66.2% of participants completed the follow-up. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the mean knowledge score (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.15). The prevalence of high knowledge increased by 12% (prevalence ratio [PR]&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.25) in the intervention group and showed an improvement in the self-confidence assessment (PR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.44), and increased assessment of eating habits (PR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.55). The Dieta Dash application helped address dietary counseling, improving knowledge and self-confidence. However, innovative strategies are needed to minimize the primary care barriers.
