Study Title: The impact of cannabidiol placebo on amygdala-based neural responses to an acute stressor.

Study Summary:
Cannabidiol (CBD) impacts brain regions implicated in anxiety reactivity and stress reactivity (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI)); however, placebo-controlled studies are mixed regarding CBD's anxiolytic effects. We previously reported that CBD expectancy alone can alter subjective, physiological, and endocrine markers of stress/anxiety; however, it is unclear whether these findings reflect altered brain reactivity. This study evaluated whether CBD expectancy independently alters amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the ACC and AI following acute stress. Thirty-eight (20 females) healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive accurate or inaccurate information regarding the CBD content of a CBD-free oil administered during a single experimental session. Following a baseline resting state MRI scan, participants administered their assigned oil sublingually, engaged in a stress task (serial subtraction with negative feedback) inside the scanner, and underwent another resting state MRI scan. Amygdala rsFC with the ACC and AI was measured during each scan, and the subjective state was assessed at six time points. Outcomes were analyzed using ANCOVA. CBD expectancy (vs CBD-free expectancy) was associated with significantly weaker rsFC between the left amygdala and right ACC (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042), but did not systematically alter amygdala-AI rsFC (values&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). We also replicated our previously reported CBD expectancy effects on subjective stress/anxiety in the scanner context. CBD placebo effects may be sufficient to alter neural responses relevant to its purported anxiolytic and stress-relieving properties. Future work is needed to replicate these results and determine whether CBD expectancy and pharmacology interact to alter neural anxiety reactivity and stress reactivity.
