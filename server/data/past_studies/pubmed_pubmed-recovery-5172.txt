Study Title: The Influence of "Labels" for Neck Pain on Recovery Expectations Following a Motor Vehicle Crash: An Online-Randomized Vignette-Based Experiment.

Study Summary:
To (1) investigate whether different labels for neck pain after a motor vehicle crash (MVC) influenced recovery expectations and management beliefs, (2) explore reasons for low recovery expectations and greater likelihood for lodging a claim, and (3) explore the moderating effect of neck pain history and sociodemographic characteristics.Online randomized experiment with nested qualitative content analysis.We randomized 2229 participants from the general population (mean age: 46.7 &#xb1; 17.5 years; 72.4% females; 66% with previous or current neck pain; 10% with an MVC experience) to read 1 of 5 scenarios describing a patient with neck pain after an MVC, each was labeled as,,,, orThe primary outcome was recovery expectations, rated on a 0- to 10-point scale.Participants allocated toorhad lower recovery expectations than those allocated to(adjusted mean difference [95% confidence interval]: -0.5 [-0.9 to -0.1] for both comparisons).led to more recovery uncertainty, whileled to greater doubt about the health care provider. Most secondary outcomes showed significant but small differences. Participants allocated towere less inclined to claim than those allocated toordue to less perceived need for financial support. Neck pain history moderated labeling effects on recovery expectations; household income moderated the claim intention.Labels for neck pain after an MVC influenced recovery expectations and management preferences. The clinical relevance of the small effects was unclear..
