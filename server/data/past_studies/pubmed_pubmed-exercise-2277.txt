Study Title: Effects of exercise referral schemes enhanced with behavioural self-management strategies on functional capacity and self-reported disability in community-dwelling older adults. Secondary results from the SITLESS multi-country, three-armed randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Exercise referral schemes (ERS) are an effective strategy for increasing physical activity (PA) in older adults. Behavioural self-management strategies (SMS) may augment the maintenance of PA and associated benefits in this population, resulting in preservation of the functional capacity and prevention of disability over the long-term. The primary aim was to investigate the long-term (22-months) effects of ERS enhanced with SMS on functional capacity assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) compared to ERS (primary comparison) and a control condition (CTRL).Secondarily, between-group effects after 4 and 16&#xa0;months on the SPPB and self-reported disability outcomes were investigated. 1360 physically inactive community-dwelling older adults &#x2265;65&#xa0;years from four European countries were randomized into (i) 16&#xa0;weeks ERS enhanced with SMS (ERS-SMS), (ii) ERS alone and (iii) CTRL. In addition to SPPB, self-reported function and disability were assessed by the short-form late life function and disability index and with a six-item activity of daily living questionnaire. No long-term effects were found for the SPPB-score in ERS-SMS vs ERS (0.21 point, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.46]). Significant group &#xd7; time effects were observed for the SPPB-score after 4&#xa0;months in favour of ERS-SMS over CTRL (0.51 point, 95% CI [0.29, 0.73]) and ERS (0.46 point, 95% CI [0.24, 0.68]). The study did demonstrate differences, in favour of ERS&#x2009;+&#x2009;SMS, but on SPPB these were small, and not sustained over time. The additional effect of SMS was inconsistent and uncertain.
