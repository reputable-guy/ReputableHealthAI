Study Title: Comparative effects of cognitive and instability resistance training versus instability resistance training on balance and cognition in elderly women.

Study Summary:
This study investigates the effects of integrated instability resistance training and cognitive training (IRCT) versus isolated instability resistance training (IRT) on balance, gait, muscle strength, and cognitive functions in elderly women.This randomized controlled trial included 36 participants, with 18 in the IRCT group and 18 in the IRT group. The sample size was estimated to achieve a statistical power of 0.95 with a large effect size (0.40; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12 each group). The closed-eye single-leg stand test was measured for static balance, the closed-eye stepping test, and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) were measured for dynamic balance. Dual-task balance was assessed by combining the TUGT with cognitive tasks (TUGT-C) and motor tasks (TUGT-M). Gait performance was evaluated using a gait function system. Lower limb muscle strength was measured with the 30-Second Chair Stand Test. Cognitive function was assessed through the Trail Making Test (TMT), Digit Span Test (DST), Stroop Color and Word Test (Stroop), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Results IRCT group showed better improvements in both cognitive (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and motor (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.812 for baseline; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001 for post-intervention) dual-task abilities, IRCT also experienced better enhancement in certain cognitive functions, particularly in the TMT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and DSST (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.022) compared to the IRT group. Both groups demonstrated enhancements in walking abilities as shown on selective markers of the gait performance test (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and leg muscle strength via 30-Second Chair (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001 for time main effect). These results suggest that combining cognitive exercises with physical training more effectively addresses the complex challenges associated with aging in women. The study highlights the potential of comprehensive training approaches in boosting health and quality of life for the elderly, with implications for developing tailored exercise programs focused on reducing fall risks and enhancing quality of life in this population.
