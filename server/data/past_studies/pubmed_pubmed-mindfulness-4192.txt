Study Title: Mind it! A mindfulness-based group psychotherapy for substance use disorders in adolescent inpatients.

Study Summary:
Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is the most frequent reason for psychiatric inpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment among 15-19-year-olds in Germany. Despite effective treatment programs, relapse rates remain high. Thus, existing multi-component programs (TAU) need to be enhanced with SUD-specific elements. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) seem promising as they can positively influence SUD-related behaviors (e. g. craving). Given limited research in adolescents, this randomized controlled trial investigated the extent to which MBI-based group therapy (Mind it!) as an add-on treatment to TAU led to fewer cannabis use days after 6&#xa0;months in 84 adolescent inpatients with CUD. Additionally, craving, severity of CUD, and changes in mindfulness were monitored (pre-, post-, and follow-up (FU) assessments). The results revealed a significant reduction in cannabis use days in both groups at 6-month FU (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.72 and&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#xa0;0.75). Although minor additional benefits of Mind it! were evident post-treatment, specifically reduction of craving and SUD severity, by the 6-month mark, TAU exhibited a more substantial decrease in SUD severity (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78), and reward craving (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28) compared to Mind it!. Regarding self-regulation skills (mindfulness), Mind it! demonstrated superiority over TAU after 6-month FU (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27). Therapists judged the MBI as feasible. (Serious) adverse events were unrelated to Mind it!. There was a systematic dropout among Mind it! participants. Primarily, the results emphasize the effectiveness of TAU in reducing cannabis use. MBI also seem feasible for youth, but results remain inconsistent and unstable over time. Importantly, enhanced adherence to reduce dropouts is needed.Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00014041. Registered on 17 April 2018.
