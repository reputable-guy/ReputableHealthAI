Study Title: Beyond the pain: A qualitative study exploring the physical therapy experience in patients with chronic low back pain.

Study Summary:
Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a complex condition that is physically and psychologically debilitating, with vulnerable populations experiencing more severe outcomes. Physical therapy (PT) includes evidence-based treatments that can reduce disability, however the experience of PT can vary amongst different populations. Empirical evidence is largely based on majority samples that are predominantly white with high educational attainment. Little is known regarding how people from vulnerable groups (e.g. low income and racial minority) experience physical therapy treatment for low back pain. To describe the experience of physical therapy in a predominantly low-income and minority population with cLBP. This qualitative study was embedded within a randomized controlled trial for patients with cLBP in urban, underserved communities. We used a convenience sample to interview 12 participants from the 102 who participated in the PT arm of the trial and then performed thematic analysis to describe their experience. Three major themes emerged: 1) Empowerment through education and exercise; 2) Interconnectedness to providers and other patients; and 3) Improvements in pain, body mechanics, and mood. Divergent cases were few however centered around a lack of improvement in pain or an absence of connection with the therapist. Within the first theme a prevailing sub-theme emerged that aligned with Bandura's theory of self-efficacy: 1) Mastery of experience; 2) Verbal persuasion; 3) Vicarious experience; and 4) Physiological state. Our participants' insight highlighted the value of cognitive-emotional and interpersonal dimensions of PT. These may be particularly important components of PT in populations that have experienced systemic distrust in providers and disparities in services. Future work could use Bandura's model of self-efficacy to build a PT intervention comprised of fear-based movement exercises, interconnectedness, a strong therapeutic alliance, and mindfulness techniques.
