Study Title: A Prospective Study Evaluating the Effects of a Nutritional Supplement Intervention on Cognition, Mood States, and Mental Performance in Video Gamers.

Study Summary:
Cognitive function is critical for successful prolonged performance in eSports. This double-blind placebo-controlled study examined the effect of an inositol-enhanced arginine silicate oral supplement on cognitive performance and energy in eSports athletes. Sixty healthy men and women who spent 5 or more hours a week playing video games were randomly assigned to take supplement or placebo for 7 days. On day 1 and 7, before and 15 min after dosing, subjects completed the Trail Making Test (TMT), Parts A and B; Stroop Test; and Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire, and then played a video game for 60 min. Immediately after, cognitive tests were repeated. Self-reported energy levels increased, anger decreased, and TMT-B test errors decreased in the supplement group compared to placebo (< 0.05). Fatigue, TMT-B time, and TMT B-A score improved in the supplement group compared to baseline (< 0.05). After 60 min of gaming, supplementation decreased Stroop Test errors and TMT-A time (< 0.05). Adverse events were minimal and not different between groups. These data appear to support the use of the studies product (nooLVL) in eSports gamers looking to improve their accuracy, decision making, and reaction time during gaming.
