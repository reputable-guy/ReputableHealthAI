Study Title: Acute Stress Does Not Affect Motor Imagery Ability in Young, Healthy Participants: A Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
Motor imagery (MI) is the mental representation of a movement without its execution. It activates internal representations of the movement without external stimulus through different memory-related processes. Although acute stress is frequent in the population and affects supraspinal structures essential for memory functionality, it is still unknown how that stress affects MI capacity and temporal congruence (TC) between execution and movement imagination. This study aimed to&#xa0;discover how acute stress may influence MI capacity and TC in the subscales of internal and external visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted. Sixty-two young, healthy subjects (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;20.65 [2.54]; 39 females and 23 males) unfamiliar with the assessment and uses of MI were recruited. Participants were assigned by stratified randomization to the stress group or the control group. Stress was induced by the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST), while the control group performed the MAST control protocol. MI capacity and TC were assessed before (t1) and after (t2) MAST stress or control using the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-3 (MIQ-3). Electrodermal activity and heart rate variability were further recorded as control variables to assess stress induction. Thirty subjects in the stress group and 26 subjects in the control group were analyzed. No significant group differences were observed when comparing MI capacity or TC in any subscales. These findings suggest that acute stress does not significantly affect MI capacity or TC in young, healthy, non-experienced MI subjects. MI could thus be a relevant helpful technique in stressful situations.
