Study Title: Effects of mixed oil emulsion on short-term clinical outcomes in premature infants: A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study compared the clinical effects of two different lipid emulsions in premature infants with gestational age <&#x2009;32 weeks (VPI) or birth weight <&#x2009;1500&#x2009;g (VLBWI) to provide an evidence-based medicine basis for optimizing intravenous lipid emulsion. This was a prospective multicenter randomized controlled study. A total of 465 VPIs or VLBWIs, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of five tertiary hospitals in China from March 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, were recruited. All subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, namely, medium-chain triglycerides/long-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;231) and soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil (SMOF) group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;234). Clinical features, biochemical indexes, nutrition support therapy, and complications were analyzed and compared between the two groups. No significant differences were found in perinatal data, hospitalization, parenteral and enteral nutrition support between the two groups (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Compared with the MCT/LCT group, the incidence of neonates with a peak value of total bilirubin (TB)&#x2009;>&#x2009;5&#x2009;mg/dL (84/231 [36.4% vs. 60/234 [25.6%]), a peak value of direct bilirubin (DB)&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2&#x2009;mg/dL (26/231 [11.3% vs. 14/234 [6.0%]), a peak value of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#x2009;>&#x2009;900&#x2009;IU/L (17/231 [7.4% vs. 7/234 [3.0%]), and a peak value of triglycerides (TG)&#x2009;>&#x2009;3.4&#x2009;mmol/L (13/231 [5.6% vs. 4/234[1.7%]]) were lower in the SMOF group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Univariate analysis showed that in the subgroup analysis of <&#x2009;28 weeks, the incidence of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) and metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP) were lower in the SMOF group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043 and 0.029, respectively), whereas no significant differences were present in the incidence of PNAC and MBDP between the two groups at >&#x2009;28 weeks group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.177 and 0.991, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the incidence of PNAC (aRR: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-0.70, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and MBDP (aRR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.19-0.81, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029) in the SMOF group were lower than that in the MCT/LCT group. In addition, no significant differences were recorded in the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage &#x2265; 2), late-onset sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity and extrauterine growth retardation between the two groups (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The application of mixed oil emulsion in VPI or VLBWI can reduce the risk of plasma TB&#x2009;>&#x2009;5&#x2009;mg/dL, DB&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2&#x2009;mg/dL, ALP&#x2009;>&#x2009;900 IU/L, and TG&#x2009;>&#x2009;3.4&#x2009;mmol/L during hospitalization. SMOF has better lipid tolerance, reduces the incidence of PNAC and MBDP, and exerts more benefits in preterm infants with gestational age <&#x2009;28 weeks.
