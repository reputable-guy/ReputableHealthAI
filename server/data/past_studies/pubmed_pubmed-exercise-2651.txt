Study Title: High Cognitive Effort Prior to Velocity-Based Training Sessions Reduces Rate of Force Development but Not Maximum Strength Gains in Untrained Male Adults.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to analyze the chronic effect of high cognitive effort immediately before resistance exercise sessions on neuromuscular performance in untrained male adults. We used a mixed experimental design, with the group as between-participants factor and time as within-participants factor. Thirty-four participants were randomly assigned to two parallel groups: high cognitive effort (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) and control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17). Subjects in the control group were seated for 30&#x2009;min before the resistance exercise sessions, while the high cognitive effort group completed incongruent trials of the Stroop task until subjective mental fatigue was present immediately before resistance exercise sessions. Participants attended 45 sessions over 15&#x2009;weeks, consisting of three familiarizations, three baseline evaluations, 36 velocity-based training sessions, and three postexperiment evaluation sessions. Rate of force development (RFD) during the isometric mid-thigh pull, half back-squat 1-RM, and countermovement jump (CMJ) were measured before and after the 12-week intervention. A significant group &#xd7; time interaction effect was found for the average RFD at 0-250&#x2009;ms (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), with greater improvements for the control group than for the high cognitive effort group. There was no group &#xd7; time interaction for half back-squat 1-RM (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Also, there was no group &#xd7; time interaction for CMJ (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). In conclusion, repeated high cognitive effort immediately prior to resistance exercise sessions is a phenomenon that can induce greater early velocity loss and, consequently, impairs the improvements in RFD. However, this did not inhibit the increased performance for explosive strength and CMJ in male untrained adults. High cognitive effort before resistance exercise sessions should be avoided.
