Study Title: Impact and effect of preoperative short-term preoperative pulmonary-related training on patients with gastric cancer: a randomized controlled single center trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed is to evaluate the impact of pre- and postoperative pulmonary-related training, including respiratory and aerobic training, on postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) after radical resection of gastric cancer (GC). We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 121 participants who received a systematic, comprehensive, high-intensity pulmonary exercise regimen for 5 days preoperatively and at least 5 days postoperatively. The control group received standard preoperative care. We analyzed the occurrence of PPCs in both groups as the primary outcome RESULTS: A total of 43 of 121 participants (35.5%) were diagnosed as having PPCs, and the incidence of PPCs was markedly lower in the training group than in the control group (26.2% [16 of 61] vs 45.0% [27 of 60]; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.031). Moreover, the duration of the postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the training group (8.69&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.92 days) than the control group (9.57&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.16 days; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.020) and reduced hospitalization costs, amounting to &#x20ac;9605.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;&#x20ac;2556.26 in the training group and &#x20ac;10,594.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;&#x20ac;2560.7 in the control group (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.035). Our study established that a perioperative pulmonary-related training notably diminishes the incidence of PPCs, curtails the duration of hospitalization, and mitigates hospitalization expenses for patients undergoing GC surgery.
