Study Title: Exercise into Pain in Chronic Rotator Cuff-Related Shoulder Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial with 6-Month Follow-Up.

Study Summary:
Exercise therapy is the first-line treatment in rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP), and diverse types of exercise seem effective. However, it is not still clear if painful exercise should be allowed or avoided during exercises. The objective of this study was to investigate if exercise into pain is more effective than no pain in RCRSP. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a physiotherapy clinic in Belgium. Forty-three participants with chronic RCRSP were randomly allocated to G1 (exercising into pain) or G2 (exercising without pain) in a 12-week intervention with 6-month follow-up. Primary outcome was the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); secondary outcomes were pain intensity, fear-avoidance beliefs, fear of pain, quality of life, strength, and range of motion. Outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), after 9&#xa0;weeks (T1), 12&#xa0;weeks (T2), and 6 months (T3) from the first session and analysed with linear mixed models. No between-group difference in SPADI (time-by-group interaction, p = 0.25) up to 6 months was found, with mean difference (G1-G2) at T1 = 5.78 (CI95%: -3.43,14.59; p = 0.33), at T2 = 0.93 (CI95%: -7.20,9.05; p = 0.82), at T3 = 4.15 (CI95%: -2.61,10.92; p = 0.33). No between-group differences were found for any other outcomes. Pain provocation seems not to be necessary in RCRSP for achieving successful treatment effect in pain and disability reduction, fear-related beliefs, and quality of life up to 6 months.
