Study Title: The effect of adjunctive telmisartan treatment on psychopathology and cognition in patients with schizophrenia.

Study Summary:
This study examined the effect of adjunctive telmisartan on psychopathology and cognition in olanzapine- or clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. In a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder received either telmisartan (80&#xa0;mg once per day) or placebo. Psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and a neuropsychological battery was used to assess cognitive performance. Assessments for psychopathology and cognition were conducted at baseline and week 12. Fifty-four subjects were randomized, and 43 completed the study (22 in the telmisartan group, 21 in the placebo group). After 12-weeks of treatment, the telmisartan group had a significant decrease in PANSS total score compared withthe placebo group (mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD: - 4.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8.1 vs. 0.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7.5, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.038, SCohen's d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.57). There were no significant differences between the two groups in change from baseline to week 12 in PANSS subscale scores, SANS total score, or any cognitive measures (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.100). The present study suggests that adjunctive treatment with telmisartan may improve schizophrenia symptoms. Future trials with larger sample sizes and longer treatment durations are warranted.
