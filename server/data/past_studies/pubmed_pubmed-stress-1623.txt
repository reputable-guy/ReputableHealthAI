Study Title: The effect of crocin on movement disorders and oxidative DNA damage in Parkinson's disease: Insights from a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurological disorder in the elderly, manifests with distinctive movement disorders, including bradykinesia, resting tremor, and stiffness. With a progressive course, current treatment strategies primarily target symptomatic relief. Crocin is a chemical compound isolated from the dry stigma of Crocus sativus, and has demonstrated neuroprotective properties. This study explores the impact of crocin on movement disorders and neuronal oxidative DNA damage in PD patients. Conducted as a randomized, blinded, and controlled trial, this research focused on patients aged 30 to 80 with idiopathic PD. Using the second and third parts of the movement disorder society-unified PD rating scale (MDS-UPDRS), aspects of daily life activity and movement disorders were assessed before and after an 8-week intervention. Patients in the crocin groups received capsules containing 30&#xa0;mg of crocin twice daily. Additionally, the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxydiguanosine (8-OHdG) to urinary creatinine ratio (8-OHdG/uCr) was measured to evaluate neuronal oxidative DNA damage. Out of the initially evaluated 164 patients, 30 were randomly assigned to each group, with 53 subjects completing the study. Within-group analysis revealed a significant improvement in the second and third parts of MDS-UPDRS after 8 weeks of crocin intervention (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). However, the 8-OHdG/uCr did not show significant changes. The well-tolerated daily dose of 60&#xa0;mg of crocin demonstrated minimal side effects. This study establishes the efficacy of crocin in enhancing daily life activities and mitigating movement disorders, suggesting its potential as a supplementary intervention alongside conventional PD medications.
