Study Title: Construction and application of a home exercise rehabilitation management program for elderly stroke patients based on the Functional Independence Measure score.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to develop a home exercise rehabilitation management program for elderly stroke patients based on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score and assess its effectiveness through practical application. A prospective asynchronous controlled trial was conducted involving 290 elderly stroke patients, with 145 assigned to the control group and 145 to the intervention group. The control group received standard home rehabilitation instructions, while the intervention group followed a home exercise rehabilitation program guided by FIM scores. The program was developed through research group discussions, evidence-based literature review, and expert input. The efficacy of the program was evaluated by comparing self-care ability and exercise function between the two patient groups. After 4 and 8&#xa0;weeks of intervention, the motor assessment scale (MAS), Barthel Index scores and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of the intervention group were higher than those of the control group, and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) was lower than this of the control group (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The home exercise rehabilitation management program for elderly stroke patients based on FIM scores was developed in a scientifically sound manner. This program holds significant theoretical implications for enhancing the home exercise regimen of elderly stroke patients and facilitating the rehabilitation of their limb functions.
