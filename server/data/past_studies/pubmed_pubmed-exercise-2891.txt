Study Title: Exploring the Influence of Acid-Base Status on Athletic Performance during Simulated Three-Day 400 m Race.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the ability of highly trained athletes to consistently perform at their highest level during a simulated three-day 400 m race and to examine the impact of an alkaline diet associated with chronic consumption of bicarbonate-rich water or placebo on their blood metabolic responses before and after the three races. Twenty-two highly trained athletes, divided into two groups-one with an alkalizing diet and placebo water (PLA) and the other with an alkalizing diet and bicarbonate-rich water (BIC)-performed a 400 m race for three consecutive days. Performance metrics, urine and blood samples assessing acid-base balance, and indirect markers of neuro-muscular fatigue were measured before and after each 400 m race. The evolution of the Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) index and urinary pH highlights the combination of an alkalizing diet and bicarbonate-rich hydration, modifying the acid-base state (< 0.05). Athletes in the PLA group replicated the same level of performance during three consecutive daily races without an increase in fatigue-associated markers. Athletes experienced similar levels of metabolic perturbations during the three 400 m races, with improved lactate clearance 20 min after the third race compared to the first two (< 0.05). This optimization of the buffering capacity through ecological alkaline nutrition and hydration allowed athletes in the BIC group to improve their performance during the third 400 m race (< 0.01). This study highlights athletes' ability to replicate high-level performances over three consecutive days with the same extreme level of metabolic disturbances, and an alkaline diet combined with bicarbonate-rich water consumption appears to enhance performance in a 400 m race.
