Study Title: Acute ingestion of acetaminophen improves cognitive and repeated high intensity short-term maximal performance in well-trained female athletes: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study examined the effect of acute acetaminophen (ACTP) ingestion on physical performance during the 5 m shuttle run test (5mSRT), attention, mood states, and the perception of perceived exertion (RPE), pain (PP), recovery (PRS), and delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) in well-trained female athletes. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, fifteen well-trained female athletes (age 21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2 years, height 165&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6 cm, body mass 62&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5 kg) swallowed either 1.5 g of ACTP or 1.5 g of placebo. The profile of mood states (POMS) and digit cancellation (DCT) were assessed 45 min postingestion, and 5mSRT was performed 60 min postingestion. The RPE and PP were determined immediately after each 30-s repetition of the 5mSRT, and the PRS and DOMS were recorded at 5 min and 24 h post-5mSRT. For the 5mSRT, ACTP ingestion improved the greatest distance (+&#x2009;10.88%, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), total distance (+&#x2009;11.33%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0007) and fatigue index (+&#x2009;21.43%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003) compared to PLA. Likewise, the DCT score was better on the ACTP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0007) than on the PLA. RPE, PP, PRS, and DOMS scores were improved after ACTP ingestion (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01 for all comparisons) compared to PLA. POMS scores were enhanced with ACTP ingestion compared to PLA (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). In conclusion, this study indicates that acute acetaminophen ingestion can improve repeated high intensity short-term maximal performance, attention, mood states, and perceptions of exertion, pain, recovery, and muscle soreness in well-trained female athletes, suggesting potential benefits for their overall athletic performance and mood state.
