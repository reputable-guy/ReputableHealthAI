Study Title: Psychological Status, Compliance, Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, and Nerve Growth Factor Levels of Patients with Depression after Augmented Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a cost-effective psychosocial program that prevents relapse/recurrence in major depression. The present study aimed to analyze the effects of augmented MBCT along with standard treatment dominated by pharmacotherapy on psychological state, compliance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) expression levels in patients with depression. A total of 160 eligible patients with depression in The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were included in this study. The study randomly assigned the patients to the experimental group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;80) and control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;80). All participants were assessed with the questionnaires including the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES), Self-Acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ), and Stigma Scale (Scale of Stigma in People with Mental Illness, SSPM). The serum levels of BDNF and NGF were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After 8 weeks of treatment, the experimental group showed significant lower HAMD-17 score, higher RSES, and SAQ score, as well as lower SSPM score compared with the control group (< 0.01). Furthermore, ELISA revealed that the serum levels of BDNF and NGF remarkably increased in the experimental group after treatment (< 0.001). Our data showed that augmented MBCT combined with pharmacotherapy contributed to improvement on patients' psychological state, compliance, and disease recurrence.
