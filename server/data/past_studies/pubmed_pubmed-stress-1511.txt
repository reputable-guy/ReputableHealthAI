Study Title: Aesthetic Radiofrequency Associated withSupplementation is Safe and Reduces Oxidative Stress in Women: Randomized, and Double-Blind Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
The objective were to evaluate the effects of supplementation of standardized dry extract of Rosmarinus officinalis (RO) and the application of aesthetic radiofrequency on the oxidative stress markers catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), non-protein thiols (NP-SH), and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and the biochemical markers triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (TGO/AST), pyruvic-glutamic transaminase (TGP/ALT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), and creatinine. This study included 32 women received the aesthetic therapy to reduce localized fat. They were divided into the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) receiving placebo capsules and the intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) subdivided into Group A, B, and C, each with eight members receiving supplementation with 100, 500, and 1000&#x2005;mg/day of standardized dry extract of RO, respectively. The Universal Trial Number (UTN) - U1111-1274-6255. Supplementation with RO (500&#x2005;mg/day) demonstrated a reduction in oxidative stress (quantified with through a significant increase in NP-SH and a reduction in SOD and CAT enzymes). The radiofrequency aesthetic treatment did not promote an increase in oxidative stress; however, it caused significant changes in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and creatinine. RO is a plant with antioxidant effects and its oral consumption is safe in selected women subjects in hepatic and renal markers.
