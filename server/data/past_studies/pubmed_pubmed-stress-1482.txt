Study Title: [Multidimensional supportive psychological intervention in clinical practice teaching of andrological nursing].

Study Summary:
To examine the application of a novel pedagogical approach multidimensional supportive psychological intervention (MSPI) in the clinical practice teaching of andrological nursing care. Using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), we assessed the psychology of 100 nursing interns about to enter clinical practice in the Department of Andrology from December 2021 to December 2022. We equally randomized the subjects into an experimental and a control group, the former receiving MSPI and the latter trained on the conventional teaching model without any psychological support intervention. Compared with the baseline, the HAMD scores were significantly decreased in the experimental group after intervention (12.4&#xb1;2.1 vs 8.9&#xb1;2.4, P<0.01), but increased in the controls (13.1&#xb1;1.8 vs 14.7&#xb1;1.9, P<0.01); the skill scores dramatically increased in the experimental group (82.6&#xb1;4.7 vs 91.2&#xb1;2.4, P<0.01), but decreased in the control group after intervention (81.0&#xb1;3.5 vs 80.4&#xb1;2.7, P = 0.28). MSPI can significantly enhance the learning enthusiasm of nursing students in a short period, reduce their psychological stress and improve teaching outcomes. This approach, combining psychology with teaching, can also strengthen the mental resilience of nursing students and better confront them with future professional challenges.
