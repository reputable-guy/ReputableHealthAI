Study Title: Low energy availability increases immune cell formation of reactive oxygen species and impairs exercise performance in female endurance athletes.

Study Summary:
The effects of low energy availability (LEA) on the immune system are poorly understood. This study examined the effects of 14 days of LEA on immune cell redox balance and inflammation at rest and in response to acute exercise, and exercise performance in female athletes. Twelve female endurance athletes (age: 26.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;yrs, maximum oxygen uptake (V&#x2d9;O): 55.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.1 mL&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;min&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;kg) were included in a randomized, single-blinded crossover study. They were allocated to begin with either 14 days of optimal energy availability diet (OEA, 52&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2&#xa0;kcal&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;kg fat free mass (FFM)&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;day) or LEA diet (22&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2&#xa0;kcal&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;kg FFM&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;day), followed by 3 days of refueling (OEA) with maintained training volume. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, and plasma obtained at rest before and after each dietary period. The PBMCs were used for analysis of mitochondrial respiration and HOemission and specific proteins. Exercise performance was assessed on cycle by a 20-min time trial and time to exhaustion at an intensity corresponding to &#x223c;110&#xa0;% V&#x2d9;O). LEA was associated with a 94&#xa0;% (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003) increase in PBMC NADPH oxidase 2 protein content, and a 22&#xa0;% (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013) increase in systemic cortisol. LEA also caused an alteration of several inflammatory related proteins (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Acute exercise augmented HOemission in PBMCs (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) following both OEA and LEA, but to a greater extent following LEA. LEA also reduced the mobilization of white blood cells with acute exercise. After LEA, performance was reduced in both exercise tests (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), and the reduced time trial performance remained after the 3 days of refueling (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). 14 days of LEA in female athletes increased cortisol levels and had a pronounced effect on the immune system, including increased capacity for ROS production, altered plasma inflammatory proteome and lowered exercise induced mobilization of leukocytes. Furthermore, LEA resulted in a sustained impairment in exercise performance.
