Study Title: Effects of Upper Limb Control on the Less-Affected Side on Upper Limb Function, Respiration, Balance, and Activities of Daily Living in Stroke.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effects of upper limb control exercises on upper limb function, respiration, balance, and activities of daily living in patients with stroke.The 28 patients who met the selection criteria were randomly assigned to two groups of 14 patients each. Subsequently, upper limb control exercises using real-time feedback were applied. The same interventional exercise was applied to both the less-affected and affected limbs of the study participants, who were classified into a less-affected side upper limb control group and an affected side upper limb control exercise group. Interventional exercises, 30 min each, were performed five times weekly for 4 weeks, and follow-up examinations were performed 2 weeks after the end of exercise. Electronic muscle strength measurements and an electronic goniometer were used to evaluate upper limb function. A spirometer was used to measure respiration. Balance ability was evaluated using a force plate pressure distribution measuring system with a sensor that detects the movement of the body center on the ground. Daily life movements were evaluated using the Korean version of the modified Barthel index.When examining the results, the upper limb function on the paralyzed side showed an increase in the electromyographic strength of shoulder joint depression and flexion angle. Improvements were also observed in respiration (forced vital capacity [L] and forced expiratory volume in 1 s [L]), balance (95% confidence ellipse area [mm] and center of pressure displacement [mm]), and daily life activities, all of which showed statistically significant differences in the time &#xd7; group interaction effect (< 0.05).Thus, it was found that the upper limb control exercise on the less-affected side had a significant effect when the exercise was performed together with treatment on the affected side in patients with stroke. It is anticipated that this study will provide basic data for evaluating both the trunk and upper limbs of the less-affected and affected sides.
