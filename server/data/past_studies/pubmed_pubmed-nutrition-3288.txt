Study Title: Effects of food bar chewing duration on the physiologic, metabolic, and perceptual responses to moderate-intensity running.

Study Summary:
Chewing duration can affect food particle size, gastric processing, and postprandial glycemia, but these effects have not been investigated with exercise. This study examined how the chewing duration of a food bar impacts glycemic and metabolic responses, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, psychological affect, and performance during endurance running. This randomized, unblinded, crossover study had 15 males (35.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.4&#xa0;years, VO: 56.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.2&#xa0;ml/kg/min) attend three laboratory visits. Visit 1 required a VOtest, 10&#xa0;min familiarization run at 60% VO, and familiarization time-to-exhaustion (TTE) test (10&#xa0;min at 90% VO, followed by TTE at 100% VO). Visits 2 and 3 consisted of a 60&#xa0;min run at 60% VO, followed by TTE testing. Participants were fed 45&#xa0;g of a bar (180&#xa0;kcal, 4&#xa0;g fat, 33&#xa0;g carbohydrate, 3&#xa0;g protein, 1&#xa0;g fiber) in 9&#xa0;g servings 30&#xa0;min before running, and 27&#xa0;g of bar in 9&#xa0;g servings at three timepoints during the 60&#xa0;min run. Participants consumed the servings in 20 (20CHEW) or 40 (40CHEW) masticatory cycles, at 1 chew/second. Outcomes included blood glucose, substrate use, GI symptoms, perceived exertion (RPE), overall feeling, and TTE. Post-prandial blood glucose, GI symptoms, and RPE increased over time, but there were no significant between-condition or condition-by-time effects. TTE showed no significant between-condition effect (20CHEW: 288&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;133&#xa0;s; 40CHEW: 335&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;299&#xa0;s; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.240). Overall feeling demonstrated a time-by-condition effect (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), suggesting possible better maintenance over time with 40CHEW. Cumulatively, the results suggest that extended chewing minimally impacts physiology, perceptions, and performance during 60&#xa0;min moderate-intensity running.
