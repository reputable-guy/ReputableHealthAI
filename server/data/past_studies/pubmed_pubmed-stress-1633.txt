Study Title: Effects of Hermetia illucens larvae meal and astaxanthin on intestinal histology and expression of tight junction proteins in weaned piglets.

Study Summary:
The weaning phase in piglets causes significant physiological stress, disrupts intestinal integrity and reduces productivity, necessitating strategies to improve intestinal health and nutrient absorption. While current research highlights the role of diet in mitigating these adverse effects, identifying effective dietary supplements remains a challenge. This study evaluated the effects of Hermetia illucens (HI) larvae meal and astaxanthin (AST) on the intestinal histology of weaned piglets. In a controlled experiment, 48 weaned piglets were divided into six groups and received varying levels of HI larval meal (2.5% and 5%) and AST in their diets. The methodology involved comprehensive histological examinations of the small intestine, assessing absorption area, villi elongation, crypt depth, goblet cells, enterocytes and expression of ileal tight junction (TJ) proteins. The study found that HI larval meal significantly improved nutrient absorption in the jejunum and ileum (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), thereby enhancing feed conversion. AST supplementation increased the number of enterocytes (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Both HI larval meal and AST positively affected intestinal morphology and function, increasing muscularis muscle mass and villi elongation (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001 and p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05, respectively). The 2.5% HI meal improved the villi length to crypt depth ratio and slightly increased the goblet cell count (both p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Ki-67 antibody analysis showed increased cell proliferation in the duodenal and jejunal crypts, particularly with the 2.5% HI meal (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Insect meal did not affect TJ protein expression, indicating that it had no effect on intestinal permeability. These findings suggest that HI larval meal and AST can enhance the intestinal wellness and productivity of weaned piglets.
