Study Title: The anatomy of enjoyment: the flow experience and cardiac surgery.

Study Summary:
In a time of record levels of physician burnout coupled with a global pandemic, protecting physician wellness is critical. The experience of cognitive flow has been found to enhance both wellness and performance. Although flow has been vastly explored in other fields including elite sport, it has not been deeply investigated or applied in cardiac surgery. Here we discuss flow and flow-promoting techniques employed in other fields that may be beneficial within cardiac surgery. Flow is a prevalent experience among surgeons, amplified during operations. Possible strategies to cultivate flow may be separated into individual skills training, such as mindfulness practice and stress management, institutional changes, such as ensuring adequate resources and protected spaces, and strategies targeting the intersectionality of individuals and systems, such as how workplace culture shapes an individual's experience. These techniques may be applicable within cardiac surgery, especially in training. Flow has been identified as a key component of a happy and meaningful life, and a potential protector against burnout. Harnessing the benefits of flow may help promote flourishing, particularly in demanding fields, such as cardiac surgery.
