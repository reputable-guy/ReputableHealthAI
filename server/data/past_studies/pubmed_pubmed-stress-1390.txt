Study Title: Wet military uniforms pose low risk of hypothermia while static in mild cold air.

Study Summary:
Wet clothing is less insulative than dry clothing and consequently increases heat loss in cold air. Tactical necessity can render removal of wet clothing impossible and/or require Warfighters to remain static to avoid detection, limiting heat production and posing a threat of hypothermia (core temperature&#xa0;<35&#xa0;&#xb0;C). This study aimed to characterize body temperatures and evaluate hypothermia risk while statically exposed to 5&#xa0;&#xb0;C air wearing three wet military uniforms. Further, low-speed loaded walking was evaluated as a strategy to raise end-static temperatures. Twelve adults (11&#xa0;M, 1&#xa0;F) randomly completed three wet-cold trials wearing either the Improved Hot Weather Combat Uniform (IHWCU), Army Combat Uniform (ACU), or ACU with silk-weight base layer (ACU+). Each trial involved 180&#x2009;min of cold air (5.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.3&#xa0;&#xb0;C, 0.8&#x2009;m&#xb7;s) exposure after a clothed 2&#x2009;min head-out immersion (34.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.2&#xa0;&#xb0;C). Volunteers were static for 60&#x2009;min followed by 120&#x2009;min of walking with a rucksack. Rectal temperature () area under the curve did not differ among the three wet uniforms when static (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.431) withincreasing, rather than decreasing, across the 60&#x2009;min (IHWCU: +0.26&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.19&#xa0;&#xb0;C, ACU: +0.37&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.21&#xa0;&#xb0;C, ACU+: +0.36&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.20&#xa0;&#xb0;C). Hypothermia risk with 60&#x2009;min static wet-cold exposure therefore appears minimal, regardless of the military uniform worn, in an otherwise low stress cohort. End-static finger temperatures (IHWCU: 9.48&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.30&#xa0;&#xb0;C, ACU: 9.99&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.82&#xa0;&#xb0;C, ACU+: 9.27&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.66&#xa0;&#xb0;C,&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.999) were reduced by &#x223c;20-23&#xa0;&#xb0;C posing a considerable dexterity concern. Heat production of &#x223c;210&#x2009;W&#xb7;mappeared sufficient to begin to reverse negative cumulative heat storage and initiate slight elevations of rectal and peripheral temperatures, although finger temperatures increased&#xa0;<2&#xa0;&#xb0;C after 120&#x2009;min.
