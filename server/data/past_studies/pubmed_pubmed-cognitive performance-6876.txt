Study Title: Postprandial effects of breakfast glycaemic index on cognitive performance among young, healthy adults: A crossover clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the postprandial effects of high and low glycaemic index (GI) breakfasts on cognitive performance in young, healthy adults.A crossover clinical trial including 40 young, healthy adults (aged 20-40 years, 50% females) recruited from primary healthcare centres in Salamanca, Spain. Verbal memory, phonological fluency, attention, and executive functions were examined 0, 60, and 120&#x2005;minutes after consuming a low GI (LGI), high GI (HGI), or water breakfast. Every subject tried each breakfast variant, in a randomized order, separated by a washout period of 7 days, for a total of 3 weeks.A significant interaction between the type of breakfast consumed and immediate verbal memory was identified (<.05). We observed a trend towards better performance in verbal memory (delayed and immediate), attention, and phonological fluency following an LGI breakfast.Cognitive performance during the postprandial phase in young, healthy adults was minimally affected by the GI of breakfast. The potential for breakfast's GI modulation to improve short- and long-term cognitive functioning requires further research.
