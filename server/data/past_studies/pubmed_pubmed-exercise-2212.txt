Study Title: The Role of Biomarkers in Monitoring Chronic Fatigue Among Male Professional Team Athletes: A Systematic Review.

Study Summary:
This systematic review synthesizes evidence on biomarker responses to physiological loads in professional male team sport athletes, providing insights into induced fatigue states. Structured searches across major databases yielded 28 studies examining various biomarkers in elite team sport players. Studies evaluated muscle damage markers, anabolic/catabolic hormones reflecting metabolic strain, inflammatory markers indicating immune activity and tissue damage, immunological markers tied to infection risk, and oxidative stress markers showing redox imbalances from excessive physiological load. Responses were examined in official matches and training across competitive seasons. The evidence shows that professional team sports induce significant alterations in all studied biomarkers, reflecting measurable physiological strain, muscle damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, and immunosuppression during intensive exercise. These effects tend to be larger and more prolonged after official matches compared to training. Reported recovery time courses range from 24-h to several days post-exercise. Monitoring biomarkers enables quantifying cumulative fatigue and physiological adaptations to training/competition loads, helping to optimize performance while mitigating injury and overtraining. Key biomarkers include creatine kinase, testosterone, cortisol, testosterone/cortisol ratio, salivary immunoglobulin-A, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Further research should extend biomarker monitoring to cover psychological stress and affective states alongside physiological metrics for deeper insight into athlete wellness and readiness.
