Study Title: Effects of Oral Nutritional Supplement with &#x3b2;-Hydroxy-&#x3b2;-methylbutyrate (HMB) on Biochemical and Hematological Indices in Community-Dwelling Older Adults at Risk of Malnutrition: Findings from the SHIELD Study.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition may result in abnormal biochemical and hematological indices. This planned prespecified analysis investigated the effects of a specialized oral nutritional supplement (ONS) on biochemical and hematological indices in community-dwelling older adults at risk of malnutrition. In the Strengthening Health in ELDerly through nutrition (SHIELD) study, 811 older adults aged 65 years and above took part in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. Participants were randomly allocated to either a complete and balanced specialized ONS (each serving provides 262 kcal, 10.5 g protein, 7.75 &#xb5;g vitamin D, and 0.74 g calcium &#x3b2;-hydroxy-&#x3b2;-methylbutyrate) and dietary counselling (intervention group) or a placebo and dietary counselling (placebo group). Both groups consumed study products twice a day for 180 days. Data were collected at baseline, day 90, and day 180. Blood analysis results at follow-up visits were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariance with adjustments for confounders. Overall, when compared with the placebo group, the intervention group showed significantly greater urea (6.0 mmol/L vs. 5.4 mmol/L,< 0.001), urea to creatinine ratio (4.39 vs. 4.26,< 0.001), prealbumin (24.9 mg/dL vs. 24.0 mg/dL,< 0.001), vitamin B(480.0 pmol/L vs. 420.1 pmol/L,< 0.001), and globulin levels (26.8 g/L vs. 26.5 g/L,= 0.032). The intervention group also had a significantly higher absolute reticulocyte count (62.0 &#xd7; 10/&#xb5;L vs. 58.2 &#xd7; 10/&#xb5;L, overall< 0.001) and mean platelet volume (10.0 fL vs. 9.9 fL, overall= 0.003). Furthermore, significant improvements were seen in total protein at day 90 (71.7 g/L vs. 71.1 g/L,= 0.017) and in absolute monocyte count at day 90 (0.50 &#xd7; 10/&#xb5;L vs. 0.47 &#xd7; 10/&#xb5;L,= 0.009) in the intervention group. In conclusion, daily consumption of a specialized ONS for six months led to significant improvements in biochemical and hematological indices in community-dwelling older adults at risk of malnutrition.
