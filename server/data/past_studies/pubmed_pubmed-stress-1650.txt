Study Title: The impact of hydrogen inhalation therapy on blood reactive oxygen species levels: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) play a key role in physiological processes. However, the imbalance between ROS and antioxidants in favor of the former causes oxidative stress linked to numerous pathologies. Due to its unique attributes, including distinguished permeability and selective antioxidant capability, molecular hydrogen (H) has become an essential therapeutic agent. Hydrogen Inhalation Therapy (HIT) has come to light as a promising strategy to counteract oxidative stress. In this randomized controlled study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of HIT in reducing blood ROS levels. 37 participants with elevated ROS levels (d-ROMs value&#xa0;>&#xa0;350 U.CARR) were enrolled in the study. Participants were divided into test and control groups. The test group participants received HIT, and then their blood ROS levels were measured immediately post-treatment and after 24&#xa0;h. Their results were compared to those of the control group participants who did not undergo HIT. The test group demonstrated a significant reduction in blood ROS levels after the treatment. These findings suggested the efficacy of HIT in reducing oxidative stress.
