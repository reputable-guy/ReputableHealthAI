Study Title: Orientation of New Graduate Registered Nurses Postpandemic: A Follow-up Study.

Study Summary:
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the rate of nurses leaving practice, which has highlighted the importance of new graduate nurse orientation. The literature has limited recommendations for orientation strategies. The goal of this study was to determine what changes have occurred in orientation processes for new graduate nurses since the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of nurse leaders was used to examine changes and opportunities. Leaders are more intentional with orientation processes, including frequent check-ins and increased discussion of time management, difficult conversations, and workplace violence. Individualized orientation plans are used, along with a stronger focus on nurse wellness. Recommendations include continuing support after orientation is completed and partnering with academia to provide content on stress management and wellness. Innovative and cost-effective transition to practice programs are needed to meet the needs of new nurses..
