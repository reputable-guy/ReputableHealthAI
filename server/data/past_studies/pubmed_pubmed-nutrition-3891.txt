Study Title: Structured lactation support and human donor milk for German NICUs-Protocol on an intervention design based on a multidimensional status quo and needs assessment (Neo-MILK).

Study Summary:
Mother's own milk is the best nutrition for every newborn and especially for vulnerable infants such as preterm infants with a very low birth weight below 1,500 grams (VLBW). If no MOM is available, human donor milk is the alternative of choice. Mothers of preterm born infants face challenging conditions that impair sufficient milk production. For this reason, it is particularly important to provide structural lactation support and, at the same time, to promote the establishment of human donor milk banks. Via a multidisciplinary approach the Neo-MILK study will develop an intervention for structured breastfeeding and lactation support. This will be based on a comprehensive status quo and needs assessment. In addition, the implementation of human donor milk banks (HDMB) will be supported by the development of standards. Intervention development is participatory, involving different disciplines and stakeholders. All surveys are subject to approval by the ethics committee. During the course of the project, the results will be communicated to the scientific community and the general public via publications, the project homepage and social media.
