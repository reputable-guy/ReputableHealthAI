Study Title: Results of a randomized waitlist-controlled trial of online cognitive behavioral sex therapy and online mindfulness-based sex therapy for hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction in women.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of two internet-delivered psychological treatments for hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction (HSDD) in women: internet-based cognitive behavioral sex therapy (iCBST) and internet-based mindfulness-based sex therapy (iMBST). Women with HSDD were randomly assigned to one of three groups: iCBST, iMBST, or a waitlist control group. The interventions consisted of eight modules delivered via an e-health platform with e-coach support to enhance adherence. Sexual desire and sexual distress were assessed at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups (active conditions only). Per protocol, of the 266 consenting women, 106 were randomized to iCBST (= 36.1,= 10.3), 106 to iMBST (= 36.4,= 0.2), and 54 to the control condition (= 36.7,= 11.0). Primary analyses utilized an intention-to-treat approach with linear mixed models. Clinical significance, assessed with clinical cutoffs and the reliable change index, was examined for active conditions. Compared to the control condition, both iCBST and iMBST demonstrated significant improvements in sexual desire and sexual distress at 3-month (= 0.89-1.14) and 6-month follow-up (= 0.74-1.18). Results were sustained at 12-month follow-up, with 35 and 41% demonstrating reliable improvements and additional 20 and 24% achieving clinically significant improvements in sexual desire after iCBST and iMBST. Regarding sexual distress, 49 and 42% exhibited reliable change, with an additional 37%-42% achieving clinically significant improvements. Results provide support for the overall long-term efficacy of psychological therapies in treating HSDD in women. However, fewer than one in four women showed improvements in sexual desire that met the threshold for clinically significant change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).
