Study Title: The Effects of Caloric Restriction and Clinical Psychological Intervention on the Interplay of Gut Microbial Composition and Stress in Women.

Study Summary:
Both mental and metabolic disorders are steadily becoming more prevalent, increasing interest in non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions targeting both types of disorders. However, the combined effect of diet and psychological interventions on the gut microbiome and mental health outcomes remains underexplored. Thus, in this study, we randomized 41 women into two caloric restriction (CR) dietary groups, namely very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) and F.X. Mayr diet (FXM). The patients were then further randomized to either receive clinical psychological intervention (CPI) or no CPI. Blood and fecal samples were collected before and after two weeks of CR. Psychometric outcomes were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Brief Symptom Index (BSI), and Burnout Dimension Inventory (BODI). Stool samples underwent 16S-rRNA sequencing. Upon two weeks of CR, &#x3b1;-diversity decreased overall and longitudinal PERMANOVA models revealed significant shifts in &#x3b2;-diversity according to diet, CPI, age, and body-mass-index. Furthermore,,, anddecreased in abundance. However, thegenus was enriched solely in FXM. CPI had a negligible effect on the microbiome. Dimension reduction models revealed clusters of taxa which distinctly associated with psychometric outcomes. Members of thefamily were linked to favorable psychometric outcomes after two weeks of CR. Despite &#x3b1;-diversity reductions after CR, enrichment ofspp., solely seen in FXM, correlated with improved psychometric outcomes. This study suggests a promising direction for future interventions targeting mental health through gut microbial modulation.
