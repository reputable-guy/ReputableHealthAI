Study Title: Ultrasound-guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca compartment block and early postoperative analgesia after total hip arthroplasty: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Hip replacement surgery can be painful; postoperative analgesia is crucial for comfort and to facilitate recovery. Regional anaesthesia can reduce pain and postoperative opioid requirements. The role of ultrasound-guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca block for analgesia after elective total hip arthroplasty is not well defined. This randomised trial evaluated its analgesic efficacy. Consenting participants (134) scheduled for elective primary total hip arthroplasty under spinal anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block with ropivacaine 0.5% or sham block with saline. The primary outcome was opioid consumption in the first 24 h after surgery. Additional outcomes included pain scores at 4, 8, 12, and 16 h, opioid-related side-effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritis), ability to perform physiotherapy on the first postoperative day, and physiotherapist-assessed quadriceps weakness. There were no significant differences in 24-h opioid consumption (block vs sham block, mean difference&#xa0;-3.2 mg oral morphine equivalent, 95% confidence interval&#xa0;-15.3 to 8.1 mg oral morphine equivalent, P=0.55) or any other prespecified outcomes. In patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty, ultrasound-guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca block with ropivacaine did not confer a significant opioid-sparing effect compared with sham block. There were no differences in other secondary outcomes including pain scores, opioid-related side-effects, or ability to perform physiotherapy on the first postoperative day. www. gov (NCT03069183).
