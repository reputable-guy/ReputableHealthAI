Study Title: Effectiveness of Mulligan Mobilization Technique and Core Stabilization Exercises in Female Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Single-Blind Study.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the Mulligan mobilization (MM) technique and Core stabilization (CS) exercises added to the conventional physiotherapy (CP) program in female patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The study included 42 female patients diagnosed with bilateral KOA. Participants were randomly divided into 3 groups as CP group (mean age: 57.79 &#xb1; 7.43 years), MM group (mean age: 56.14 &#xb1; 6.95 years), and CS group (mean age: 54.36 &#xb1; 6.56 years). They were divided into 3 groups and treated 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. Pain intensity, range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength were evaluated with visual analog scale, universal goniometer, and handheld dynamometer, respectively. Balance, aerobic capacity, and functional level were assessed with 30-second sit-to-stand test, 6-minute walk test, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The quality of life of the participants was evaluated with the Nottingham Health Profile. After treatment, significant improvement was achieved in the all parameters evaluated in the groups (P < .05). CS was found to be more effective in reducing resting pain intensity than the other two treatment approaches (P = .001). It was observed that MM technique increased knee flexion ROM more (P = .001). There was no superiority of MM group and CS group over each other in balance, functional level, aerobic capacity, and quality of life assessments (P > .05). Our study showed that CP, MM technique, and CS exercises were effective treatment approaches in the management of KOA in female patients. Results revealed that the MM technique was more effective in increasing knee flexion ROM, and the CS exercise was more effective in reducing resting pain intensity in female patients with KOA.
