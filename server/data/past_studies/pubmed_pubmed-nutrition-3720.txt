Study Title: The Effects of a Web-Based Interactive Nurse Support Program Based on the Health Promotion Model on Healthy Living Behaviors and Self-Efficacy in Patients Who Regained Weight after Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study was conducted in order to determine the effects of web-based interactive nursing support program prepared in line with Health Promotion Model (HPM) on healthy lifestyle behaviors and self-efficacy of patients who regained weight following metabolic and bariatric surgery. A total of 62 patients with a history of weight regain at least two years after metabolic and bariatric surgery were divided into intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) and control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) groups by stratified randomization. The intervention group was given a web-based interactive nurse support program based on HPM for 10&#xa0;weeks and followed up by telephone 12 times (every two weeks) in 6&#xa0;months. No attempt was made to the control group during the study. The data were collected a total of 3 times before the training, in the 12week and in the 6month. In the last test after the web-based interactive nurse support program and telephone follow-up, the difference was found to be statistically significant in terms of BMI, healthy lifestyle behaviors, eating behaviors, and general self-efficacy mean scores of the patients in the intervention group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In addition, after the study, it was determined that the physical activity, nutrition, spiritual development, emotional eating and the Dutch Eating Behavior scales total score averages and Self-Efficacy Scale total score averages of the intervention group changed positively compared to the control group, and this change was statistically significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was no difference between the groups in the mean scores of health responsibility, interpersonal relationships, stress, restrictive eating, external eating and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors-II Scale (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). It can be stated that the web-based interactive nurse support program based on HPM is applicable in patients who regain weight after metabolic and bariatric surgery, and it contributes positively to the healthy lifestyle behaviors, BMI, eating behaviors, and general self-efficacy of these patients. In order to ensure the continuity of post-operative patient follow-up, it is recommended to increase the importance of telephone counseling and to establish follow-up program based on the HPM.
