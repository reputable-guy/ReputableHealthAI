Study Title: Effects of Cornus mas L. on anthropometric and biochemical parameters among metabolic associated fatty liver disease patients: Randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Cornus mas L. (Cornelian cherry, CM) fruits have been utilized for decades in numerous European and Asian countries as traditional cuisine and folk medicine. CM has antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, and hypolipidemic activities due to its rich bioactive compounds, and CM fruits and other parts have been used for the prevention and treatment of a diverse variety of diseases in folk medicine. Obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation are strongly associated with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), therefore, CM may be hope for MAFLD patients. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of lyophilized CM fruit powder with/without diet therapy on biochemical parameters and anthropometric measurements in patients with MAFLD. This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 87 patients with MAFLD and 21 healthy individuals. Patients were randomly assigned into 4 groups: group-1 receiving 30&#xa0;g/d lyophilized CM fruit powder plus diet therapy, group-2 receiving only diet therapy, group-3 receiving only 30&#xa0;g/d lyophilized CM fruit powder, and group-4 had not undertaken any pharmacological treatment and diet therapy or lyophilized CM fruit powder for 8 weeks. Biochemical parameters, and anthropometric measurements at baseline and after the intervention were taken. After 8 weeks of intervention, a significant decrease in body weight, body mass index, body fat mass, waist and hip circumferences, fasting blood glucose, insulin, hbA1c, liver enzymes, total triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol were found in group-1, 2 and 3. Lyophilized CM fruit powder in addition to diet therapy and only diet therapy had a positive and similar effect on anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters in MAFLD patients. Furthermore, only lyophilized CM fruit powder improved glycemic parameters. Therefore, lyophilized CM fruit powder may be beneficial for adult patients with MAFLD.
