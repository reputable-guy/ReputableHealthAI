Study Title: Nutritional strategies for correcting low glucose values in patients with postbariatric hypoglycaemia: A randomized controlled three-arm crossover trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the efficacy of nutritional hypoglycaemia correction strategies in postbariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). In a randomized, controlled, three-arm crossover trial, eight post-RYGB adults (mean [SD] 7.0 [1.4] years since surgery) with PBH ingested a solid mixed meal (584&#x2009;kcal, 85&#x2009;g carbohydrates, 21&#x2009;g fat, 12&#x2009;g protein) to induce hypoglycaemia on three separate days. Upon reaching plasma glucose of less than 3.0&#x2009;mmol/L, hypoglycaemia was corrected with 15&#x2009;g of glucose (G15), 5&#x2009;g of glucose (G5) or a protein bar (P10, 10&#x2009;g of protein) in random order. The primary outcome was percentage of time spent in the target plasma glucose range (3.9-5.5&#x2009;mmol/L) during 40&#x2009;minutes after correction. Postcorrection time spent in the target glucose range did not differ significantly between the interventions (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.161). However, postcorrection time with glucose less than 3.9&#x2009;mmol/L was lower after G15 than P10 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007), whereas time spent with glucose more than 5.5&#x2009;mmol/L, peak glucose and insulin 15&#x2009;minutes postcorrection were higher after G15 than G5 and P10 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). Glucagon 15&#x2009;minutes postcorrection was higher after P10 than after G15 and G5 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.003, respectively). G15 resulted in rebound hypoglycaemia (<&#x2009;3.0&#x2009;mmol/L) in three of eight cases (38%), while no rebound hypoglycaemia occurred with G5 and P10. Correcting hypoglycaemia with 15&#x2009;g of glucose should be reconsidered in post-RYGB PBH. A lower dose appears to sufficiently increase glucose levels outside the critical range in most cases, and complementary nutrients (e.g. proteins) may provide glycaemia-stabilizing benefits.
