Study Title: Remote exercise services for people with cystic fibrosis: experiences and perceptions from people with cystic fibrosis and members of cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary teams.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to explore the experiences and perceptions of people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) and multidisciplinary team (MDT) members on remote exercise services (RES) and to inform recommendations for future RES. Participants were recruited from an adult CF centre and through social media. Individual online semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. Themes from MDT members:Themes from PwCF: Participants' overall perceptions towards RES were positive, and perceived benefits of RES included time and cost saving, improving work efficiency, and having peer support. Perceived barriers to RES were largely technological or related to lacking visual cues. Perceived recommendations to future RES included personalising exercise options, developing user-friendly platforms, and providing funding for buying equipment.
