Study Title: Effect of acupuncture for temporomandibular disorders: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are the leading cause of pain and disability among frequently occurring facial pain and the second leading cause of musculoskeletal conditions. We examined whether acupuncture could alleviate pain intensity in patients with TMD. Sixty participants with TMD were randomly assigned (ratio 1:1) to receive three acupuncture or sham acupuncture sessions weekly for 4&#x2009;weeks. The primary outcome was the change in the mean weekly pain intensity from baseline to week 4. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included proportion of participants with &#x2265;30% or &#x2265;50% reduction in pain intensity, change in jaw opening and movement, graded chronic pain scale, jaw functional limitations scale-20-item, depression, anxiety and stress scales-21, Pittsburgh sleep quality index at week 4 and 8, and the pressure pain threshold and surface electromyography at week 4. The acupuncture group showed significantly reduced pain intensity compared to the sham group at week 4 (-1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.32 to -0.65; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and week 8 (-1.23, 95% CI: -2.11 to -0.54; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Acupuncture's effectiveness surpassed sham's at 4&#x2009;weeks and lasted 8&#x2009;weeks. Participants in the acupuncture group experienced significantly greater improvements in the 30% and 50% response rate, jaw opening and movement, GCPS, JFLS-20, DASS-21 and PSQI than those in the sham acupuncture group. There were no significant between-group differences in PPT and sEMG. In summary, acupuncture provided marked pain relief and improvement in physical and emotional function for patients with TMD compared with sham acupuncture.
