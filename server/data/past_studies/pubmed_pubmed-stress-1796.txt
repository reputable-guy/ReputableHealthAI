Study Title: Scalp Cooling in Preventing Persistent Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Current studies of the efficacy of scalp cooling are limited by short-term duration. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of scalp cooling in reducing persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (PCIA) 6 months after chemotherapy. We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial comparing scalp cooling versus control in newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer stages I-III scheduled to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with curative intent between December 2020 and August 2021. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to scalp cooling or usual clinical practice. The primary outcome was PCIA 6 months after chemotherapy. Hair thickness and density were measured using Folliscope 5.0. CIA-related distress was assessed using the CIA distress scale (CADS), with a higher score reflecting higher stress. The proportion of patients with PCIA at 6 months was 13.5% (12/89) in the scalp-cooling group and 52.0% (26/50) in the control group. The average difference in the change in hair thickness from baseline between the scalp-cooling and control groups was 9.0 &#x3bc;m in favor of the intervention group. The average difference in the change in hair density between intervention and control at the end of the study was -3.3 hairs/cm. At 6 months after chemotherapy, the average difference in the change in CADS score between the intervention and control groups was -3.2 points, reflecting reduced CIA-related stress in the intervention group. Scalp cooling reduced the incidence of PCIA, primarily by increasing hair thickness compared with control. Scalp cooling is helpful in promoting qualitative hair regrowth. Yet, further research is necessary to observe longer-term benefits of scalp cooling.
