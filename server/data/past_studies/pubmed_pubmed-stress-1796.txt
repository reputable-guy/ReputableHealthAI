Study Title: Evidence about art-based interventions for Indigenous people: a scoping review protocol.

Study Summary:
Indigenous people experience a unique set of health inequalities and social determinants that can negatively affect their physical health, mental health and wellness. This critical state of affairs is compounded by the limited availability of culturally appropriate care services and treatments for the different groups. In response, increasing numbers of studies are turning their focus to art-based interventions and how these might benefit Indigenous lives. The proposed scoping review aims to map this growing field of research. This scoping review is based on the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework and the subsequent enhancements proposed by Levac. Academic databases and grey literature sources will be searched to identify appropriate studies for inclusion. The search strategies of all databases were tested on 25 April 2024. This will be followed by a two-step screening process to be conducted by two researchers and consisting of (1) a title and abstract review and (2) a full-text review. Data from the selected studies will be extracted, collated and charted to summarise all relevant interventions, their outcomes and key findings. An Indigenous research partner will be hired as a consultant, and the research will be further informed by other stakeholders. This study is the first step in a research programme involving working with Indigenous artists to codesign a pilot art-based intervention aimed at improving mental health and wellness among Indigenous people. The scoping review will identify the specific components in documented art-based interventions that have proven beneficial to this group. Since it will draw exclusively on data from published and public sources, no ethics approval is required. The results will be disseminated through knowledge translation activities with Indigenous organisations and art therapy groups; a summary of the results will also be distributed through Indigenous networks.
