Study Title: Examining the cognitive benefits of probiotic supplementation in physically active older adults: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The prevalence of dementia is projected to increase with the growing older adult population and prevention strategies are urgently needed. Two promising interventions include physical activity (PA) and probiotic supplementation, with initial findings suggesting their combined use may confer greater cognitive benefits than either intervention alone. However, no study has yet examined the effects of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function in healthy, physically active older adults. The present study used archival data from a randomized clinical trial including 127&#xa0;physically active, middle-aged to older adults (average age 64.3 years) with self-reported PA levels meeting or exceeding recommendations to investigate the effects of probiotic supplementation (GG; L.GG) on cognitive outcomes. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed no significant changes in cognitive performance from baseline to follow up as an effect of L.GG consumption. These results suggest that probiotic supplementation may not improve cognitive function in persons already engaged in high levels of PA. Future research should include prospective studies to determine whether long-term use of probiotic supplementation may help prevent cognitive decline. Clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov; study # NCT03080818.Initial research shows promising cognitive benefits of combined PA and probiotics consumption. L.GG did not lead to acute cognitive improvements for older adults already meeting PA guidelines. Prospective studies examining prevention of cognitive decline with probiotics in healthy and clinical samples are much needed.
