Study Title: Effect of repeated post-resistance exercise cold or hot water immersion on in-season inflammatory responses in academy rugby players: a randomised controlled cross-over design.

Study Summary:
Uncertainty exists if post-resistance exercise hydrotherapy attenuates chronic inflammatory and hormone responses. The effects of repeated post-resistance exercise water immersion on inflammatory and hormone responses in athletes were investigated. Male, academy Super Rugby players (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18, 19.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5 y, 1.85&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.06&#xa0;m, 98.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.7&#xa0;kg) participated in a 12-week programme divided into 34-week blocks of post-resistance exercise water immersion (either, no immersion control [CON]; cold [CWI]; or hot [HWI] water immersion), utilising a randomised cross-over pre-post design. Fasted, morning blood measures were collected prior to commencement of first intervention block, and every fourth week thereafter. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyse main (treatment, time) and interaction effects. Repeated CWI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) and HWI (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.62) reduced creatine kinase (CK), compared to CON. HWI decreased (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59) interleukin (IL)-1ra, compared to CON. HWI increased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001-0.026, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.06-0.17) growth factors (PDGF-BB, IGF-1), compared to CON and CWI. CWI increased (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46) heat shock protein-72 (HSP-72), compared to HWI. Post-resistance exercise CWI or HWI resulted in trivial and moderate reductions in CK, respectively, which may be partly due to hydrostatic effects of water immersion. Post-resistance exercise HWI moderately decreased IL-1ra, which may be associated with post-resistance exercise skeletal muscle inflammation influencing chronic resistance exercise adaptive responses. Following post-resistance exercise water immersion, CWI increased HSP-72 suggesting a thermoregulatory response indicating improved adaptive inflammatory responses to temperature changes, while HWI increased growth factors (PDGF-BB, IGF-1) indicating different systematic signalling pathway activation. Our data supports the continued use of post-resistance exercise water immersion recovery strategies of any temperature during in-season competition phases for improved inflammatory adaptive responses in athletes.
