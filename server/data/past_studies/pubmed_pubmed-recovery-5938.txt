Study Title: Effects of melatonin on postoperative pain and sensory recovery following zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures - A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Posttraumatic and postsurgical sensory disturbance is a known complication of almost all zygomaticomaxillary (ZMC) complex fractures involving the infraorbital nerve, for which few treatments are effective. Our study used neurosensory assessments to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin on pain and nerve healing following ZMC surgery. Sixty-four randomly allocated ZMC fracture patients were prophylactically administered either oral melatonin or an identical placebo for 15 consecutive days. Pre- and postsurgical clinical parameters included subjective pain, numbness, and objective neurosensory function. Melatonin significantly reduced subjective pain perception in the early postoperative days, with a significant difference in VAS scores between the groups from postoperative day 3 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.048) until day 7 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). The VAS assessment of subjective numbness perception showed significantly lower self-perceived neurosensory disturbance for patients in the interventional group from the first month (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.039) until the third month (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005). Objective neurosensory assessment using the pinprick test and two-point discrimination showed statistically significant improvement to almost normal sensation by the first month (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014) to fully normal sensation by the third month (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). The study findings suggest that the prophylactic administration of melatonin confers significant clinical benefits in terms of reduced postoperative pain and improved sensory recovery.
