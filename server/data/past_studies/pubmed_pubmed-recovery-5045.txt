Study Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial Assessing the Impact of Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation on Gastrointestinal Motility, Nutritional Status, and Immune Function in Patients Following Cerebrovascular Accident Surgery.

Study Summary:
Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation (TEAS) is a technique that involves stimulating specific acupoints on the body with electrical currents. It may regulate nerve excitability and improve nerve function. This study aimed to assess the impact of TEAS on gastrointestinal motility, nutrition, and immune function in patients post cerebrovascular accident surgery in the intensive care unit (ICU). A randomized controlled trial included 300 post-cerebrovascular surgery patients at Lishui Central Hospital (January 2021-June 2023). Patients were randomly assigned to TEAS or control groups in a 1:1 ratio. The TEAS group received TEAS at bilateral Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Tianshu (ST25), Neiguan (PC6), and Hegu (LI4) according to the International Acupuncture Point Code, plus standard care. The control group received routine enteral nutrition and sham TEAS. Nutritional, immune, and gastrointestinal motility indicators were compared. A randomized controlled trial involving 300 post-surgery patients compared TEAS to sham TEAS, demonstrating significant enhancements (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) in immune function and gastrointestinal motility. Compared to the control group, the TEAS group showed significant improvements in the patient's serum nutritional levels (prealbumin, albumin, hemoglobin, and total protein), immune status (IgG, IgA, IgM, and CD4+/CD8+), gastrointestinal motility (daily gastric residual volume, time to achieve target feeding volume, time for nutritional fluid to meet standards, time to first bowel movement, time to first passage of activated charcoal stool, time to reach the defecation volume), and overall condition (the scores of clinical scales and ICU stay duration) (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The TEAS group also experienced a significantly lower incidence of adverse events (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Early TEAS intervention positively impacted recovery, shortened ICU stay, and improved outcomes in patients post cerebrovascular accident surgery.
