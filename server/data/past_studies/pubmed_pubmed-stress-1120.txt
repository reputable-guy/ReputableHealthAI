Study Title: Examining the interplay between mental health indicators and quality of life measures among first-year law students: a cross-sectional study.

Study Summary:
This research explores the intricate relationships between mental health indicators (depression, stress, and anxiety) and various dimensions of quality of life among first-year law students. The study aims to understand how affective valence, mood states, physical activity, body image perception, and social relations influence mental health outcomes. Data were collected from 75 first-year law students (46 females, 29 males), a group predominantly composed of young adults with limited financial means, living in various housing situations, primarily within urban environments, and generally reporting low levels of physical activity. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess mental health and quality of life, including the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21), Feeling Scale (FS), Exercise-Induced Feeling Inventory (EIFI), Modified Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire (MBPAQ), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), and Contour Drawing Rating Scale (CDRS). Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis were employed to analyze the data. The analysis revealed significant correlations between depression (mean = 5.97, SD = 4.21), stress (mean = 7.81, SD = 4.80), and anxiety (mean = 6.17, SD = 4.58) with affective valence (< 0.05), mood states (< 0.05), physical activity (< 0.05), body image perception (< 0.05), and social relations quality (< 0.05). Additionally, mood states (mean = 20.73, SD = 10.60), physical activity (mean = 8.43, SD = 1.35), body image perception (mean = 4.21, SD = 1.91), and social relations quality (mean = 12.46, SD = 2.33) were identified as significant predictors of mental health outcomes (< 0.05). These findings underscore the complex interplay between mental health indicators and various dimensions of quality of life, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive approach to mental health care. By identifying these predictors, we have gained a clearer understanding of the factors that impact mental health in this specific population. The insights gained highlight the value of interventions aimed at improving mood, increasing physical activity, enhancing body image, and strengthening social connections. These targeted strategies could effectively address mental health issues and promote well-being among law students. Future research should further investigate these relationships and develop tailored interventions to better support students' mental health. This study contributes to understanding the complex interplay between mental health and quality of life, offering a foundation for both practical interventions and future research.
