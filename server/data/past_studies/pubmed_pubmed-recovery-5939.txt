Study Title: Plasma-Induced Changes in the Metabolome Following Vistula Tart Cherry Consumption.

Study Summary:
Evidence suggests that tart cherry (TC) supplementation has beneficial effects on health indices and recovery following strenuous exercise. However, little is known about the mechanisms and how TC might modulate the human metabolome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of an acute high- and low-dose of Vistula TC supplementation on the metabolomic profile in humans. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over design, 12 healthy participants (nine male and three female; mean &#xb1; SD age, stature, and mass were 29 &#xb1; 7 years old, 1.75 &#xb1; 0.1 m, and 77.3 &#xb1; 10.5 kg, respectively) visited the laboratory on three separate occasions (high dose; HI, low dose; LO, or placebo), separated by at least seven days. After an overnight fast, a baseline venous blood sample was taken, followed by consumption of a standardised breakfast and dose conditions (HI, LO, or placebo). Subsequent blood draws were taken 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 h post consumption. Following sample preparation, an untargeted metabolomics approach was adopted, and the extracts analysed by LCMS/MS. When all time points were collated, a principal component analysis showed a significant difference between the conditions (< 0.05), such that the placebo trial had homogeneity, and HI showed greater heterogeneity. In a sub-group analysis, cyanidine-3--glucoside (C3G), cyanidine-3--rutinoside (C3R), and vanillic acid (VA) were detected in plasma and showed significant differences (< 0.05) following acute consumption of Vistula TC, compared to the placebo group. These results provide evidence that phenolics are bioavailable in plasma and induce shifts in the metabolome following acute Vistula TC consumption. These data could be used to inform future intervention studies where changes in physiological outcomes could be influenced by metabolomic shifts following acute supplementation.
