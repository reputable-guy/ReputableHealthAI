Study Title: Gastrointestinal Health: A Foundation for Whole-body Wellness.

Study Summary:
The focus on gastrointestinal (GI) health has been increasing due to a growing awareness of its pivotal role in overall well-being. Current trends in addressing GI health aim to optimize gut-microbiome composition, understand the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, and use functional diagnostic testing to aid in diagnosis and guide treatments for GI disorders. The study intended to examine advances in microbiome research, including advancements in technology, and to investigate methods of noninvasive diagnostics, the importance of the gut-brain axis (GBA) and the oral cavity, the types of beneficial microorganisms, and the prevalence of functional GI disorders (FGIDs). The study took place at Biocidin Botanicals in Watsonville CA, USA. Recent research has illuminated the critical role that gut health plays in human physiology and disease. Also, the oral cavity is emerging as a vital microbial reservoir affecting both GI and systemic health. Dietary patterns and lifestyle choices exert profound effects on the gut microbiota and host metabolism, emphasizing the importance of holistic approaches to GI care. FGIDs impose significant burdens on patients' quality of life and the healthcare systems. Integrating stress management strategies and supporting healthy lifestyle choices are essential for managing FGIDs effectively. Functional foods, prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics offer promising avenues for optimizing GI health and mitigating disease risk.
