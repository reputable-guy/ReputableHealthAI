Study Title: Effect of casozepine administration on stress in dogs during a veterinary examination - A randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of the study was to investigate the stress-reducing effect of a casozepine before a veterinary examination in dogs. It should be examined whether the dogs are less stressed during a standardized veterinary examination after an oral application of casozepine over 2 days and whether the administration has an influence on the salivary concentrations of the stress hormones vasopressin and cortisol. Across the study group (n=36), a significantly lower stress score (P=0.0026) and lower mean (P=0.01) and maximum (P=0.024) pulse rates were seen at follow-up after casozepine administration, in contrast to the placebo group (n=26). Salivary vasopressin concentrations increased during follow-up in the placebo group (P=0.04), whereas they remained the same in the casozepine group. Cortisol concentrations increased during follow-up in the casozepin group (P=0.01). The results indicate that although dogs in both groups remained excited at follow-up, short-term casozepine administration before a veterinary visit had a weak stress-reducing effect in dogs based on subjective stress scoring and pulse rate.
