Study Title: A High Protein Diet Is Associated with Improved Glycemic Control Following Exercise among Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes.

Study Summary:
Nutritional strategies are needed to aid people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in managing glycemia following exercise. Secondary analyses were conducted from a randomized trial of an adaptive behavioral intervention to assess the relationship between post-exercise and daily protein (g/kg) intake on glycemia following moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adolescents with T1D. Adolescents (= 112) with T1D, 14.5 (13.8, 15.7) years of age, and 36.6% overweight or obese, provided measures of glycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (percent time above range [TAR, >180 mg/dL], time-in-range [TIR, 70-180 mg/dL], time-below-range [TBR, <70 mg/dL]), self-reported physical activity (previous day physical activity recalls), and 24 h dietary recall data at baseline and 6 months post-intervention. Mixed effects regression models adjusted for design (randomization assignment, study site), demographic, clinical, anthropometric, dietary, physical activity, and timing covariates estimated the association between post-exercise and daily protein intake on TAR, TIR, and TBR from the cessation of MVPA bouts until the following morning. Daily protein intakes of &#x2265;1.2 g/kg/day were associated with 6.9% (= 0.03) greater TIR and -8.0% (= 0.02) less TAR following exercise, however, no association was observed between post-exercise protein intake and post-exercise glycemia. Following current sports nutrition guidelines for daily protein intake may promote improved glycemia following exercise among adolescents with T1D.
