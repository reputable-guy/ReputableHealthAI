Study Title: Are dietary intake and nutritional status of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids correlated with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia? - Exploratory results from ENHANce.

Study Summary:
To explore the relationship between dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) intake, nutritional PUFAs status and sarcopenia outcomes in sarcopenic older adults. The Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) is an ongoing 5-armed triple blinded randomized controlled trial, in sarcopenic older adults (>&#x2009;65y) aiming to assess the effect of combined anabolic interventions (protein, omega-3 supplement and exercise) on physical performance in these adults, compared to single/placebo interventions. Baseline data were used for a secondary, exploratory, cross-sectional analysis. Dietary PUFAs intake was assessed with 4-day food records, status with RBC membrane fatty acids profiles. Spearman's rho(&#x3c1;) correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations of PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, mass and physical performance), physical activity (step count) and quality of life (SF-36, SarQoL). In total, 29 subjects (9&#x2642;/20&#x2640;, mean age 76.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.4y) were included. Total omega-3 intake of participants (1.99&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.99&#xa0;g/d) was below the recommended intake (&#x2642;:2.8-5.6&#xa0;g/d; &#x2640;:2.2-4.4&#xa0;g/d). Intake and status of PUFAs were not correlated. Regarding correlations with outcomes, &#x3b1;-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM) (&#x3c1;:-0.439; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017), whereas docosahexaenoic acid status was positively associated with aLM (&#x3c1;:0.388; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038). Some omega-3 PUFAs intake and status markers were positively associated with step count, SF-36 and SarQoL scores, whereas gamma-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with SF-36 physical component summary score (&#x3c1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.426; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024). Although intake of omega-3 and omega-6 was low, the present exploratory study generated new hypotheses for potential correlations of PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia.
