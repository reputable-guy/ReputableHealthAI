Study Title: Comparing the effect of prolonged exposure therapy (PET) and metacognitive therapy (MCT) on the quality of life among veterans with PTSD.

Study Summary:
Veterans' quality of life (QoL) can be drastically affected by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We compared prolonged exposure therapy (PET) with metacognitive therapy (MCT) in their effects on quality of life (QoL) among veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Overall, 57 veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to three groups MCT (=&#xa0;17), PET (=&#xa0;17), and Control (=&#xa0;23). The 36-item short-form survey (SF-36) was used to evaluate QoL pretest, posttest, and after a 3-month follow-up. The MCT was based on the practice of detached mindfulness, controlling rumination/anxiety, and challenging negative beliefs about symptoms. The PET was based on in-vivo and imaginal exposure to trauma-related events, and discontinuation of avoidance-oriented coping strategies. Both MCT and PET groups significantly improved QoL at posttest and follow-up, compared with the control group (<&#xa0;.001); however, the MCT and PET groups showed no significant difference at posttest (=&#xa0;.644) or follow-up (=&#xa0;.646). Our results support the efficacy of PET as the standard for PTSD treatment, while also signifying the effectiveness of MCT at increasing the QoL in war-related PTSD at a 3-month follow-up.
