Study Title: Effect of cell therapy with adipose-derived stem cells in the treatment of acute rupture of the Achilles tendon in humans.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in the treatment of acute rupture of the Achilles tendon. It was a cross-sectional study involving 15 patients. Patients were randomly divided: group 1-rupture; group 2-suture; group 3-rupture&#x2009;+&#x2009;ADSCs. In the AOFAS score, the score was higher in group 3 with a significant difference. In the ATRS score, the score was higher in groups 2 and 3, also with a significant difference. As for the ultrasound score, there was a significant difference between the experimental groups in relation to this score, however, in the multiple comparisons test, comparing two groups at a time, it was possible to observe a significant difference of the experimental groups. It can be concluded that cell therapy in this condition may be a treatment option due to tissue regeneration and significant recovery of function.
