Study Title: Effects of Kinesiotaping on upper limb function and daily activities in subacute or chronic stroke survivors: A randomized control study.

Study Summary:
Impaired upper limb function in stroke survivors is characterized by muscle weakness, increased muscle tone, contracture, or impaired motor control. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Kinesio-taping application for functional recovery on the affected arm and forearm during rehabilitation. Forty-one patients eligible for this study were randomly assigned to either the Kinesio-taping group (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;21), receiving Kinesio-taping intervention and conventional therapy, or control group (n&#x200a;=&#x200a;20), receiving sham Kinesio-taping intervention and conventional therapy. The whole intervention lasted for 3 weeks. Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity, Barthel Index, the Stroke Impact Scale, and modified Ashworth scale were measured at 3 time points: baseline, post-treatment (3rd week), and follow-up (6th week). In the Kinesio-taping group, there were significant differences in the upper extremity (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.003), wrist (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.000) and hand (p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.000) parts of the Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity between the three assessment times. On the other hand, the Barthel Index showed significant differences in both groups after therapy. Combining conventional rehabilitation with Kinesio-taping intervention may improve functional motor performance of both the proximal and distal parts of the affected upper extremity in stroke survivors, with potential benefits for activity of daily living.
