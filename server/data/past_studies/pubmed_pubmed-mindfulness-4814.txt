Study Title: A randomized controlled trial of a web-based mindfulness programme for people with MS with and without a history of recurrent depression.

Study Summary:
Evidence shows small positive effects associated with psychological treatments for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). In a recent meta-analysis, the treatment with the largest effect size was a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI). We aimed to determine whether an Internet-delivered MBI was beneficial for PwMS. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate history of recurrent depression as a moderator of treatment outcome. Participants (&#x2009;=&#x2009;132) were assessed based on whether they had a history of recurrent depression, then stratified and randomized to MBI or waitlist. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 and 6&#x2009;months. The MBI group reported significantly improved depressive symptoms (primary outcome) compared with the waitlist (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046, Cohen's&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.39). Those with a history of recurrent depression benefitted significantly more than those without (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.66). There were benefits for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the MBI, irrespective of depression history (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5). Pain interference was less overall in the MBI group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001,&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2), but change over time did not differ from waitlist. There were no treatment effects for anxiety, pain severity or fatigue. The Internet-delivered MBI significantly improved depressive symptoms and HRQoL in PwMS. For depression, the benefits were greater for those with a history of recurrent depression.
