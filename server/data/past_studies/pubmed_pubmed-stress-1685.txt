Study Title: Urine metabolomics unravel the effects of short-term dietary interventions on oxidative stress and inflammation: a randomized controlled crossover trial.

Study Summary:
Dietary biomarkers in urine remain elusive when evaluating diet-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. In our previous study, we conducted a randomized controlled crossover trial to compare the short-term (4-weeks) effects of the balanced Korean diet (BKD) with Western diets, including the 2010 dietary guidelines for Americans (2010 DGA) and typical American diet (TAD), on various metabolic indices in obese Korean adults. Building on this work, the current research focuses on the impact of these dietary interventions on oxidative stress (d-ROMs and BAP) and inflammation (CRP, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, IL-1&#x3b2;, MCP-1) biomarkers in serum, and the concurrent urine metabolomes. Each dietary regimen was in silico and experimentally examined for their antioxidant levels using ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays, as well as total flavonoid (TFC) and total phenolic (TPC) contents. We assessed post-intervention variations in oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers in serum, as well as the urine metabolite profiles for the participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;48, average age: 41&#xa0;years). Antioxidant contents and associated total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were significantly higher for the recommended diets (BKD and 2010 DGA) compared to TAD (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Butanol extracts from recommended diets (BKD and 2010 DGA) showed significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to TAD in ABTS (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), DPPH, and FRAP (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) assays. Consistent results were observed in total phenolic and flavonoid contents, mirroring their respective antioxidant activities. Following the intervention period, oxidative stress & inflammation markers in serum varied marginally, however, the urine metabolite profiles were clearly demarcated for the BKD and Western dietary groups (PC1&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.41%). For BKD group, the pre- and post-intervention urine metabolite profiles were clearly segregated (PLS2&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.93%). Compared to TAD, urine extracts from the recommended dietary group showed higher abundance of benzoic acid & phenolic derivatives (VIP&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.7, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Metabolites associated with oxidative stress were observed higher in the urine samples from Western dietary groups compared to BKD. Urine metabolomics data delineated the post-intervention effects of three dietary interventions which corroborates the respective findings for their effects on metabolic indices.
