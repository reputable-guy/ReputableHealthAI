Study Title: Precision nutrition impact on metabolic health and quality of life in aging population after a 3-month intervention: A randomized intervention.

Study Summary:
Innovative precision dietary procedures are required to promote healthy aging. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a personalised strategy based on the inclusion of individualised foods and digital tools on overall health status and quality of life within a follow-up of 3 months in older adults with overweight or obesity. 127 men and women aged between 50 and 80 years with overweight/obesity participated in the study-between January 2020 and September 2020 at the Center for Nutrition Research-University of Navarra and IMDEA-ALIMENTACI&#xd3;N-and were randomly assigned to a usual-care group (standard recommendations) or precision group (precision nutrition strategy based on the inclusion of individualised foods and a mobile application). Anthropometry, body fat percentage, biochemical parameters, diet, and quality of life (SF-36 Health Survey) were assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Both strategies were found to improve overall metabolic health; however, the precision approach demonstrated significantly better outcomes. The precision strategy reduced body weight at 3 months (-4.3&#x2009;kg; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) with significant improvements in body fat percentage, blood pressure and general metabolic health (glycated haemoglobin; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; hepatic steatosis index) in comparison with the standard recommendations. The precision approach significantly enhanced the quality of life (SF-36) of individuals, with additional improvements in emotional well-being (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024) and vitality (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated with a higher quality of life and vitality. These results support the benefit of precision nutrition approaches for promoting healthy aging and emotional well-being, enhancing the quality of life in aging populations, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
