Study Title: Application of enhanced recovery after surgery based on multiphase optimization strategy in the nursing management of children with snoring disease day surgery.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of applying a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to enhance recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols within the nursing management of children undergoing day surgery for snoring disease. While MOST has been applied to behavioral intervention research in smoking cessation, AIDS management, and weight loss by international scholars, its application in constructing nursing intervention projects remains relatively unexplored. Using convenience sampling, randomised controlled trial. A convenience sampling method was employed. The study recruited 200 preschool children diagnosed with snoring who underwent day surgery at a specific hospital between January 2023 and January 2024. The participants were divided into two groups: a control group receiving standard nursing care and an experimental group receiving MOST-guided, integrated high-quality nursing plans specifically designed for children with snoring undergoing day surgery, adhering to established ERAS guidelines. Children in the experimental group exhibited significantly lower anxiety levels compared to the control group, both in the preoperative waiting area and upon returning to the ward (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). While the quality of discharge teaching scale (QDTS) scores did not reveal a statistically significant difference between the groups (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.01), the content of discharge instructions and the perceived effectiveness and skill of nurse guidance differed significantly between the control and experimental groups(p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). Notably, the experimental group experienced a demonstrably lower incidence of thirst, hunger, crying, aspiration, pain, and conversion of day ward to routine hospitalization mode compared to the control group (all p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting between the groups after rehydration (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.01). The implementation of ERAS protocols enhanced by MOST within the nursing management of children with snoring undergoing day surgery demonstrates significant efficacy. This approach can effectively reduce preoperative anxiety in children, improve the quality of discharge guidance provided to parents, and demonstrably decrease the occurrence of postoperative thirst, hunger, crying, aspiration, pain, and the need for unplanned hospitalization transitions within 6&#xa0;h after surgery. It is necessary to provide fast rehabilitation nursing for children with snoring during daytime operation. Nurses should adopt the theory of fast rehabilitation based on multi-stage optimization strategy to promote children's fast rehabilitation after operation.
