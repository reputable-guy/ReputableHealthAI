Study Title: Effect analysis of tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium combined with a-lipoic acid in patients with diabetes peripheral neuropathy.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium combined with &#x3b1;-Lipoic acid on fasting blood sugar (FPG), 2h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), total cholesterol (TG), triacylglycerol (TC) and therapeutic effect in patients with diabetes peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The control group (n=52) was treated with tanshinone IIA sodium sulfonate alone. The study group was treated with &#x3b1;-Lipoic acid and tanshinone IIA sodium sulfonate. The changes in blood glucose, blood lipid levels, oxidative stress indicators and the improvement of nerve function conduction of both two groups were compared. After treatment, study group's FPG, 2hPG, TG and TC were found to be lower than the control group (P<0.05). The levels of Super oxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide (NO) in the study group were higher than those in the control group. The study group had lower Malondialdehyde (MDA) (P<0.05). The study group had higher nerve motor conduction velocity (MNCV) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) (P<0.05). Tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium combined with &#x3b1;-Lipoic acid can improve DPN patients' blood glucose and lipid levels, alleviate the oxidative stress reaction of the body, promote the recovery of nerve conduction function and enhance the therapeutic effect.
