Study Title: Effectiveness of mobilization with movement in patients operated for distal radius fracture: a single-blinded, randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the use of Mulligan's mobilization with movement technique in patients who underwent surgery for distal radius fracture. AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of adding Mulligan's mobilization with movement to the conventional exercise program for those who underwent open reduction and volar plate application due to distal radius fracture. This randomized controlled, single-blind study was conducted with 53 patients who had been operated on for distal radius fracture. The patients were divided into two groups, the mobilization with movement group and the control group. Patients in the mobilization with movement group were mobilized using Mulligan's mobilization with movement technique in addition to the rehabilitation program used in the control group. The degree of volar inclination and radial inclination were recorded. Radial height was measured in millimeters. Ulnar variance was recorded. Perimeter was measured using the Figure of Eight method. The range of motion of the joint was measured by goniometry. Hand grip strength was measured with Jamar&#xae; hand dynamometer, and pinch grip was measured with a pinch meter. The Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation questionnaire was used to assess functionality. There is no statistically significant difference identified between the groups (p>0.05). The intra-group changes in the data of the groups were found to be statistically significant in visual analog scale, range of motion, pinch grip, hand grip, and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation parameters (p<0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the mobilization with movement group and the control group for pronation value and hand grip strength value in measurements (p<0.05). XThe mobilization with movement had no additive effect on parameters other than hand grip strength and pronation.
