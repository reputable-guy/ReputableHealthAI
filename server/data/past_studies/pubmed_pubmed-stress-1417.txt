Study Title: Underlying mechanisms of change in the effects of cognitive behavior therapy on posttraumatic stress disorders among Chinese children: Results from a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Evidence for the effectiveness of group-based trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) has existed, but little is known about how group-based TF-CBT works in the treatment of children with PTSD. The purpose of the present study is to explore the mediators for the reduction of PTSD severity in group-based TF-CBT. We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in China. In this trial, 234 children with PTSD were randomly assigned to the TF-CBT group or the treatment as usual (TAU) group. The primary outcome (reduction in severity of PTSD symptoms) and possible mediators (trauma memory quality, emotion regulation strategies, and resilience) were assessed at baseline and posttreatment. The mediation analysis was performed to investigate the indirect effects of possible mediators on treatment outcomes. The mediation model revealed that changes in trauma memory quality, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, and resilience mediated the relationship between the group (TF-CBT vs. TAU) and PTSD at post-treatment. Adaptive emotion regulation strategies were not a key mechanism underlying PTSD reduction in group-based TF-CBT. Group-based TF-CBT might affect PTSD by reducing risk factors, like trauma memory quality and maladaptive emotion strategies. Group-based TF-CBT also might affect PTSD by increasing protective factors, like resilience. Thus, monitoring these mediators throughout treatment might be an important factor in optimizing treatment outcomes.
