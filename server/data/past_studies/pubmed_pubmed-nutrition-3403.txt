Study Title: Improving nutritional status after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: results of phase 2 ALLONUT clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition increases the risk of non-relapse mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). Here are the results of the ALLONUT clinical trial designed to improve the nutritional outcome of patients receiving aHSCT. ALLONUT is a prospective open label phase 2 clinical trial assessing the efficacy of a close tailored nutritional support and management with traditional and original solutions to improve patients nutritional status following aHSCT. Nutritional status evaluation was performed before transplantation, on Day 0, 30, 100 and one year after transplantation. The study involved 70 patients treated by aHSCT. 10% of patients were moderately or severely malnutrition at baseline and 26.9 were severely malnutrition at D30. Patients' nutritional status improved thanks to the cooking classes and the personalized outpatient nutrition program. At D100, 23% were still malnutrition, while only 10.8% were severely malnutrition one year after transplantation. The QLQ-C30 show that quality of life (QoL) decreased until D30, and improve to reach the pre-transplant level on D100 before exceeding it on D360. The study confirmed that a close, personalized nutritional program combining traditional and original measures can improve both nutritional status and QoL for patients suffering from moderate or severe malnutrition after aHCST.
