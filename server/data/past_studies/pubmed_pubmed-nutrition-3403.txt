Study Title: Quality of life following perioperative optimization with nutritional supplements in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery for cancer: A randomized, placebo-controlled feasibility clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Up to two thirds of patients presenting for abdominal cancer surgery are malnourished pre-operatively. Perioperative nutritional supplementation has been proposed to improve surgical outcomes, though its effect on quality of life (QoL) is not yet understood. A randomized controlled feasibility trial for perioperative nutrition among patients undergoing major abdominal cancer surgery was conducted. Participants in the intervention group received supplements for 30 days before surgery. Participants completed two QoL questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C-30 and FACT-G) at baseline, then 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Participants were compared between and within groups at baseline, Weeks 4,&#xa0;and 12 using t&#xa0;tests. Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) were considered as a 10-point worsening from baseline. Sixty-six&#xa0;participants were available for analysis in this study, including 33 in the intervention and 30 in the control arms. Baseline demographics were balanced between groups except for different rates of pancreas cancer (36% intervention vs. 9% control) and colorectal cancer (19% intervention vs. 34% control). At baseline, participants in the intervention group had lower overall QoL (59% vs. 77%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), role functioning (72% vs 88%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045), and cognitive functioning (79% vs 90%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047). Following surgery, role and physical functioning worsened in the control group, without significant differences between groups. Role functioning was persistently worsened at 12 weeks in the control group. The rates of MCIDs were similar between both intervention and control groups. Perioperative nutrition was associated with preservation of QoL in the postoperative period following major abdominal cancer surgery compared to placebo. Among patients undergoing surgery for cancer, the majority present at high risk for malnutrition. In this placebo-controlled randomized trial among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for cancer, preoperative nutrition supplementation was associated with the preservation of QoL in the postoperative period.
