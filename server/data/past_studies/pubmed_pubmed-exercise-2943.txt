Study Title: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Food Craving in Women Affected by Overweight and Obesity: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Craving is a multifactorial behavior caused by central circuit imbalance. The proposed treatments involve exercise and reduced food intake. However, the treatments frequently fail. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 10 consecutive sessions of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on food craving and eating consumption of women affected by overweight and obesity. A randomized double-blind controlled trial with 50 volunteers was divided into two groups (active-tDCS: n = 25 and sham-tDCS: n = 25). There were a total of 10 consecutive tDCS sessions (2 mA, for 20 min) with an F4 anodal-F3 cathodal montage. We evaluated the effects on eating behavior (food craving, uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, and cognitive restriction), food consumption (calories and macronutrients), and anthropometric and body composition variables (weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat percentage). There were no statistically significant results between groups at the baseline regarding sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Also, there was no significant interaction between time versus group for any of the variables studied. Treatment with tDCS was well tolerated and there were no serious adverse effects. In women affected by overweight and obesity with food cravings, 10 sessions of F4 (anodal) and F3 (cathodal) tDCS did not produce changes in eating behavior, food consumption, and anthropometric and body composition.
