Study Title: Does a broad-spectrum cannabidiol supplement improve performance in a 10-min cycle ergometer performance-test?

Study Summary:
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid which has been proposed to possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Given the potential for perceptions of pain to limit exercise performance, the aim of the present study was to investigate if 3&#xa0;weeks of daily CBD supplementation (150&#xa0;mg&#xa0;day) improved performance in a 10-min performance-trial on a cycle ergometer. In a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, 22 healthy participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11 male and n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11 female) completed two 10-min performance trials on a WattBike cycle ergometer interspersed with a 3-week supplementation period. Supplementation involved either 150&#xa0;mg&#xa0;dayoral CBD or 150&#xa0;mg&#xa0;dayof a visually identical placebo (PLA). During trials, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE [6-20]), heart rate (HR) and blood lactate (BLa) were collected every 2&#xa0;min. Mean power (W) was also taken throughout the exercise at each time point. All data were analyzed using two-way ANOVAs. There were no significant differences (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05) between CBD or PLA groups for mean power (W) during the 10-min performance trial. There were also no significant differences (P&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05) in any of the physiological or perceptual parameters (HR, BLa and RPE) between conditions. Three weeks supplementation of a broad-spectrum CBD supplement did not improve performance via any change in RPE during a 10-min time trial on a cycle ergometer, and as such, this evidence does not support the claim that broad-spectrum CBD supplements could be performance-enhancing in this exercise modality.
