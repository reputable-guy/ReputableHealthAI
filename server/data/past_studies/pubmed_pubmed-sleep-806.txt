Study Title: Effect of hypoglossal nerve stimulation on snoring: an evaluation using objective acoustic parameters.

Study Summary:
Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is an established therapy for sleep apnea syndrome. Whether or not this therapy on snoring and nighttime noise exposure is effective and how strong this effect may be has not been objectively investigated thus far and was the aim of this study. In 15 participants (14 males; age: 30-72&#x2009;years; mean: 51.7&#x2009;years), polysomnography and acoustic measurements were performed before and after hypoglossal nerve stimulation. The therapy led to a significant improvement in sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index from 35.8 events/h to 11.2 events/h,< .001). Acoustic parameters showed a highly significant reduction in the average sound pressure level (42.9 db[A] to 36.4 db[A],< .001), averaged sound energy, A-weighted (LAeq; 33.1 db[A] to 28.7 db[A],< .001), snoring index (1,068 to 506,< .001), percentage snoring time (29.7-14.1%,< .001), and psychoacoustic snore score, the latter being a measure of annoyance due to snoring (47.9 to 24.5,< .001). This study was able to show for the first time by means of objective acoustic and psychoacoustic parameters that hypoglossal nerve stimulation can not only cause a significant improvement in sleep apnea but also has a positive effect on snoring and thus noise annoyance experienced by the bed partner.
