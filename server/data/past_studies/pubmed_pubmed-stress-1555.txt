Study Title: Assessing the efficacy and feasibility of emotional intelligence and stress management training for medical students within their third-year surgery clerkship.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a cognitive fitness training (CFT) program on the development of emotional intelligence and stress management skills in medical students during their 3rd year surgery clerkship. MS3s (n&#xa0;&#x200b;=&#xa0;&#x200b;80) were randomized into a training or control group. The training group received CFT during their clerkship, the control group received online access afterwards. A cognitive fitness (CF) assessment was administered before and after the clerkship. The training group demonstrated a significant improvement in cumulative assessment scores (126.4-146.5, p&#xa0;&#x200b;<&#xa0;&#x200b;0.0001) and most dimensions of CF assessment. Integration of the curriculum did not adversely impact performance on surgery NBME or surgery OSCE when compared to control (p&#xa0;&#x200b;>&#xa0;&#x200b;0.05). The CFT provided to MS3s resulted in significant improvements in CF, including most subcategories. The CFT also did not have an adverse impact on academic performance indicating its feasibility within medical education curricula.
