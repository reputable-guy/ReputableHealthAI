Study Title: Effects and Feasibility of a Memory Exergame Training in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility, sustainability, and effectiveness of task-specific memory exergame training on motor-cognitive performance in older adults.Fifty older adults (age: 78.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.0 years) participated in a randomized controlled trial with a 10-week intervention and 3-month follow-up period. Both the intervention group (IG:&#x2009;=&#x2009;29) and control group (CG:&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) underwent a once-weekly exercise program, including strength and balance exercises, while the IG performed an additional exergame training, combining dynamic balance with visuospatial memory tasks. Outcome measures were completion time for distinct levels of memory exergame tasks without (condition 1) and with procedural support (condition 2) and (sub)-total game scores documented by a game-specific assessment strategy.Significant improvements in the IG compared with the CG over the intervention period were found for completion times in most of the analyzed levels of condition 1 (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001-0.047;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.238-0.335) and one level of condition 2 (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001,&#x2009;0.267), for the subtotal game score of condition 1 (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002;&#x2009;0.186), and for the total game score (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005;&#x2009;0.162). Improvements were partially sustained 3 months after training cessation (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008-0.039,&#x2009;0.095-0.174). Completion rates for initial levels were 86%-98%. No clinical events or safety issues were observed during the training.The study demonstrates that additional memory exergame training effectively, and sustainably, improves performance in complex motor-cognitive tasks involving dynamic balance and visuospatial memory in older adults.
