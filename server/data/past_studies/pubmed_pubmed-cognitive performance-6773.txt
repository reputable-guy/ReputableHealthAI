Study Title: Medium-term effects of a two-desk sit/stand workstation on cognitive performance and workload for healthy people performing sedentary work: a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Implementing sit/stand workstations in sedentary work environments is a common way to reduce sedentary time, but their medium-term effect on cognitive performance is unclear. To address this circumstance, eighteen office workers participated in a two-arm, randomised controlled cross-over trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02825303), either working at a traditional (sit) or an interventional (sit/stand) workplace for 23&#xa0;weeks. Cognitive performance (working speed, reaction time, concentration performance, accuracy), workload and relevant covariates (salivary cortisol level, heart rate, physical activity, sitting time) were measured pre- and post-intervention under laboratory conditions. MANOVA and RMANOVA results did not show differences in performance parameters and workload, respectively, between sit/stand and traditional workplace users. Differences in text editing accuracy and cortisol levels for sit/stand workstation users indicate potential connectivity to cognitive parameters which should be further examined with large-scale studies.Medium-term effects of working at sit/stand workstations on cognitive performance and workload are unexplored. This randomised controlled trial suggests that cognitive performance and workload are unaffected for sit/stand workstation users after 23&#x2009;weeks of use. However, accuracy appeared to improve and physiological stress appeared to be altered.: BMI: body mass index; IPAQ: International physical activity questionnaire; MET: metabolic equivalent of task; MANOVA: multivariate ANOVA; NASA TLX: NASA task load index; RMANOVA: repeated measures ANOVA.
