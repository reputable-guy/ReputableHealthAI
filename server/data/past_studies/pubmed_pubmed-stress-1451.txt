Study Title: The effect of Rebozo technique on perceived labour pain and childbirth experience: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Pain, stress, and anxiety experienced during childbirth can have detrimental effects on labor and delivery. The rebozo technique is an ancestral method used to minimize pain and enhance relief during gestation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the rebozo technique on the birth process and its probable benefits on the birth experience. This survey was conducted from January to May 2021 in a randomized and controlled manner. A total of 113 pregnant women with their first children were surveyed. Women between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation without complications who were admitted to the delivery room with a cervical dilation of 4&#x2009;cm or more were chosen as participants. In the Rebozo group, subjects were randomly selected by trained personnel to apply the standardized method, while the control group received a relaxing massage. Cervical dilation, fetal position, contraction patterns, and measures related to the birth experience were key indicators. Women in the rebozo group had lower pain levels during birth and greater birth satisfaction. Mean cervical dilation in the latent phase was 5.61&#x2009;cm in the rebozo group and 5.71&#x2009;cm in the control group. In the active phase, cervical dilatation was 6.03&#x2009;cm in the rebozo group and 6.68&#x2009;cm in the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001). In the transition phase, the birth time was 46.29 minutes in the rebozo group and 68.71 minutes in the control group (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;<.007**). In the total birth experience score, the rebozo group received an average of 68.52 points, while the control group received 51.58 points (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001). This research has established that the use of the rebozo technique throughout labor helps enhance her feelings about being pregnant, as well as heightening fulfillment with delivery.
