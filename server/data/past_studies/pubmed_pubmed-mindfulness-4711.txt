Study Title: Discourses of Mental Wellness Among Adolescents Living with HIV in Cape Town, South Africa.

Study Summary:
Adolescence is a unique period of development where individuals transition from childhood to adulthood, and where they are at heightened risk for developing mental health problems and engaging in risky behaviours. In addition, adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) must learn to cope with challenges related to the biological impact of a chronic condition, adhering to lifelong treatment, and managing HIV-related psychological and social challenges. Mental wellness as a precursor to mental wellbeing, is vital to facilitate persistent adherence and engagement in care for optimal treatment outcomes for ALHIV. However, little is known about how ALHIV understand and talk about mental wellness in the context being on HIV treatment. We conducted a photovoice study with 12 groups, consisting of 43 ALHIV, aged 15-19 years, and receiving HIV treatment at three public primary health care facilities in the Western Cape Metropole in South Africa. Through discourse analysis, we identified six themes that depicted mental wellness concepts that were prominent in their experiences, namely, connectedness, spirituality and mindfulness, social coherence and awareness, self-esteem, self-acceptance, and sense of coherence. In addition, the adolescents gave accounts of six mental wellness behaviours namely, self-efficacy, coping, resilience, life purpose, engagement in enjoyable life activities and physical functioning. These concepts and behaviours are similar to those identified in targeted interventions aimed at ALHIV. These mental wellness concepts and behaviours are critical to improving health outcomes for ALHIV and should be targeted in the delivery of youth friendly services and integrated HIV care in public healthcare facilities in South Africa and the sub-Saharan African continent.
