Study Title: The impact of single sessions of aerobic exercise at varying intensities on depressive symptoms in college students: evidence from resting-state EEG in the parietal region.

Study Summary:
The incidence of depression among college students is increasingly high, significantly impacting their daily lives. This study aims to utilize electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the effects of varying intensities of single-session aerobic exercise on depression symptoms in college students. This study aimed to explore the effects of single sessions of aerobic exercise at varying intensities on depressive symptoms in college students through changes in BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory-II) scores and resting-state EEG lateralization. Depressed college students were randomly assigned to low, moderate, high-intensity exercise, and control groups. The study investigated the relationship between BDI-II scores and resting-state EEG parietal region lateralization and the impact of single sessions of aerobic exercise at different intensities on depressive symptoms. BDI-II scores were negatively correlated with parietal region &#x3b1;2 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) and &#x3b2;1 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) lateralization in depressed students. Low-intensity exercise significantly reduced BDI-II scores (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Moderate-intensity exercise resulted in significant changes in BDI-II scores (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), &#x3b1;2 lateralization (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and &#x3b2;1 lateralization (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). Post-test comparisons showed significant differences in BDI-II (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048), &#x3b1;2 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and &#x3b2;1 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041) compared to the control group, and differences in &#x3b1;2 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021) and &#x3b2;1 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041) compared to the low-intensity group. High-intensity exercise also significantly altered BDI-II scores (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and &#x3b1;2 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035). Post-test comparisons showed differences in BDI-II compared to low-intensity (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), moderate-intensity (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), and control groups (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and differences in &#x3b1;2 compared to the control group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). BDI-II changes were negatively correlated with changes in &#x3b1;2 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) and &#x3b2;1 (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). From the perspective of the BDI-II, various intensities of a single bout of aerobic exercise can alleviate depressive symptoms in college students. Additionally, regarding the lateralization of resting EEG in the parietal region, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise demonstrates a more comprehensive improvement. The alleviation of depressive symptoms in college students is, to some extent, associated with the synergy within the parietal region. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2400087920, 07/08/2024).
