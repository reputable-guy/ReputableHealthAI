Study Title: A phase 2 pilot study of umbilical cord blood infusion as an adjuvant consolidation therapy in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Study Summary:
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aging-related malignancy, with patients aged &#x2265;60 years old facing significantly poorer prognosis. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has emerged as a promising source with effective anti-aging roles. Here, we conducted a prospective, phase 2, single-arm trial of UCB infusion as an adjuvant consolidation therapy in elderly AML patients (ChiCTR-OPC-15006492). A total of 51 patients were enrolled (median age 66 years; range, 60-75) and received two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy combined with UCB infusion. At a median follow-up of 27.3 months (range, 9.3-100), the median overall survival (OS) was not yet reached and the median event-free survival (EFS) was 72.2 months (range, 5.4-100). The 2-year OS and EFS rates were 76.9% and 62.8%, respectively. No acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) or toxicity-related death occurred in any patient. The median times to platelet and neutrophil recovery were 11.5 days (range, 6-17) and 12.2 days (range, 0-21), respectively. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified enhanced anti-tumor and anti-aging properties of UCB, manifested through activation of immune responses and telomere synthesis/maintenance. These findings suggest that UCB infusion is an effective and safe post-remission adjuvant therapy for elderly AML patients. This study provides evidence that anti-aging therapy may serve as a new and promising dimension in combined cancer treatment.
