Study Title: Effect of Cold Vapor Application on Postoperative Sore Throat, Dry Throat, and Difficulty Swallowing: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Postoperative sore throat, dry throat, and difficulty swallowing are frequently reported complications following general anesthesia, imposing discomfort and challenges to patients during their recovery.The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cold vapor application for 15 minutes at 0, 2, and 6 hours after extubation on sore throat, dry throat, and difficulty swallowing.This was a randomized controlled experimental study. The research was carried out with 64 patients who underwent cholecystectomy in the operating room and general surgery clinic of a state hospital between December 2016 and August 2017. Research data were collected using the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, Mallampati scoring, patient identification form, intraoperative patient evaluation form, Ramsey Sedation Scale, Numerical Rating Scale, dry throat and difficulty swallowing evaluation form, and cuff pressure gauge.It was found that cold vapor application at the 0th, 2nd, and 6th hours postoperatively had no effect on sore throat and swallowing difficulty. Mean dry throat scores of the patients in the intervention group at the second and sixth hours were significantly lower than those in the control group. At the 24th hour, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean scores of sore throat, swallowing difficulty, and dry throat in the intervention and control groups.According to the results of this study, it was found that cold vapor application in the early postoperative period had no effect on sore throat and swallowing difficulty but reduced throat dryness at the second and sixth hours.In the early postoperative period, cold vapor can be applied to relieve hoarseness due to extubation.
