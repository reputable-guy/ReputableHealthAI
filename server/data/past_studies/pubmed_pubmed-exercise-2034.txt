Study Title: L-Arginine Supplementation Did Not Impact the Rapid Recovery of Cardiovascular and Autonomic Function Following Exercise in Physically Active Healthy Males: A Triple-Blind Randomised Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial.

Study Summary:
Post-exercise recovery strategies include massage, low-intensity active exercise, thermal contrast, hydration, and nutritional and herbal approaches. These strategies aim to accelerate recovery, enhance performance, and optimise the physical training process. L-arginine (L-ARG) is the physiological precursor of nitric oxide (NO), a crucial mediator of vasodilation and the inhibition of platelet aggregation. A previous study reported that L-ARG supplementation could significantly reduce the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). This study aimed to investigate the effects of L-ARG on autonomic and cardiovascular recovery immediately following submaximal exercise. Thirty-two healthy individuals were subjected to two experimental protocols. The first protocol included 60 min of rest, a treadmill warm-up, and load increments until reaching 80% of their maximum HR. Before this protocol, the subjects consumed 3 g of starch (placebo protocol). The second protocol was identical, but the subjects consumed 3 g of L-ARG. Heart rate recovery (HRR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure (BP) responses were assessed. No significant differences in HRR were found (= 0.944) regarding the root mean square of successive differences in the RR interval (RMSSD30) of HRV (= 0.562) or in the BP responses (mean arterial pressure (MAP),= 0.687; pulse pressure (PP),= 0.929) between the protocols. L-ARG supplementation did not significantly alter immediate post-exercise autonomic recovery in healthy males.
