Study Title: Indices of exercise induced muscle damage following low load resistance exercise with blood flow restriction in untrained males.

Study Summary:
There is conflicting evidence regarding the presence and magnitude of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) following low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction (LL+BFR), which may be related to the protocol implemented or exercise volume. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of a 75 repetition (BFR-75) (1&#xd7;30, 3&#xd7;15) and four sets to volitional failure (BFR-4x) protocols on indices of EIMD among untrained men. Twelve males with no history of lower-body resistance training during the previous six months volunteered for this investigation. One leg was randomly assigned to BFR-75, and the other to BFR-4x. Participants performed isokinetic, unilateral, concentric-eccentric, leg extension muscle actions at 30% of maximal strength with BFR. Indices of EIMD (limb circumference, perceived muscle soreness, pain pressure threshold [PPT], passive range of motion, and maximal strength [MVIC]) were recorded before exercise and 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96-hours post-exercise for each protocol. There were no significant changes (P>0.05) in limb circumference, PPT, passive range of motion, or MVIC. For both BFR-75 and BFR-4x, perceived muscle soreness increased (P<0.001) similarly 24- (2.5&#xb1;1.7 AU) and 48-hours (1.9&#xb1;1.7 AU) post-exercise. There was an increase in muscle soreness 24-48 hours post-exercise for both conditions, which may be due to metabolic stress, but this did not affect the force-generating capacity of the muscle (MVIC), suggesting minimal EIMD. The conflicting evidence of EIMD following LL+BFR may be related to differences in restriction time or overall exercise time.
