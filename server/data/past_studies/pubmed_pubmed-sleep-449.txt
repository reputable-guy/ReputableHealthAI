Study Title: Evaluation of the "15 Minute Challenge": A Workplace Health and Wellbeing Program.

Study Summary:
The 15 Minute Challenge is an mHealth workplace wellness initiative, employing gamification to promote physical activity, aiming to enhance health outcomes and overall well-being. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness of the program among employees at various Australian, New Zealand, and UK workplaces. Real-world data from 11,575 participants across 73 companies were analyzed. The program encouraged daily 15 min physical activity sessions over six weeks. Participants self-reported their physical activity and fitness, energy, overall health, sleep quality, and mood at baseline and 6 weeks. Program satisfaction, engagement rates, and adherence to the program were also assessed. Effectiveness was evaluated using multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analyses. The intervention showed significant increases in physical activity, with 95% of participants meeting or exceeding international physical activity guidelines, up from 57% at baseline (< 0.05). Self-reported fitness, energy, overall health, sleep quality, and mood significantly improved (between 7.1 and 14.0% improvement; all< 0.05). High satisfaction was reported, with 92% of participants recommending the program. The 15 Minute Challenge effectively increased physical activity levels and improved self-reported health outcomes among participating employees. The high satisfaction rates and significant health improvements highlight the potential of workplace wellness programs to combat sedentary behavior and promote a healthier, more active lifestyle.
