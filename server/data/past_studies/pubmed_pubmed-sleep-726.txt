Study Title: A randomized controlled trial of effects of sleep hygiene training and progressive muscle relaxation training in children with ADHD.

Study Summary:
Sleep problems often accompany ADHD and negatively affect ADHD symptoms, however, there are not enough intervention studies on sleep interventions in children with ADHD. The present study investigated the effects of sleep hygiene training (SH) and progressive muscle relaxation exercises (PMR) in children with ADHD. 57 children aged 6-12 years with ADHD were randomly assigned to the SH and SH&#xa0;+&#xa0;PMR groups and completed the intervention consisting of group training and eight weeks of telephone interviews. The effects of both intervenitons were evaluated via parent, child and clinician report scales and neuropsychological tests. Both interventions resulted in significant positive changes in child sleep, ADHD symptoms, functioning, neuropsychological tests and parental sleep quality. Significant differences were found between the interventions in selective attention, peer problems and anxiety scores in favor of the SH&#xa0;+&#xa0;PMR group. SH may have positive effects on various clinical parameters as well as sleep problems in children with ADHD. Addition of PMR to SH may lead to further improvements in anxiety, peer problems and selective attention. SH and PMR may be a useful tool in the clinical management of children with ADHD with sleep problems.
