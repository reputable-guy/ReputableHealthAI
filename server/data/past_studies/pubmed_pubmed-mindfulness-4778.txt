Study Title: Mindfulness, disordered eating, and impulsivity in relation to glycemia among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and suboptimal glycemia from the Flexible Lifestyles Empowering Change (FLEX) intervention trial.

Study Summary:
To assess the relationship between mindfulness and glycemia among adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with suboptimal glycemia, and evaluate the potential mediation by ingestive behaviors, including disordered eating, and impulsivity. We used linear mixed models for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and linear regression for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to study the relationship of mindfulness [Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM)] and glycemia in adolescents with T1D from the 18-month Flexible Lifestyles Empowering Change (FLEX) trial. We tested for mediation of the mindfulness-glycemia relationship by ingestive behaviors, including disordered eating (Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised), restrained eating, and emotional eating (Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire); and impulsivity (total, attentional, and motor, Barrett Impulsiveness Scale). At baseline, participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;152) had a mean age of 14.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.1&#x2009;years and HbA1c of 9.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.2% [79&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13&#x2009;mmol/mol]. The majority of adolescents were non-Hispanic white (83.6%), 50.7% were female, and 73.0% used insulin pumps. From adjusted mixed models, a 5-point increase in mindfulness scores was associated with a -0.19% (95%CI -0.29, -0.08, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0006) reduction in HbA1c. We did not find statistically significant associations between mindfulness and CGM metrics. Mediation of the relationship between mindfulness and HbA1c by ingestive behaviors and impulsivity was not found to be statistically significant. Among adolescents with T1D and suboptimal glycemia, increased mindfulness was associated with lower HbA1c levels. Future studies may consider mindfulness-based interventions as a component of treatment for improving glycemia among adolescents with T1D, though more data are needed to assess feasibility and efficacy.
