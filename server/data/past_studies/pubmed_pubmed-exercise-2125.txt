Study Title: Comparing the effect of stretching and compression exercises on flexion relaxation ratio of back muscles in patients having deep gluteal syndrome: A randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Different treatments have been proposed for patients with deep gluteal syndrome (DGS). Stretching and compression exercises are commonly used to treat DGS. To compare the effects of compression or stretching exercises on the flexion-relaxation response (electromyography signals of back muscles) in patients with DGS. In this clinical trial with parallel groups, forty-five eligible patients were randomly allocated into three groups; compression exercise (ICE) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15), stretching exercise (ISE) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15) and control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15). All treatment groups (control, ICE and ISE) underwent 10 sessions of physiotherapy treatment at a frequency of three per week. The flexion-relaxation ratio (FRR) for back muscles was investigated as the primary outcome measure. No significant differences were detected in FRR of back muscles at the end of the study between three study groups (all p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). In all groups after interventions, no significant changes in FRR compared to the baseline values were observed (within changes were not significant; all p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). The pairwise comparisons of the between groups revealed that the disability scores in the ISE group compared to ICE, were significantly lower (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.53; df&#xa0;=&#xa0;2; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009). Neither stretching nor compression exercises affected FRR more than the control group in DGS patients. Between-group analyses suggest that ISE only has a more significant effect on improving the disability of patients with the deep gluteal syndrome. The trial was retrospectively registered in the "IRANIAN" Registry of Clinical Trials (www.irct.ir) on January 10, 2017 as IRCT201604178035N4. URL of the record: https://en.irct.ir/trial/8473.
