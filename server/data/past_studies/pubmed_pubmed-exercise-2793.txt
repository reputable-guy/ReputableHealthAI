Study Title: Evaluation of a football fitness implementation initiative for an older adult population in a small-scale island society.

Study Summary:
The proportion of older people increases globally, which calls for sustainable interventions promoting healthy aging. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the potential of Football Fitness as a sustainable model to promote quality of life, mental health, and physical function for older adult. The study was conducted in collaboration with a municipality, a football club, and a university, and was designed as a randomized controlled trial. A total of 66 people (34 women, 32 men) older than 60&#x2009;years were randomly assigned (60/40) to a Football Fitness (FOT) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;38, 20 women, 18 men) and a control group (CON) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;28, 14 women, 14 men). FOT participated in Football Fitness for 12&#x2009;weeks. Quality of life (QoL) and mental wellbeing were determined pre-and post-intervention. Physical loading and Flow experience were measured in one representative training session. Blood pressure (BP), Yo-Yo Intermittent endurance test level 1 (Yo-Yo IE1), sprint performance, postural balance, and body composition were also performed pre-and post-intervention. An improvement in mental wellbeing was observed for both groups from pre- to post-intervention (values <0.001) with no between-group differences. Regarding QoL, the environment domain improved in FOT compared to CON (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Mean Flow (&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.69; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.07) and perceived importance (&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.20; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.42) and average experienced difficulty was&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.23 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.67), perceived skill (&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.23; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.56), and perceived balance (&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.64; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.56). These levels of flow can be characterized as being high. A between-group effect (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) existed for systolic BP, which decreased (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) by -5% [-8; -1%] in CON and remained unchanged in FOT. Both groups improved the Yo-Yo IE1 to a similar extent, with 28% [11; 44%] (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) in FOT and 27% [9; 46%] in CON (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Postural balance improved (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) by 38% [13; 63%] in FOT only, resulting in a superior (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) balance score in FOT compared to CON post-intervention (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Football Fitness improved the environmental quality of life domain and postural balance in older adults. Additionally, it appears to be a feasible group activity for older adults that promotes high flow and physical loading during training.
