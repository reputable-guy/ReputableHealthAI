Study Title: Evolution of fruit and vegetable intake among health promotion service participants in a Brazilian metropolis: 48-month follow-up of a randomized controlled community trial.

Study Summary:
To assess longitudinal effects of a nutrition intervention on fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake among Primary Health Care (PHC) service participants in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Demographics and health data on 3414 PHC service participants were collected at baseline in 2013-2014. F&V intake was assessed at baseline, 12, 36, and 48&#xa0;months until 2017-2018. Services were randomized to control (CG, usual care) or intervention (IG, usual care and a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention to increase F&V intake). We performed difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to identify intervention effects on F&V intake, and sensitivity analyses of participants observed at all timepoints. Participants were mostly middle-aged, low-income women. Mean baseline intakes were 168.7&#xa0;g of fruit, 202.0&#xa0;g of vegetables, and 370.7&#xa0;g of F&V, with lower fruit in the IG (164.1&#xa0;g) than the CG (172.3&#xa0;g). At 12&#xa0;months, the intervention increased fruit intake in the IG and fruit and F&V intake among individuals with low baseline F&V intake. Fruit intake remained higher at 36&#xa0;months in the IG. No effect on vegetable intake was identified. According to sensitivity analyses, effects on fruit intake among the complete sample did not remain significant at 36&#xa0;months, and an effect on fruit intake at 36&#xa0;months was identified among those with adequate baseline F&V intake. Reductions in F&V intake did not remain significant. At 12&#xa0;months, a TTM-based intervention increased fruit intake in the overall sample, and fruit and F&V intake among individuals with low baseline intakes. Repeated interventions may be needed over time. RBR-9h7ckx.
