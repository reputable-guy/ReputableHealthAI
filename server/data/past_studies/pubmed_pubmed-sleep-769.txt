Study Title: Efficiency of mixed and rigid occlusal stabilization splints: Randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Occlusal stabilization splints are the most common treatment for controlling the deleterious effects of sleep bruxism. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-cost, mixed occlusal splint (MOS) compared to that of a rigid splint. A randomized clinical trial was performed on 43 adults of both sexes with possible sleep bruxism and satisfactory dental conditions. They were divided into rigid occlusal splint (ROS) (n = 23) and MOS (n = 20) groups. Masticatory muscle and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain intensity (visual analog scale), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), indentations in the oral mucosa, anxiety, and depression (HADS), number of days of splint use, and splint wear were evaluated. All variables were evaluated at baseline (T0), 6 months (T6), and 12 months (T12) after splint installation (T0), and splint wear was evaluated at T6 and T12. Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, non-parametric Friedman's analysis of variance for paired samples and pairwise multiple comparisons, Pearson's chi-square test, two-proportion z-test, non-parametric McNemar's and Cochran's Q, and Wilcoxon tests were used (p < 0.05). In both groups, there was a decrease in TMJ pain and pain intensity over time and improvements in the quality of life scores. At T6, there was a higher rate of splint wear in the MOS group than in the ROS group (p = 0.023). The MOS showed a higher rate of wear than the rigid splint but had similar results for the other variables. Therefore, the use of a mixed splint appears to be effective in controlling the signs and symptoms of sleep bruxism.
