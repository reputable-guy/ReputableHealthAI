Study Title: The Walking and Lifestyle Coaching (WALC) Program for University Students: A Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of the 3-week Walking and Lifestyle Coaching (WALC) program with university college students to promote health behavior change and reduce chronic disease risk.During the 3-week WALC program, students received weekly peer health and wellness coaching while engaging in a 30-minute walk throughout campus. Each week, physical activity was directly measured using pedometers, and self-report physical activity behavior, steps, and daily reflections were reported using a self-monitoring journal. At baseline and follow-up, students completed biometrics screening, mental health questionnaires, and the Cooper 1.5 mile walk test to evaluate cardiovascular fitness.A total of 35 college students participated in the WALC program. The mean daily steps number of steps during the WALC program was 6315 (= 2073.16). Only 25/35 participants reported steps for the entire WALC program (71.43%). There was not a statistically significant difference in generalized anxiety, perceived stress, depression, quality of life, or self-compassion. There was a slight decline in body fat percentage, although not statistically significant. There was an average improvement of 89 seconds on the 1.5-mile walk/run test.The WALC program was developed to be inclusive, feasible, and a mechanism to synergize campus resources to collaborate on behalf of student wellness. It is necessary for this program to be utilized on university campuses in diverse geographical regions (i.e., rural, urban, or suburban), with diverse students (i.e., racially, ethnically, gender-identity, and religious affiliation.), and with universities of all sizes and funding levels. Future research could consider the use of a control group as well as an online self-monitoring journal.
