Study Title: Promising Support Coming from Nature: Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Potential ofWood Distillate on Skin Cells.

Study Summary:
Tissue homeostasis, function recovery, and protection mechanisms are boosted by the balanced and timely control of inflammation and oxidative stress. Nowadays, many natural products and bio-derivates exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, supporting medical care and tissue wellness against inflammation, oxidative stress, and inflammaging.wood distillate (WD) is a bio-derivative used as a corroborant and biofertilizer in agriculture. Based on the safety profile of low concentrations of WD on human cells, the present study aims to assess the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of WD on different cell types in the integumentary system. Human keratinocytes, mucosal epithelium, dermal fibroblasts, and endothelial cells were exposed to WD, and the concentrations devoid of pro-apoptotic potential were profiled. Then, the effect of nontoxic doses of WD revealed an anti-inflammatory effect, observed through the immunodetection of prostanoid cascade markers in experimentally induced inflammation. A reduction in endothelial hyperpermeability was evidenced by the immunofluorescence analysis of cell-cell adhesion proteins, VE-cadherin and ZO-1. In addition, WD buffered the exogenously produced oxidative stress. On the whole, WD showed both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities on the various cell types, preserving endothelial barrier integrity. Overall, this study supports the involvement of this bio-derivative in novel exploitable fields, such as therapeutic dermatological applications for human and animal medical care.
