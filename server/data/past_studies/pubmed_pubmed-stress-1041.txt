Study Title: Effects of one-to-one music therapy in older adults with cognitive impairment: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the effects of music therapy (MT), a nonpharmacological therapy, on cognitive, behavioral, and physiological outcomes in older adults with mild-to-moderate cognitive decline residing in care home settings. A randomized controlled trial design was employed, with 42 care home residents (Mage = 86.25 years) randomly assigned to either a one-to-one 16-week MT intervention or an active control group receiving storytelling. Experimental and control activities were matched on key aspects, and groups were equivalent at baseline concerning demographic factors, general health, cognitive-behavioral characteristics, and cognitive reserve levels. Pre/postintervention neuropsychological and behavioral measures were collected, alongside saliva samples for cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratio and respiratory sinus arrhythmia analysis as indicators of overall stress and autonomic regulation. The MT group exhibited benefits in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological domains, suggesting potential advantages in maintaining cognitive functioning and reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms. Biomarkers indicated possible mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of MT. The 16 one-to-one interactive MT sessions-delivered over 5 months-had a positive impact on older adults with mild-to-moderate cognitive decline living in care home settings. The implications of these findings for healthy aging and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).
