Study Title: Leveraging Mindfulness to Reduce Stress and Improve Quality of Life Among Pharmacy Students.

Study Summary:
Methods to improve stress and well-being for health profession trainees are limited. Mindfulness, elevating awareness to the present moment experience with compassion, has been shown to demonstrate effectiveness to enhance well-being. This research leverages techniques from mindfulness to develop and evaluate a credit-bearing longitudinal mindfulness elective, designed to teach mindfulness to improve stress and quality of life (QoL). A mindfulness elective was created for pharmacy students. A longitudinal, case-control, survey-based design was used to compare stress and QoL between mindfulness participants and nonparticipant controls. Stress was assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and QoL by the SF-12 v2 Health-Related QoL Scale (SF-12 v2 QoL). Four weeks after course completion, the average PSS score was lower among participants compared to controls (18.58 SD 5.85 vs 20.79 SD 6.31, Cohen's d = 0.36). The Mental Health Component score of SF-12 v2 QoL was higher among participants versus controls (41.94 SD 8.58 vs 36.93 SD 9.59, Cohen's d = 0.55). The Physical Health Component score of SF-12 v2 QoL was lower among participants than the control group (46.13 SD 5.48 vs 48.62 SD 6.53, Cohen's d = 0.41). The results indicate small to moderate effect sizes associated with participation in a mindfulness elective, reducing stress and improving mental QoL among pharmacy students. The structure and potential benefits of the course can be extrapolated to other institutions. By offering course credit for mindfulness practice, health profession schools can support student wellness.
