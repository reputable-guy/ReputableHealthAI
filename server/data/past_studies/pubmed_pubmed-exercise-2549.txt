Study Title: Effects of alteplase and aspirin on functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke and mild non-disabling neurological deficit.

Study Summary:
Investigate the effect of Alteplase and Aspirin on the functional outcomes of patients with acute ischemic stroke with mild non-disabling neurological deficit. In this single-center, randomized controlled study, we selected 60 patients with acute ischemic stroke with mild non-disabling neurological deficit admitted to our hospital from January 2021 to January 2022, and randomly divided them into the study group (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;30) and the control group (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;30), the control group was given the Aspirin treatment, the study group was given the Alteplase treatment, and the changes in neurological recovery, daily living ability, exercise ability, balance ability, cognitive function, and short-term prognosis outcomes were observed in these 2 groups. The factors influencing the short-term outcome of Alteplase therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke were analyzed. The National Institutes of Health Neurological Deficit Score (NIHSS) scores at T1 and T2 of the study group were lower than those in the control group, but the scores of Barthel indicators (BI), Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment Scale (FMA), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) of the study group were higher than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). The short-term prognostic outcomes of these 2 groups were not significantly different (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). The effect of the use of Alteplase or Aspirin on short-term functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke and mild non-disabling neurological deficit is not much different.
