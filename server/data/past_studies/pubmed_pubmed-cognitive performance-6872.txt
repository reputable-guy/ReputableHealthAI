Study Title: Effect of Dynamic Light Application on Cognitive Performance and Well-being of Intensive Care Nurses.

Study Summary:
Exposure to bright light has alerting effects. In nurses, alertness may be decreased because of shift work and high work pressure, potentially reducing work performance and increasing the risk for medical errors. To determine whether high-intensity dynamic light improves cognitive performance, self-reported depressive signs and symptoms, fatigue, alertness, and well-being in intensive care unit nurses. In a single-center crossover study in an intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in the Netherlands, 10 registered nurses were randomly divided into 2 groups. Each group worked alternately for 3 to 4 days in patients' rooms with dynamic light and 3 to 4 days in control lighting settings. High-intensity dynamic light was administered through ceiling-mounted fluorescent tubes that delivered bluish white light up to 1700 lux during the daytime, versus 300 lux in control settings. Cognitive performance, self-reported depressive signs and symptoms, fatigue, and well-being before and after each period were assessed by using validated cognitive tests and questionnaires. Cognitive performance, self-reported depressive signs and symptoms, and fatigue did not differ significantly between the 2 light settings. Scores of subjective well-being were significantly lower after a period of working in dynamic light. Daytime lighting conditions did not affect intensive care unit nurses' cognitive performance, perceived depressive signs and symptoms, or fatigue. Perceived quality of life, predominantly in the psychological and environmental domains, was lower for nurses working in dynamic light.
