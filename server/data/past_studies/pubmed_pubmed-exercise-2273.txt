Study Title: Does antenatal exercise shape labor and delivery outcomes?

Study Summary:
Incorporating regular physical activity into the lifestyle of a pregnant woman offers numerous health benefits and prepares her effectively for labor. This study was conducted to determine the impact of antenatal exercise on labor, delivery and perinatal outcome. An interventional study was conducted including 200 women attending the antenatal clinic of Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of PGIMS Rohtak, India. The study subjects were randomly divided into two groups-exercise group and control group. The demographic profile of both the groups was similar. A higher proportion of patients in control group required labor induction compared to exercise group (33% vs 16%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). The rate of vaginal delivery was significantly higher in exercise group than in control group (71% vs 56%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027). Additionally, women in exercise group had fewer assisted vaginal deliveries than control group (7% vs 20%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Rates of cesarean section were comparable between both groups (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.736). The mean duration of labor was significantly shorter in exercise group compared to control group (428.69&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;131.242&#xa0;min vs 516.91&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;143.105&#xa0;min, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001). Mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score for pain was 6.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.94 in exercise group compared to 7.89&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.49 in control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001). No significant difference was observed between the groups in birth weight and APGAR score of neonates. A structured exercise program, practiced regularly during the antenatal period reduced the need for labor induction, shortened labor duration, increased the incidence of vaginal deliveries, and decreased pain perception during labor and delivery.
