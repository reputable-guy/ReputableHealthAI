Study Title: A Single Injection of Platelet-rich Plasma Injection for the Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence in Females: A Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
To determine the efficacy of a single injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the anterior vaginal wall at the mid-urethra compared to placebo, as there is emerging evidence that PRP may help treat female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). This was a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a single institution. Females with bothersome, demonstrable stress-predominant urinary incontinence were enrolled. Participants were randomized to either injection of 5&#xa0;mL autologous PRP or saline at the anterior vaginal wall at the mid-urethra. The primary outcome was composite treatment success at 6 months, defined as a negative cough stress test and an answer of "much better" or "very much better" on the Patient's Global Impression of Improvement. Fifty patients were enrolled in the study and randomized to the PRP group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25) or the saline placebo group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25). There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome between the 2 groups. Adverse events were minor, and the rate of adverse events was similar between both groups. In this randomized placebo-controlled study, we were unable to demonstrate a difference in SUI treatment success between PRP and saline injections. At this time, there is insufficient evidence to offer a one-time PRP injection into the anterior vaginal wall for treatment of female SUI.
