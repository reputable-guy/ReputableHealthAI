Study Title: Smartphone mindfulness meditation training reduces Pro-inflammatory gene expression in stressed adults: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness meditation training has been shown to be an effective stress reduction strategy, but less is known about its immunoregulatory impact. In a randomized controlled trial of stressed customer service workers, the present study tested whether a 30-day smartphone-based mindfulness meditation training program (compared to a problem-solving control program) would affect pro-inflammatory gene expression. Both interventions led to reductions in stress levels, but there was no difference in stress reduction between conditions. Consistent with predictions, mindfulness training reduced activity of the pro-inflammatory NF-&#x3ba;B transcription control pathway compared to the active control. These results suggest that mindfulness training may be a particularly effective method for improving immune cell gene expression in stressful work environments.
