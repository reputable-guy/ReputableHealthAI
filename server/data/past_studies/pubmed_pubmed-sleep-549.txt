Study Title: Therapeutic sleep deprivation for major depressive disorder: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is treated primarily using antidepressant drugs, but clinical effects may be delayed for weeks to months. This study investigated the efficacy of brief therapeutic sleep deprivation (TSD) for inducing rapid improvements in MDD symptoms. From November 2020 to February 2023, 54 inpatients with MDD were randomly allocated to TSD and Control groups. The TSD group (23 cases) remained awake for 36&#xa0;h, while the Control group (31 cases) maintained regular sleep patterns. All participants continued regular drug therapy. Mood was assessed using the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) at baseline and post-intervention in both groups. In the TSD group, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was utilized to evaluate subjective mood during and after the intervention. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and post-intervention using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Objective sleep parameters were recorded in the TSD group by polysomnography. The follow-up period spanned one week. HAMD-24 scores did not differ between groups at baseline or post-intervention. However, the clinical response rate was 34.8&#xa0;% higher in the TSD group on day 3 post-intervention compared to the Control group (3.2&#xa0;%), but not sustained by day 7. Moreover, responders demonstrated a faster improvement in the VAS score during TSD than non-responders (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.047). There were no significant differences in MoCA scores or objective sleep parameters between the groups. Small sample size and notable attrition rate. Therapeutic sleep deprivation can rapidly improve MDD symptoms without influencing sleep parameters or cognitive functions. Assessment of longer-term effects and identification of factors predictive of TSD response are warranted.
