Study Title: Unsupervised robot-assisted rehabilitation after stroke: feasibility, effect on therapy dose, and user experience.

Study Summary:
Unsupervised robot-assisted rehabilitation is a promising approach to increase the dose of therapy after stroke, which may help promote sensorimotor recovery without requiring significant additional resources and manpower. However, the unsupervised use of robotic technologies is not yet a standard, as rehabilitation robots often show low usability or are considered unsafe to be used by patients independently. In this paper we explore the feasibility of unsupervised therapy with an upper limb rehabilitation robot in a clinical setting, evaluate the effect on the overall therapy dose, and assess user experience during unsupervised use of the robot and its usability. Subacute stroke patients underwent a four-week protocol composed of daily 45&#xa0;min-sessions of robot-assisted therapy. The first week consisted of supervised therapy, where a therapist explained how to interact with the device. The second week was minimally supervised, i.e., the therapist was present but intervened only if needed. After this phase, if participants learnt how to use the device, they proceeded to two weeks of fully unsupervised training. Feasibility, dose of robot-assisted therapy achieved during unsupervised use, user experience, and usability of the device were evaluated. Questionnaires to evaluate usability and user experience were performed after the minimally supervised week and at the end of the study, to evaluate the impact of therapists' absence. Unsupervised robot-assisted therapy was found to be feasible, as 12 out of the 13 recruited participants could progress to unsupervised training. During the two weeks of unsupervised therapy participants on average performed an additional 360&#xa0;min of robot-assisted rehabilitation. Participants were satisfied with the device usability (mean System Usability Scale scores&#x2009;>&#x2009;79), and no adverse events or device deficiencies occurred. We demonstrated that unsupervised robot-assisted therapy in a clinical setting with an actuated device for the upper limb was feasible and can lead to a meaningful increase in therapy dose. These results support the application of unsupervised robot-assisted therapy as a complement to usual care in clinical settings and pave the way to its application in home settings.
