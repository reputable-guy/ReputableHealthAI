Study Title: Effectiveness of a two-component nutritional strategy for blood pressure control in individuals with hypertension users of a public health system: a randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness of a nutritional strategy based on two components and adapted for the public health system on blood pressure, cardiometabolic features, self-care, qualify of life and diet quality in individuals with hypertension. NUPRESS was an open-label, parallel-group, superiority randomized controlled clinical trial in which participants at least 21&#x200a;years with hypertension and poorly controlled blood pressure were randomly assigned (1&#x200a;:&#x200a;1 allocation ratio) to either an individualized dietary prescription according to nutritional guidelines (control group, n &#x200a;=&#x200a;205); or a two-component nutrition strategy, including a goal-directed nutritional counseling and mindfulness techniques (NUPRESS [intervention] group, n &#x200a;=&#x200a;205). Primary outcomes were SBP (mmHg) after 24 weeks of follow up and blood pressure control, defined as either having SBP more than 140&#x200a;mmHg at baseline and achieving 140&#x200a;mmHg or less after follow-up or having SBP 140&#x200a;mmHg or less at baseline and reducing the frequency of antihypertensive drugs in use after follow-up. In total, 410 participants were randomized and submitted to an intention-to-treat analysis regarding primary outcomes. Both groups decreased blood pressure, but after adjusting for baseline values, there was no significant difference between them on SBP [intervention-control difference: -0.03 (-3.01; 2.94); P &#x200a;=&#x200a;0.98] nor blood pressure control [odds ratio 1.27 (0.82; 1.97); P &#x200a;=&#x200a;0.28]. No differences between groups were also detected regarding secondary and tertiary outcomes. There was no difference between a two-component nutritional strategy and an established dietary intervention on blood pressure in participants with hypertension.
