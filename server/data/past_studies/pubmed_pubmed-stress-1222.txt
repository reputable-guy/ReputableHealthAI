Study Title: [On the effectiveness of a new advisory service for parents of children in need of care: a controlled study].

Study Summary:
On the effectiveness of a new advisory service for parents of children in need of care: a controlled studyFamilies with children in need of care are exposed to great stress. This results in risks that often lead to a poor living and care situation for families. To support them, an innovative regionally anchored support service is being developed by so-called Family Health Partners (FGP) as part of the NEST research project.The primary endpoint of the study is the quality of life of the families. Secondary outcomes are resilience factors and associated measures as well as access to care services.The effectiveness of the FGP will be tested in a controlled study with four measurement times (baseline, after 6, 12 and 18 months) between January 2022 and April 2024. A total of 204 families with children in need of care were recruited for an intervention and control group. Multilevel models are used to analyze the longitudinal data.Between T0 and T1 there are statistically significant improvements in the intervention group, especially in daily and social stress in the family, in mental health and resilience. In addition, knowledge about general benefit rights as well as specific support and relief offers for caring parents has increased.The results of the first two measurement times indicate that a positive change in quality of life, resilience and health literacy can be achieved through the FGP.
