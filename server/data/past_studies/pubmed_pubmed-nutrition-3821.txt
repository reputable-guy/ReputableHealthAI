Study Title: Combined exercise and nutrition intervention for older women with spinal sarcopenia: an open-label single-arm trial.

Study Summary:
Spinal sarcopenia is a multifactorial disorder associated with atrophy and fatty changes in paraspinal muscles. Interventional studies for spinal sarcopenia are limited. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined exercise and nutrition intervention for the treatment of spinal sarcopenia. 35 community-dwelling older women diagnosed with spinal sarcopenia in a previous cohort study were included. The 12-week combined intervention consisted of back extensor strengthening exercises and protein supplementation. The following outcomes were measured at baseline (week 0), after the intervention (week 12), and follow-up (week 24): conventional variables of sarcopenia (appendicular skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, 6-meter gait speed, and short physical performance battery); lumbar extensor muscle mass; lumbar extensor muscle volume and signal intensity; back extensor isokinetic strength; and back performance scale. We used the intention-to-treat analysis method, and repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. Of the total 35 potential participants, 26 older women participated in the study (mean age 72.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.0 years old). After 12 weeks of combined exercise and nutrition intervention, there were no changes in the appendicular skeletal muscle mass, lumbar extensor muscle mass, volume, or signal intensity. Handgrip strength and back extensor isokinetic strength did not change significantly. Short physical performance battery significantly increased (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) from 11.46&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.86 to 11.77&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.53 at week 12 and 11.82&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.40 at week 24. The back performance scale sum score also significantly improved (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034) from 2.68&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.81 to 1.95&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.21 at week 12 and 2.09&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.34 at week 24. The combined exercise and nutrition intervention for community-dwelling older women with spinal sarcopenia could be feasible and helpful in improving the physical performance as well as back performance.
