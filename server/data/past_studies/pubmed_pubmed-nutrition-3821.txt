Study Title: Descriptive Analysis of Mental and Physical Wellness in Collegiate Dancers.

Study Summary:
Understanding the physical and mental health of collegiate dancers is important for developing appropriate screening protocols and treatment interventions. This study aims to provide descriptive data on the overall health, injury burden, and well-being of a group of collegiate dancers, including the interactions between injury, nutrition, and mental health, to provide insight for wellness screening and interventions in collegiate dance programs. Members of the School of Dance at the University of Utah were sent an electronic general health survey. The survey included questions regarding medical history, family history, injuries, diet, sleep quality, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and history of eating disorders. Of the 231 dancers who received the survey, 198 responded (response rate&#x2009;=&#x2009;85.7%). Fifty 2% of respondents had an active injury. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were common (35.4%), and 37.4% of the dancers were interested in receiving mental health support. Symptoms of depression and anxiety had a significant association with both a history of injury and active injuries (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.033 and .039, respectively). History of eating disorder was also significantly associated with active injuries (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.005). The most commonly injured body area was ankle or foot (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;144, 72.7%), followed by lower leg or shin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;76, 38.4%), and knee (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;61, 30.8%). Over a quarter of the dancers (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;54, 27.3%) reported having trouble sleeping, and 9.1% reported having a history of eating disorder. This study highlights the important interplay between mental health, sleep, nutrition, and injury. These results show that in a group of collegiate dancers, active injuries and mental health concerns are common, and that there are statistically significant associations between injury, nutrition, and mental health. These data provide insight into factors that affect dancer wellness and help inform future screening and intervention protocols for dance programs.
