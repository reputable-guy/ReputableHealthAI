Study Title: Daratumumab in pediatric relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma: the DELPHINUS study.

Study Summary:
Patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) have poor outcomes compared with newly diagnosed, treatment-na&#xef;ve patients. The phase 2, open-label DELPHINUS study evaluated daratumumab (16 mg/kg IV) plus backbone chemotherapy in children with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7) after &#x2265;2 relapses, and children and young adults with T-cell ALL (children, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;24; young adults, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;5) or LL (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) after first relapse. The primary end point was complete response (CR) in the B-cell ALL (end of cycle 2) and T-cell ALL (end of cycle 1) cohorts, after which patients could proceed off study to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Seven patients with advanced B-cell ALL received daratumumab with no CRs achieved; this cohort was closed because of futility. For the childhood T-cell ALL, young adult T-cell ALL, and T-cell LL cohorts, the CR (end of cycle 1) rates were 41.7%, 60.0%, and 30.0%, respectively; overall response rates (any time point) were 83.3% (CR&#xa0;+ CR with incomplete count recovery [CRi]), 80.0% (CR&#xa0;+ CRi), and 50.0% (CR&#xa0;+ partial response), respectively; minimal residual disease negativity (<0.01%) rates were 45.8%, 20.0%, and 50.0%, respectively; observed 24-month event-free survival rates were 36.1%, 20.0%, and 20.0%, respectively; observed 24-month overall survival rates were 41.3%, 25.0%, and 20.0%, respectively; and allogeneic HSCT rates were 75.0%, 60.0%, and 30.0%, respectively. No new safety concerns with daratumumab were observed. In conclusion, daratumumab was safely combined with backbone chemotherapy in children and young adults with T-cell ALL/LL and contributed to successful bridging to HSCT. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03384654.
