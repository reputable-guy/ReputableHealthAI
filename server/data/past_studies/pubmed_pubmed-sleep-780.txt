Study Title: Improved Sleep Correlates with Improved Quality of Life and Motor Symptoms with Foslevodopa/Foscarbidopa.

Study Summary:
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa is a subcutaneous infusion of levodopa/carbidopa prodrugs. Assess correlations between sleep and efficacy from interim data of a phase 3 trial of foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (NCT03781167). Pearson correlations between sleep (Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 [PDSS-2]) and quality of life (QoL; Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39), motor experiences of daily living (m-EDL; Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Scale Part II), and "Off"/"On" times were calculated for baseline and week 26 improvements. Regression analyses were adjusted for baseline PDSS-2 score. Baseline sleep correlated moderately with QoL (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.44, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and weakly with m-EDL (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.28; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Sleep improvement weakly correlated with improved "Off" time (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.37; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and QoL (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Regression analyses demonstrated significant positive associations for improved sleep, "Off" time, QoL, and m-EDL. Improved sleep with foslevodopa/foscarbidopa was associated with improved QoL and "Off" time.
