Study Title: Psychological well-being modulates neural synchrony during naturalistic fMRI.

Study Summary:
Psychological well-being (PWB) is a combination of feeling good and functioning efficiently, and has a significant relationship with physical and mental health. Previous research has shown that PWB is associated with improvements in selective attention, mindfulness, semantic self-images, and adaptive decision making, however, it is unclear how these differences manifest in the brain. Naturalistic stimuli better encapsulate everyday experiences and can elicit more "true-to-life" neural responses. The current study seeks to identify how differing levels of PWB modulate neural synchrony in response to an audiovisual film. With consideration of the inherent variability of the literature, we aim to ascertain the validity of the regions previously associated with PWB. We identified that higher levels of PWB were associated with heightened stimulus driven neural synchrony in the bilateral superior parietal lobule, right planum temporale, and left superior temporal gyrus, and that lower levels of PWB were associated with heightened neural synchrony in the bilateral lateral occipital cortex and precuneus. Taken together, this research suggests that there is an association between differing levels of PWB and differential neural synchrony during movie-watching. PWB may therefore have an effect on complex, multimodal processing.
