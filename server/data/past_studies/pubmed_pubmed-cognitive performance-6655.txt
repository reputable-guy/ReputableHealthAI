Study Title: Effects of working memory training on EEG, cognitive performance, and self-report indices potentially relevant for social anxiety.

Study Summary:
Social anxiety (SA) is quite common and associated with multiple comorbidities. Here, we examined the effects of working memory (WM) training on various indices potentially related to SA. Pre-selected university students with elevated self-reported SA symptoms were assigned to a WM training (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) or an active control treatment condition (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). Pre- and post-treatment assessments were made using questionnaires related to (social) anxiety and depression, and tasks measuring WM, interference control, and attentional biases towards, and event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by, angry faces. The training enhanced WM transfer task performance, reduced SA symptoms, and changed the amplitude of the P1, N170, P2, and N2 ERP components. However, the latter changes did not mediate the effect of WM training on SA symptoms. These data provide preliminary evidence of the usefulness of WM trainings to reduce potential indices of SA, but further research is necessary to unravel the causal relation among these indices.
