Study Title: Prospective study on the effects of mechanical bowel preparation under the enhanced recovery after surgery concept on electrolyte disturbances and functional recovery after robotic surgery for urologic tumors in older adults.

Study Summary:
Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) involves the cleansing of bowel excreta and secretions using methods such as preoperative oral laxatives, retrograde enemas, and dietary adjustments. When combined with oral antibiotics, preoperative MBP can effectively lower the risk of anastomotic leakage, minimize the occurrence of postoperative infections, and reduce the likelihood of other complications. To study the effects of MBP under the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) concept on postoperative electrolyte disorders and functional recovery in older people with urological tumors undergoing robot-assisted surgery. Older people with urological tumors undergoing robot-assisted surgery were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;76) underwent preoperative MBP, while the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;72) did not. The differences in electrolyte levels and functional recovery between the two groups after radical surgery for urological tumors were observed. The incidence of postoperative electrolyte disorders was significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group, with incidence rates of 42.1% and 19.4%, respectively (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that the electrolyte disorder was age-related (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of postoperative complications, gastrointestinal function recovery, laboratory indicators of infection, body temperature, and length of hospital stay (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Under the accelerated recovery background, preoperative MBP increases the risk of postoperative electrolyte disorders in older people with urological tumors and does not reduce the incidence of postoperative complications or promote postoperative functional recovery.
