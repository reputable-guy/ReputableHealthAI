Study Title: Teaching medical students ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of synthetic cysts: effect of a formalin-embalmed cadaver simulation model.

Study Summary:
Standard training for ultrasound-guided cyst needle aspiration is currently performed on live patients during residency. This practice presents risk of iatrogenic injury to patients and provides a high-stress learning environment for medical trainees. Simulation training using synthetic cysts in a formalin-embalmed cadaver model may allow for realistic, practical, and effective training free from patient risk. Thirty first-year medical students viewed an orientation video, then attended a skills workshop to perform cyst needle aspiration in formalin-embalmed cadaver tissue under ultrasound guidance. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three ultrasound-trained instructor-types which included a medical student, clinical anatomist, or an ultrasound fellowship trained emergency medicine physician. After training, participants underwent a 5-min skills test to assess their ability to drain a synthetic cyst independently. Pre- and post-training self-confidence surveys were administered. Ultrasound images of synthetic cysts in formalin-embalmed tissue were clear and realistic in appearance, and sonographic needle visualization was excellent. Participants took an average of 161.5&#xa0;s and 1.9 attempts to complete the procedure. Two of the 30 participants could not complete the procedure within the time limit. Participants' self-reported confidence with respect to all aspects of the procedure significantly increased post-training. Mean confidence scores rose from 1.2 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.39) to 4.4 (95% CI 4.09 to 4.53) (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001) Procedure time, number of attempts, performance scores, and self-confidence outcomes were not significantly affected by instructor type. The use of synthetic cysts in formalin-embalmed cadaveric tissue is feasible, realistic, and efficacious for the teaching of ultrasound-guided needle aspiration to novice medical trainees. This simulation training method can be delivered effectively by multiple instructor types and may allow medical trainees to increase their tactical skill and self-confidence prior to performing ultrasound-guided cyst needle aspiration on live patients.
