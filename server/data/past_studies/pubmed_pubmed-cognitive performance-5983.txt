Study Title: A comprehensive study on impact of noise exposure on roadside school childrens' cognitive performance.

Study Summary:
An uncontrolled vehicular population escalates distraction and affects mental wellness due to ambient noise, profoundly affecting the academic landscape. This study investigates the significant influence of ambient noise on schoolchildren's learning, attention, and cognition, underscoring the critical challenges and potential limitations it poses to their academic progress. Cognitive assessments were conducted under prevailing noise and controlled conditions. Noise levels (L, L, L) were measured using a sound level metre (Kimo dB300) in classrooms of ten roadside schools. Findings reveal that noise levels exceed WHO thresholds for classroom environments. Statistical analyses (-test, paired-test, ANOVA, regression analysis) indicate significant differences in noise levels and cognitive test scores between both noise exposure conditions. Schools S8 and S10 showed a remarkable 15% improvement in cognitive test scores when transitioning from noisy to silent conditions. Noise disproportionately affected students aged 11-13, particularly boys. Effective noise control measures were suggested to create conducive learning environments.
