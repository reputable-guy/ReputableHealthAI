Study Title: Burnout and Stress in Forensic Science Jobs: A Systematic Review.

Study Summary:
Burnout and occupational stress are significant issues among forensic professionals, impacting their well-being and job performance. This systematic review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the occupational stress and burnout experienced by forensic personnel, exploring the profound and multifaceted impact on their physical, mental, professional, and interpersonal well-being. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines using Scopus and WOS databases to search for articles published from 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2024. The search used keywords related to burnout and forensic professions. Inclusion criteria were original articles in English and French, while reviews, book chapters, editorials, and notes were excluded. A total of 10 studies were included after eliminating duplicates and excluding irrelevant articles. The review identified seven key findings. (1) High levels of occupational stress and burnout among forensic personnel necessitate effective stress management strategies and resilience training; (2) autopsy technicians in Romania experience burnout and alexithymia, particularly related to traumatic events involving children, highlighting the need for specialized support systems; (3) disparities in burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were observed in autopsy technicians and resident doctors, suggesting tailored mental health resources; (4) organizational factors, such as peer support and compensation satisfaction, significantly impact burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) among sexual assault nurse examiners; (5) burnout among forensic physicians, both in Romania and Egypt, is linked to personality traits, job satisfaction, and socio-demographic factors; (6) pathologists face a range of health issues, including musculoskeletal problems and psychological disorders, underscoring the need for industry-specific health measures; and (7) the lack of wellness resources for forensic professionals calls for improved mental health support and training. The findings highlight the pervasive issue of burnout and stress among forensic professionals globally. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive stress management programs, tailored mental health resources, and organizational support. Future research should focus on developing and implementing effective interventions to enhance resilience and job satisfaction within this high-stress field.
