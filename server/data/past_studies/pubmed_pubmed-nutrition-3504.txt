Study Title: Measuring diet by metabolomics: a 14-d controlled feeding study of weighed food intake.

Study Summary:
Metabolomics has the potential to enhance dietary assessment by revealing objective measures of many aspects of human food intake. Although metabolomics studies indicate that hundreds of metabolites are associated with dietary intake, correlations have been modest (e.g., r < 0.50), and few have been evaluated in controlled feeding studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between metabolites and weighed food and beverage intake in a controlled feeding study of habitual diet. Healthy postmenopausal females from the Women's Health Initiative (N = 153) were provided with a customized 2-wk controlled diet designed to emulate their usual diet. Metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in end-of-study 24-h urine and fasting serum samples (1293 urine metabolites; 1113 serum metabolites). We calculated partial Pearson correlations between these metabolites and intake of 65 food groups, beverages, and supplements during the feeding study. The threshold for significance was Bonferroni-adjusted to account for multiple testing (5.94 &#xd7; 10for urine metabolites; 6.91 &#xd7; 10for serum metabolites). Significant diet-metabolite correlations were identified for 23 distinct foods, beverages, and supplements (171 distinct metabolites). Among foods, strong metabolite correlations (r &#x2265; 0.60) were evident for citrus (highest r = 0.80), dairy (r = 0.65), and broccoli (r = 0.63). Among beverages and supplements, strong correlations were evident for coffee (r = 0.86), alcohol (r = 0.69), multivitamins (r = 0.69), and vitamin E supplements (r = 0.65). Moderate correlations (r = 0.50-0.60) were also observed for avocado, fish, garlic, grains, onion, poultry, and black tea. Correlations were specific; each metabolite correlated with one food, beverage, or supplement, except for metabolites correlated with juice or multivitamins. Metabolite levels had moderate to strong correlations with weighed intake of habitually consumed foods, beverages, and supplements. These findings exceed in magnitude those previously observed in population studies and exemplify the strong potential of metabolomics to contribute to nutrition research. The Women's Health Initiative is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611.
