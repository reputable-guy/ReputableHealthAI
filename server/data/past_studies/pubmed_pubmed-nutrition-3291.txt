Study Title: Unlocking the Potential: Millets and Their Impact on Diabetes Management.

Study Summary:
Many studies, including case studies, meta-analyses, and randomized trials, have demonstrated the benefits of a low-carb diet in the management of obesity, diabetes, and pre-diabetes. Numerous studies suggest that diets low in carbohydrates are safe and can greatly enhance the management of both forms of diabetes as well as the general health of those who have the disease. When used in conjunction with effective therapy, this diet can result in weight loss, decreased prescription dosages, and in certain cases, remission from type 2 diabetes. Globally, there has been a notable surge in the prevalence of diabetes cases as a result of factors such as population growth, aging, urbanization, rising obesity rates, and declining physical activity. Diabetes can be controlled in large part by diet, and millets having&#xa0;low-glycemic index (GI) have become more significant as they release glucose into the bloodstream at a very slow rate. Creating a low-glycemic meal mix with locally sourced ingredients is crucial for daily diet plans. Dietary changes, particularly the addition of millet, can help prevent and manage diabetes mellitus. Eating practices have long been acknowledged for their important role in promoting health and wellness through the consumption of nutrient-dense meals. The health benefits of millet, an underappreciated food crop, are numerous and include low GI, high-fiber content, non-acid-forming potential, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and gluten-free status. Apart from staple crops like wheat and rice, millets are also very healthy and useful, and they have an immense amount of opportunity to aid in the global fight against food insecurity, which is a problem that many countries now confront. Millets are high on the list of recommended foods because of their many health advantages and antioxidant characteristics. Diets that are low in carbohydrates, low in GI, Mediterranean, and very low in calories are now popular. Diabetes can be managed with a nutritious diet, regular exercise, cessation of smoking, and maintenance of a healthy body weight. Furthermore, calorie restriction, the use of low-GI meals, and an increase in fiber content are all possible nutritional strategies in the management of diabetes.
