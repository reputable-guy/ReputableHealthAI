Study Title: Post-Lunch Napping as a Strategy to Enhance Physiological Performance and Cognitive Function in Elite Volleyball Players.

Study Summary:
: Volleyball demands high levels of anaerobic strength, flexibility, agility, and mental focus. Adequate sleep has been shown to enhance athletic performance and cognitive function. This study investigates the impact of post-lunch naps of varying durations (25 and 45 min) on the physiological performance and cognitive focus of elite volleyball players.: Sixteen elite volleyball players (8 male, 8 female) with at least 7 years of competitive experience participated in a randomized crossover study. They underwent three experimental conditions: no nap (No-Nap), a 25-min nap (N25), and a 45-min nap (N45). Physical performance was measured through counter-movement jumps (CMJ) and volleyball agility tests, while cognitive function was assessed using the D2 attention test. Statistical analysis included repeated measures ANOVA to examine the differences between nap conditions and gender-specific responses.: Significant improvements in both physical performance and cognitive focus were observed in the N25 and N45 conditions compared to the No-Nap condition (indicating the effectiveness of short naps in enhancing both physical and mental performance). Males outperformed females in most physical metrics, while females scored higher on the D2 attention test (suggesting possible gender-specific responses to napping). The 25-min nap showed slightly better results in terms of sleep quality and subsequent performance (confirming that shorter naps may be more beneficial).: Post-lunch naps, especially of 25 or 45 min, enhance both physiological and cognitive performance in elite volleyball players. These findings suggest that integrating short naps into athletes' training regimens can improve performance and focus, with potential gender-specific benefits. Further research is needed to explore long-term effects and variations across other sports.
