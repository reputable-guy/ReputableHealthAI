Study Title: Effects of cervicothoracic mobility programme on pain, range of motion and function in patients with chronic back pain.

Study Summary:
To determine the effects of the cervicothoracic mobility programme on pain, range of motion and function in patients with chronic back pain. The randomised controlled trial was conducted from April to November 2022 at the Physiotherapy Department of Syed Medical Complex, Sialkot, Pakistan, and comprised patients of either gender aged 18-50 years who had a minimum of 6 months of chronic back pain with moderate disability. They were randomly allocated to experimental group A and control group B. Group A subjects received cervical and thoracic mobilisation with conventional physical therapy, while group B subjects received conventional physical therapy alone. The treatment duration was 45 minutes per session, with 3 sessions per week for 3 weeks. Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Oswestry Disability Index and a goniometer was used to assess pain, disability and for the range of motion. Data was analysed using SPSS 25. Of the 44 patients, 22(50%) were in each of the 2 groups. Group A had 14(63.6%) females and 8(36.4%) males with overall mean age 36.45&#xb1;10.80 years, while group B had 16(72.7%) females and 6(27.3%) males with overall mean age 35.77&#xb1;11.05 years. There was a significant inter-group difference in terms of pain, function and flexion (p<0.05), while the difference was not significant in terms of extension, right and left lateral rotation (p>0.05). Intragroup analysis showed significant improvement in both groups (p<0.05). Cervicothoracic mobilisation was more effective in improving pain, functionality and range of motion in patients with chronic low back pain. NCT05347251.
