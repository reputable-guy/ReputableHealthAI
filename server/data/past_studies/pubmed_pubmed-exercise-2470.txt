Study Title: The Impact of Different Telerehabilitation Methods on Peripheral Muscle Strength and Aerobic Capacity in COPD Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Lung diseases have profound effects on the aging population. We aimed to hypothesize and investigate the effect of remote pulmonary telerehabilitation and motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO) methods on the clinical status of elderly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to pulmonary telerehabilitation (PtR) or cognitive telerehabilitation (CtR) groups. The programs were carried out 3 days a week for 8 weeks. The 6-min walk test (6MWT), modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score, blood lactate level (BLL), measurement of peripheral muscle strength (PMS), and electromyography activation levels of accessory respiratory muscles were the main outcomes. There was a statistically significant improvement (< 0.05) in both groups in the 6MWT distance and in secondary results, except for BLL. Generally, in the mean muscle activity obtained from the electromyography measurement after the program, there were statistically significant increases in the PtR group and decreases in the CtR group (< 0.05). There was a statistically significant increase in PMS in both groups. An active muscle-strengthening program has the same benefits as applying the muscle-strengthening program to the patient as MI and AO. CtR can be a powerful alternative rehabilitation method in respiratory patients who cannot tolerate active exercise programs.
