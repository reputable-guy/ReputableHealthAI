Study Title: Impact of Topical 0.05% Cyclosporine A Eye Drops on Post-Femtosecond-Assisted Laser In Situ Keratomileusis Ocular Surface Recovery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate the effect of topical 0.05% cyclosporine A (CsA) eye drops as an adjunct to conventional therapy in maintaining post-femtosecond-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) ocular surface stability. Sixty-six patients (eyes) undergoing FS-LASIK were randomized into 2 groups: 33 patients (eyes) in group I (conventional treatment group) and 33 patients (eyes) in group II (CsA group). Conventional treatments include topical levofloxacin, fluorometholone, and artificial tears. Group II received topical 0.05% CsA eye drops twice daily for three months in addition to conventional treatment. Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), numerical rating scale (NRS), tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer I test (SIt), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), conjunctival lissamine green (LG) staining, corneal sensitivity, and corneal nerve morphology were measured. In addition, tear inflammatory cytokine levels were measured using the Luminex assay. Follow-up was performed preoperatively and 1 and 3 months postoperatively. In the CsA group, OSDI, TBUT, LG, corneal sensitivity, and corneal nerve fiber total branch density recovered better than in the conventional treatment group. As for tear inflammatory cytokines, interferon (INF) -&#x3b3;, interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the conventional treatment group as compared with the CsA group. In addition, no significant differences in NRS, SIt, and CFS scores were observed between the two groups. In conclusion, 0.05% CsA eye drops is a useful adjunct to conventional treatment for restoring the ocular surface stability after corneal refractive surgery and is more potent in sustaining anti-inflammatory effects.
