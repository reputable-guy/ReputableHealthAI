Study Title: Plasma beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate availability after enteral administration during critical illness after trauma: An exploratory study.

Study Summary:
During critical illness skeletal muscle wasting occurs rapidly. Although beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a potential treatment to attenuate this process, the plasma appearance and muscle concentration is uncertain. This was an exploratory study nested within a blinded, parallel group, randomized clinical trial in which critically ill patients after trauma received enteral HMB (3&#x2009;g daily) or placebo. Plasma samples were collected at 0, 60, and 180&#x2009;min after study supplement administration on day 1. Needle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were collected (baseline and day 7 of the HMB treatment intervention period). An external standard curve was used to calculate HMB concentrations in plasma and muscle. Data were available for 16 participants (male n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12 (75%), median [interquartile range] age 50 [29-58] years) who received placebo and 18 participants (male n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14 (78%), age 49 [34-55] years) who received HMB. Plasma HMB concentrations were similar at baseline but increased after HMB (T&#x2009;=&#x2009;60&#x2009;min: placebo 0.60 [0.44-1.31] &#x2009;&#xb5;M; intervention 51.65 [22.76-64.72] &#x2009;&#xb5;M). Paired muscle biopsies were collected from 11 participants (placebo n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7, HMB n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4). Muscle HMB concentrations were similar at baseline between groups (2.35 [2.17-2.95]; 2.07 [1.78-2.31]&#x2009;&#xb5;M). For participants in the intervention group who had the repeat biopsy within 4&#x2009;h of HMB administration, concentrations were greater (7.2 and 12.3&#x2009;&#xb5;M) than those who had the repeat biopsy >4&#x2009;h after HMB (2.7 and 2.1&#x2009;&#xb5;M). In this exploratory study, enteral HMB administration increased plasma HMB availability. The small sample size limits interpretation of the muscle HMB findings.
