Study Title: The Impact of Low-Volume High-Intensity Interval Training (LV-HIIT) on Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

Study Summary:
Prevention and reduction of liver fat accumulation and maintenance of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) have been proposed as important therapeutic goals in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to determine the effect of Low-Volume High-Intensity Interval Training (LV-HIIT) on fatty liver index (FLI) and GFR estimation in patients with T2DM. This randomized controlled trial included 80 patients with T2DM and a sedentary lifestyle, randomly divided into HIIT (n=40) and a control group (n=40). Patients with a history of T2DM for at least one year and HbA1C levels between 6.4% and 10% were selected. The intervention group underwent a 4-week LV-HIIT course, comprising 3 sessions per week, while the control group did not receive any intervention. FLI, eGFR, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory variables were assessed in all participants before and after the intervention. FLI (62.0 at baseline, 53.0 at follow-up) significantly decreased in the LV-HIIT group after the intervention, while eGFR (71.0 at baseline, 73.6 at follow-up) significantly increased (P<0.001). However, the control group showed a significant reduction only in Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) (P<0.05). After the intervention, the LV-HIIT group had significantly lower FBS (129.0 at baseline, 121.0 at follow-up), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (24.0 at baseline, 18.0 at follow-up), and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) (22.0 at baseline, 19.0 at follow-up), as well as higher eGFR, compared to the control group (P<0.05). LV-HIIT exercise appears to be a promising and effective training method for improving FLI and eGFR in patients diagnosed with T2DM.
