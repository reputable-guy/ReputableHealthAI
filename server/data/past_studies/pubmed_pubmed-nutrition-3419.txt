Study Title: Short-term reduction of dietary gluten improves metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease: A randomised, controlled proof-of-concept study.

Study Summary:
The current management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) relies on lifestyle intervention. Prior studies have shown that nutritional wheat amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATI) activate toll-like receptor 4 on intestinal myeloid cells to enhance intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammation, including the promotion of murine MASLD, insulin resistance and liver fibrosis. We aimed to assess the impact of ATI (gluten)-free diet in liver as well as metabolic parameters of biopsy-proven MASLD patients. We performed a 6-week, proof-of-concept 1:1 randomised controlled trial of an ATI-free diet. The controls followed a balanced diet recommended by the German Nutrition Society. We assessed changes in controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), body mass index (BMI) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed by the CLDQ-NASH questionnaire. Forty-five patients were consecutively enrolled (21 in the intervention arm and 24 in the control arm). Three patients from each arm discontinued the study. In the ATI-free diet group, a significant decrease in BMI (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), CAP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018) and HOMA-IR (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) was observed at 6&#x2009;weeks. The mean difference in CAP between the two arms at week 6 was 30.5&#x2009;dB/m (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039), with a delta significantly higher in the ATI-free diet group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043). Only an ATI-free diet could achieve a significant improvement in CLDQ-NASH domains (p value for total scoring: 0.013). A short-term ATI-free diet leads to significant improvements in liver and metabolic parameters, as well as patient-reported outcomes with good tolerability. A larger follow-up study is justified to corroborate these findings. NCT04066400.
