Study Title: The effects of dry needling and face yoga on pain, depression, function, and sleep quality in patients with temporomandibular dysfunction.

Study Summary:
Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) poses significant challenges due to its diverse symptoms and impact on patients' daily lives. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of two innovative interventions, dry needling and face yoga, in managing TMD-related issues such as pain, depression, and sleep quality. Ninety patients with TMD symptoms were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into three groups: dry needling, face yoga, and a control group. Various assessments, including Visual Analog Scale for pain, Beck Depression Inventory for depression, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality, were conducted before and 6 weeks after the interventions. A decrease in pain levels and a statistically significant increase in jaw joint movements (mouth opening, protrusive movement, lateral movements) were observed in the dry needling and face yoga groups after treatment (p <0.05). Additionally, improvements in sleep quality were observed (p <0.05). Dry needling and face yoga interventions demonstrated efficacy in managing TMD symptoms, including pain relief and improved jaw movement. The findings suggest that these interventions can be valuable additions to the treatment regimen for patients suffering from TMD-related issues. However, further research is warranted to explore the long-term effects and mechanisms underlying these interventions in TMD management.
