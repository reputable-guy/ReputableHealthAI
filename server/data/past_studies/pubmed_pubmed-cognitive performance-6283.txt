Study Title: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with worse cognitive outcomes in acute moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury: A TBI Model Systems study.

Study Summary:
To examine the relationship between polysomnography-classified obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity and cognitive performance in acute moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis leveraging data from a clinical trial (NCT03033901) and TBI Model Systems. Sixty participants (mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;50&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;18y, 72% male, 67% white) with moderate-to-severe TBI from five civilian rehabilitation hospitals were assessed at one-month post-injury. Participants underwent Level 1 polysomnography. OSA severity was classified as mild, moderate, and severe using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). Associations between OSA metrics of hypoxemia (nadir and total time spent below 90%) and AHI with cognition were examined. Cognition was assessed with the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT), which is comprised of six subtests assessing verbal memory, attention/working memory, processing speed, language, and executive function. Over three-quarters of this acute TBI sample (76.7%) were diagnosed with OSA (no OSA n&#xa0;=&#xa0;14; mild OSA n&#xa0;=&#xa0;19; moderate/severe OSA n&#xa0;=&#xa0;27). After adjustment for age, gender, and education, those with OSA had worse processing speed, working memory, and executive functioning compared to those without OSA. Compared to those with moderate/severe OSA, those with mild OSA had worse working memory and executive function. OSA is highly prevalent during acute stages of TBI recovery, and even in mild cases is related to poorer cognitive performance, particularly in the domains of attention/working memory and executive functioning. Our results support the incorporation of OSA diagnostic tools and interventions into routine clinical care in rehabilitation settings.
