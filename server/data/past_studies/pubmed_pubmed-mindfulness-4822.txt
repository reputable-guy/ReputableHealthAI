Study Title: The effectiveness of workplace health promotion program in reducing work-related depression, anxiety and stress among manufacturing workers in Malaysia: mixed-model intervention.

Study Summary:
The implications of work-related stress among manufacturing workers were often unrecognised. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the workplace health promotion (WHP) program in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress levels, as well as improving the overall quality of life among Malaysian manufacturing workers. The study used a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design and included 88 employees from a food and beverage manufacturing factory in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The intervention group received a comprehensive WHP program based on organisational and individual stress management programs that included (i) healthy mental health module, (ii) anxiety management technique, (iii) mindfulness for stress and (iv) stress at work. The module was delivered through the Occupational Stress Management Course and Employee Assistance Program. The control group received no further intervention other than a general brochure on stress. The study period consisted of an intervention period of 3&#xa0;months followed by a post-intervention period of 3&#xa0;months. Measurements were recorded at baseline and at 3&#xa0;month post-intervention. Outcome measures included the self-perceived depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21), participant's quality of life (WHOQOL), coping skills (COPE-28) and job characteristics (JCQ). The intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in self-perceived stress, anxiety, and depression scores three months post intervention (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001). All domains of health-related quality of life and coping skills related to social support and problem-solving were significantly improved in the intervention group following the intervention (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). In the control group, no significant changes were observed in all the parameters. WHP program shows promising results in improving mental health status, quality of life and coping skills among the manufacturing workers.
