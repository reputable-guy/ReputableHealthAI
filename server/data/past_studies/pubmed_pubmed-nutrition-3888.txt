Study Title: Feasibility of an Individualized mHealth Nutrition (iNutrition) Intervention for Post-Discharged Gastric Cancer Patients Following Gastrectomy: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: A major challenge for post-discharged gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy is the impact of the anatomy change on decreased oral intake, nutritional status, and, ultimately, quality of life. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and preliminary effects of an individualized mHealth nutrition (iNutrition) intervention in post-discharged gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy. (2) Methods: A mixed-method feasibility study with a parallel randomized controlled design was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to either the iNutrition intervention group (= 12) or the control group (= 12). Participants completed measures at baseline (T0), four (T1), and twelve weeks (T2) post-randomization. (3) Results: Recruitment (33%) and retention (87.5%) rates along with high adherence and acceptability supported the feasibility of the iNutrition intervention for post-discharged gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy, echoed by the qualitative findings. The iNutrition intervention significantly improved participants' nutritional behavior (= 0.005), energy intake (= 0.038), compliance with energy requirements (= 0.006), and compliance with protein requirements (= 0.008). (4) Conclusions: The iNutrition intervention is feasible and potentially benefits post-discharged gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy. A larger trial is required to establish the efficacy of this approach. Trial Registration: 19 October 2022 Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2200064807.
