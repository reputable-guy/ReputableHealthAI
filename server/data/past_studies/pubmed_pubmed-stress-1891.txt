Study Title: Eccentric muscle-damaging exercise in the heat lowers cellular stress prior to and immediately following future exertional heat&#xa0;exposure.

Study Summary:
Muscle-damaging exercise (e.g., downhill running [DHR]) or heat exposure bouts potentially reduce physiological and/or cellular stress during future exertional heat exposure; however, the true extent of their combined preconditioning effects is unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of muscle-damaging exercise in the heat on reducing physiological and cellular stress during future exertional heat exposure. Ten healthy males (mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;Standard Definition; age, 23&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3&#xa0;years; body mass, 78.7&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;11.5&#xa0;kg; height, 176.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.7&#xa0;cm) completed this study. Participants were randomly assigned into two preconditioning groups: (a) DHR in the heat (ambient temperature [T], 35&#xa0;&#xb0;C; relative humidity [RH], 40%)&#xa0;and (b) DHR in thermoneutral (T, 20&#xa0;&#xb0;C; RH, 20%). Seven days following DHR, participants performed a 45-min&#xa0;flat run in the heat (Flat[T, 35&#xa0;&#xb0;C; RH, 40%]). During exercise, heart rate and rectal temperature (T) were recorded at baseline and every 5-min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated to assess heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) concentration between conditions at baseline, immediately post-DHR, and immediately pre-Flatand post-Flat. Mean Tduring Flatbetween hot (38.23&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.38&#xa0;&#xb0;C) and thermoneutral DHR (38.26&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.38&#xa0;&#xb0;C) was not significantly different (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.68), with no mean heart rate differences during Flatbetween hot (172&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;15&#xa0;beats&#xa0;min) and thermoneutral conditions (174&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8&#xa0;beats&#xa0;min; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.58). Hsp72 concentration change from baseline to immediately pre-Flatwas significantly lower in hot (-51.4%) compared to thermoneutral (+24.2%; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025) DHR, with Hsp72 change from baseline to immediately post-Flatalso lower in hot (-52.6%) compared to thermoneutral conditions (+26.3%; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.047). A bout of muscle-damaging exercise in the heat reduces cellular stress levels prior to and immediately following future exertional heat exposure.
