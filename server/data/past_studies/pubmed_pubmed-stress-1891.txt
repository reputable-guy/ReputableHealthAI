Study Title: Oral beta-hydroxybutyrate alleviates COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome: A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lung complication of COVID-19 that requires intensive care and ventilation. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body that can modulate metabolism and inflammation in immune cells and lung tissues. We hypothesized that oral BHB could alleviate COVID-19 related ARDS by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. We randomized 75 patients with mild (as per Berlin criteria) ARDS symptoms to receive oral 25&#xa0;g twice daily or placebo for five days. The primary outcome was the change in pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-1&#x3b2;, Interleukin-6, interleukin-18, tumour necrosis factor-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-10) from baseline to day 5. The secondary outcomes were the change in BHB levels from baseline to day 5, the number of hospitalization days, and the occurrence of adverse events. Treatment with formulated BHB resulted in a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines; Interleukin-1&#x3b2; (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0204), Interleukin-6 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0309), interleukin-18 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0116), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0489) and increase in interleukin-10 (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0246) compared treatment with placebo. Importantly, higher BHB levels (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0001) were observed after supplementation; additionally, patients who underwent this approach were hospitalized for fewer days. No serious adverse events were reported. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, an oral adjunct therapy, has shown promising results in ameliorating symptoms of ARDS. This includes reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and decreased patient fatigue levels. Further study with a large sample size is warranted to assess the potential of BHB therapy's effectiveness in reducing the development of severe illness. (http://ctri.nic.in/CTRI/2021/03/031790).
