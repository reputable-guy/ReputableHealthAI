Study Title: Acting with awareness moderates the association between lifetime exposure to interpersonal traumatic events and craving via trauma symptoms: a moderated indirect effects model.

Study Summary:
History of exposure to traumatic events (ETE) is common among women in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and is related to craving. We examined whether ETE (i.e., emotional, physical, sexual abuse) in childhood, adulthood, or both is related to craving via trauma symptoms and how trait mindfulness might attenuate this association. Baseline data from a larger randomized clinical trial of a mindfulness-based intervention for women (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;245) in SUD treatment were used. Inclusion criteria were: 18-65&#xa0;years of age, SUD diagnosis, English fluency, no cognitive impairment, and willingness to be audio recorded and provide consent. Demographics and validated measures of ETE, posttraumatic stress symptoms, trait mindfulness, and substance use craving were collected via in-person interviews. Descriptive statistics, correlational analysis, and relative direct, indirect, and conditional indirect effects models were run. Most participants identified as Hispanic (58.5%), had at least a high school education (52.2%), with a mean age of 32.2. Women reported ETE in childhood only (20.4%), adulthood only (17.5%), both childhood and adulthood (50.0%), and never (11.4%). Compared to women with ETE in both childhood and adulthood, those with exposure in adulthood only (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.10, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.20, -.02) or no exposure (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.11, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.23, -.03; [&#x2206;R.347, F(8, 245)&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.7, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) had lower craving via lower trauma symptomatology but no difference when compared to those with ETE only in childhood. Acting with awareness moderated this indirect effect (&#x2206;R&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04, F(3, 245)&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.66, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004. At low levels of awareness, women with ETE during both childhood and adulthood reported higher craving via trauma symptomatology than women with no exposure or only adulthood exposure. Low levels of acting with awareness may worsen trauma symptoms after ETE, which in turn may lead to more craving for women in substance use treatment. Despite a small moderating effect size, acting with awareness may have clinical significance due to the prevalence of trauma symptoms among women in SUD treatment.
