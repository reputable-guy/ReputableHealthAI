Study Title: Virtual Reality (VR) Device with Integrated Biofeedback Sensors (ReViSide) to Cope with Emotional Burnout State Among Employees Experiencing Stress at Workplace: Problem Overview and Action Plan.

Study Summary:
In this study we examine the issue of employee burnout, caused by long-term exposure to workplace stressors, considering its complex phenomenology in the context of contemporary psychological and psychiatric views. Towards the development of innovative technologies to correct burnout in the context of psychosocial rehabilitation, we present our study protocol involving the ReViSide virtual reality (VR) and biofeedback intervention, including monitoring of respiratory rates and EEG rhythms. The randomized controlled trial protocol includes adult participants aged 18 to 65 years (n=140) who exhibit emotional burnout in the workplace. The intervention group will undergo a course of VR correction (ReViSide), while the control group receives a standard psychocorrection. The primary endpoint will be level of emotional burnout to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). We shall also assess anxiety, depression, asthenia and subjective improvement in condition using validated scales (HADS, HARS, HDRS, VAS-A, PGI-C). We shall test our hypothesis that the VR-correction group will show significant improvements in MBI scores, particularly in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment, compared to the control group. Secondary outcome measures are likewise expected to demonstrate more prominent improvements in the VR group, correlating with the magnitude of burnout reduction to MBI. Analysis of EEG data may reveal changes in alpha rhythm patterns during VR sessions, potentially correlating with reduced distress levels. We designed this study to test the integration of an interdisciplinary approach for treating burnout, highlighting the ReViSide technology. Confirming the efficacy of this approach for psychosocial rehabilitation targeting burnout states among employees should improve their stress resilience, daily motivation, and work productivity in the context of the modern high working pressure environment and demanding corporate culture.
