Study Title: Acute inorganic nitrate ingestion does not impact oral microbial composition, cognitive function, or high-intensity exercise performance in female team-sport athletes.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of acute nitrate (NO)-rich beetroot juice ingestion on explosive and high-intensity exercise performance, oral microbiota composition, and cognitive flexibility (i.e., function), before and after maximal intermittent running exercise. Fifteen women team-sport athletes were assigned in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design to consume concentrated NO-depleted beetroot juice (PL; 0.1&#xa0;mmol NO) and NO-rich beetroot juice (BR; 12.0&#xa0;mmol NO) 2.5&#xa0;h prior to performing a battery of exercise performance tasks and cognitive testing before and after the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 (YYIR1) running test. Resting plasma [NO] and plasma nitrite ([NO]) were elevated following BR (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). BR did not impact global composition or relative abundance of taxa in the oral microbiome (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05) or cognitive flexibility before or after exercise (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). There was no significant difference in performance during 20-m (PRE, PL: 4.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.27 vs. BR: 4.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.32&#xa0;s; POST, PL: 4.45&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.29 vs. BR: 4.43&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.35&#xa0;s) and 10-m sprints (PRE, PL 2.78&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.15 vs. BR 2.79&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.18&#xa0;s; POST, PL: 2.82&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.16 vs. BR: 2.81&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.19&#xa0;s), isokinetic handgrip dynamometry, medicine ball throw, horizontal countermovement jump, or YYIR1 (PL: 355&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;163&#xa0;m vs. BR: 368&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;184&#xa0;m) between BR and PL (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). These findings indicate that acute dietary NOmay not influence the oral microbiome, explosive and high-intensity exercise performance, or cognitive function in women team-sport athletes.
