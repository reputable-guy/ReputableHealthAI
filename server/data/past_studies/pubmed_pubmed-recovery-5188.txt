Study Title: Clinical efficacy of treatment with high-dose naloxone in comatose patients in the emergency medicine department.

Study Summary:
This study examines the clinical efficacy of high-dose naloxone in comatose emergency patients, focusing on its ability to enhance brain metabolism and reduce oxidative stress. A total of 120 patients were randomly assigned to a control group, which received conventional naloxone doses and a study group, which received higher doses. Key outcomes measured included clinical efficacy, time to awakening, blood gas indices, inflammatory factors, consciousness level, neurological recovery and adverse effects. The study group showed a higher response rate (96.67% vs. 83.33%), regained consciousness more quickly and had better blood gas indices and glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores (p<0.05). Neurological function recovery was superior in the study group, with fewer adverse reactions (6.67% vs. 20.00%, p<0.05). These results suggest that high-dose naloxone significantly improves treatment outcomes, enhancing wakefulness, reducing inflammation and improving prognosis in emergency comatose patients, making it a promising option for clinical use.
