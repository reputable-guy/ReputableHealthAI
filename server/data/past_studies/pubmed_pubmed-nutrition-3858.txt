Study Title: Are inflammatory markers associated with sarcopenia-related traits in older adults with sarcopenia? - A cross-sectional analysis of the ENHANce study.

Study Summary:
To explore the relationship between inflammatory markers and sarcopenia-related traits in sarcopenic older adults. Baseline data of the ongoing Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) study were used for a secondary, exploratory, cross-sectional analysis. ENHANce is a 5-armed triple blinded randomized controlled trial, in older adults (>65y) with sarcopenia defined according to the revised criteria of the European Working Group of Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) aiming to assess the effect of combined anabolic interventions (protein supplement, omega-3 supplement and physical exercise) on physical performance, compared to single/placebo interventions. Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), albumin, interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;), IL-6, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) were assessed at baseline. Spearman's rho (&#x3c1;) correlation coefficients were calculated to associate these inflammatory markers with baseline sarcopenia-defining parameters (handgrip strength, chair stand test, appendicular lean mass [aLM], gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery), physical activity (step count) and quality of life (SF-36, SarQoL). We included 40 sarcopenic subjects (15 men/25 women, age 77.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.8&#xa0;years). Contrary to expectations, the pro-inflammatory IL-1&#x3b2; correlated positively with handgrip strength (&#x3c1;: 0.376; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024) and IL-6 with aLM (&#x3c1;: 0.334; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0433). IL-6 inversely correlated with step count (&#x3c1;:-0.358; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.048). Subgroup analysis revealed important gender differences. IL-8 inversely correlated with handgrip strength in women (&#x3c1;: -0.425; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034) but not in men. In contrast, pro-inflammatory cytokines CRP (&#x3c1;: -0.615; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.019), IL-6 (&#x3c1;: -0.604; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.029) and TNF-&#x3b1; (&#x3c1;: -0.615; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025) inversely correlated with the SF-36 physical component score in men but not in women. Although Inflammageing might play a role in sarcopenia-related traits, this exploratory study highlights an important role of gender. Future research should take this into account when elucidating the Inflammageing-sarcopenia interplay.
