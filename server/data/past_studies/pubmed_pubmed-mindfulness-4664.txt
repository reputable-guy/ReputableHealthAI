Study Title: Effects of mindfulness in patients with mild cognitive impairment with insomnia: A double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Current research on the effects of mindfulness therapy on MCI and insomnia has been inconsistent. It is still a hot topic of research and discussion. This study aimed to improve the sleep quality, cognition, and mental state of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with insomnia. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy-five patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to the mindfulness (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38) or health education (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;37) treatment group. The primary outcomes were sleep, measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, and cognition, measured by The Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination. Secondary outcomes included insomnia, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. EEG signals were collected at rest with eyes closed in the mindfulness state. The power spectrum was analyzed from these data. Cognitive function and sleep quality were significantly improved in the mindfulness group (95% confidence interval 0.04 - 0.05, 0.03 - 0.04, -5.58 - -1.55, respectively). Anxiety and perceived stress scores were significantly lower than those in the control group (95% confidence interval 0.002 - 0.004, 0.009 - 0.013, respectively). The power spectrum differences in &#x3b4;, &#x3b8;, &#x3b2;, and &#x3b3; bands were significant between the rest and mindfulness states (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;.05). Good safety was achieved in both groups with no deaths or serious adverse events. Mindfulness improved sleep quality, cognitive function, and mentality of patients. Mindfulness practice caused deep relaxation in the brain and changes in electrical frequency bands associated with attention and cognitive tasks. Mindfulness learning can be performed successfully for individuals with MCI. Additionally, it is suitable for adoption in nursing homes.
