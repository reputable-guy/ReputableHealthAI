Study Title: Feasibility of the enhanced neuromuscular blockade recovery protocol with selective use of sugammadex in thyroid surgery with intraoperative neuromonitoring.

Study Summary:
To investigate feasibility of utilizing enhanced neuromuscular blocking agents with selective recovery protocol during thyroid surgery with intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM). Two-hundred and ninety patients were randomized into two groups: group A 0.3&#x2009;mg/kg rocuronium and group B 0.6&#x2009;mg/kg. Sugammadex 2&#x2009;mg/kg was injected if needed followed initial vagal stimulation (V0). Electromyography signals from vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves before and after resection were recorded as V1, V2, R1, and R2. In group B, 30 patients (20.7%) had V0 signals <100&#x2009;&#x3bc;V, compared to 9 (6.2%) in group A. After sugammadex administration, 144 patients (99.3%) in both groups achieved positive V1 signals. Group B demonstrated a shorter surgical time from rocuronium injection to V2 stimulation compared to group A, accompanied by a significantly lower incidence of intraoperative body movement (0 vs. 16 patients). 0.6&#x2009;mg/kg rocuronium with selective use 2&#x2009;mg/kg sugammadex for IONM in thyroid surgery can meet both anesthesia and surgery demands.
