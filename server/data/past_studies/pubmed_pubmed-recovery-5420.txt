Study Title: The Impact of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation on Ventriculoarterial Coupling in Post-Coronavirus Disease-2019 Patients.

Study Summary:
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) affects the cardiovascular system even after the acute phase of the disease. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation may improve post-COVID-19 symptoms. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program after acute COVID-19 on arterial stiffness, left ventricular function, and ventriculoarterial coupling (VAC). Forty-eight adults were examined 1 (T0) and 3-mo (T1) following recovery from COVID-19 and randomized 1:1 to participate or not in a 3-mo rehabilitation program. Matched subjects were enrolled as a non-COVID-19 group. Arterial stiffness was evaluated by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Left ventricular (LV) systolic performance was evaluated with global longitudinal strain (GLS). The PWV/LV-GLS ratio was calculated as an index of VAC. High-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured. At T0, convalescent patients with COVID-19 had impaired PWV ( P =&#xa0;.001) and reduced VAC ( P =&#xa0;.001) compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. PWV (8.15&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.37 to 6.55&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.98 m/sec, P <&#xa0;.001) and LV-GLS (-19.67&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.98 to&#xa0;-21.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.93%, P <&#xa0;.001) improved only in convalescent patients with COVID-19 undergoing rehabilitation. Similarly, VAC was only improved in the rehabilitation group (-0.42&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.11 to&#xa0;-0.31&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.06 m&#xa0;&#xb7;&#xa0;sec -1 &#xa0;&#xb7;% -1 , P <&#xa0;.001). A significant improvement in VO 2max was noted after rehabilitation (15.70 [13.05, 21.45] to 18.30 [13.95, 23.75] ml&#xa0;&#xb7; kg -1 &#xa0;&#xb7;&#xa0;min -1 , P =&#xa0;.01). Finally, hs-CRP was improved in both groups with a significantly greater improvement in the rehabilitation group. A 3-mo rehabilitation program in convalesced patients with COVID-19 enhances the recovery of arterial stiffness, left ventricular function, and VAC, highlighting the beneficial mechanisms of rehabilitation in this patient population.
