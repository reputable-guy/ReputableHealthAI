Study Title: The Role of the Pediatrician in the Promotion of Healthy, Active Living.

Study Summary:
Few children and adolescents meet federal nutrition or physical activity recommendations, and many experience poor or inadequate sleep and negative health effects from screen use and social media. These lifestyle factors exacerbate physical and mental health risks for children and adolescents. This clinical report provides guidance to help pediatricians address the nutritional, physical activity, sleep, media and screen use, and social-emotional factors that affect child and adolescent health and wellness. The recommendations in this clinical report aim to promote health and wellness practices for infants, children, and adolescents across several domains of influence, including the individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy levels.
