Study Title: Effectiveness of a Social-Media-Based Diet and Physical Activity Programme for Fathers in Japan: A Randomised Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Provision of healthy lifestyle support for fathers can improve the lifestyles and health awareness of not only fathers but also their children and families. Few studies have examined the effectiveness of education targeting healthy fathers provided via social media. Hence, we aimed to clarify the effects of providing fathers with information on healthy lifestyle habits via social media on their awareness and behaviours regarding diet, physical activity, and healthcare, in addition to such a programme's indirect effects on their children. This randomised controlled trial included 73 fathers of primary school children in Japan. The intervention group received information on 'healthy lifestyle', 'lifestyle-related diseases', 'healthy diet', and 'healthy physical activity' via social media six times every 2 weeks. Data were collected before, 3 months after, and 4 months after the intervention. The intervention was effective in improving some awareness regarding diet, physical activity, and healthcare. In addition, the fathers in the intervention group demonstrated significantly improved interest in their child's diet and exercise habits. Social-media-based diet and physical activity programmes for fathers improved their awareness and behaviour. Therefore, social-media-based health education programmes can be an important tool for increasing fathers' interest in their own health and in their children's lifestyles.
