Study Title: Dapagliflozin and Right Ventricular-Pulmonary Vascular Interaction in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) during exercise reduce pulmonary artery (PA) compliance, increase pulsatile right ventricular (RV) afterload, and impair RV-PA coupling in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin on pulmonary vascular properties and RV-PA coupling are unknown. To test the effect of dapagliflozin on right ventricular performance and pulmonary vascular load during exertion in HFpEF. Evaluation of the Cardiac and Metabolic Effects of Dapagliflozin in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (CAMEO-DAPA) randomized clinical trial demonstrated improvement in PCWP at rest and exercise over 24 weeks with dapagliflozin compared with placebo with participants recruited between February 2021 and May 2022. This secondary analysis evaluates the effects of dapagliflozin on pulsatile pulmonary vascular load and RV-PA coupling using simultaneous echocardiography and high-fidelity invasive hemodynamic testing with exercise. This was a single-center study including patients with hemodynamically confirmed HFpEF with exercise PCWP of 25 mm Hg or greater. Dapagliflozin or placebo for 24 weeks. Pulsatile pulmonary vascular load (PA compliance and elastance) and right ventricular performance (PA pulsatility index, RV systolic velocity [s']/PA mean) during rest and exercise. Among 37 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [8.5] years; 25 female [65%]; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.9 [6.7]; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), there was no effect of dapagliflozin on PA loading or RV-PA interaction at rest. However, with exercise, dapagliflozin improved PA compliance (placebo-corrected mean difference, 0.57 mL/mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.11-1.03 mL/mm Hg; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02) and decreased PA elastance (stiffness; -0.17 mm Hg/mL; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.07 mm Hg/mL; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001). RV function during exercise improved, with increase in PA pulsatility index (0.33; 95% CI, 0.08-0.59; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01) and increase in exercise RV s' indexed to PA pressure (0.09 cm&#xb7;s-1/mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.02-0.16 cm&#xb7;s-1/mm Hg; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.01). Improvements in pulsatile RV load and RV-PA coupling were correlated with reduction in right atrial (RA) pressure (PA elastance Pearson r = 0.55; P =.008; RV s'/PA elastance Pearson r = -0.60; P =.002) and PCWP (PA elastance Pearson r = 0.58; P <.001; RV s'/PA elastance Pearson r = -0.47; P = .02). Dapagliflozin increased resistance-compliance time (dapagliflozin, median [IQR] change, 0.06 [0.03-0.15] seconds; placebo, median [IQR] change, 0.01 [-0.02 to 0.05] seconds; P =.046), resulting in higher PA compliance for any exercise pulmonary vascular resistance. Results of this randomized clinical trial reveal that treatment with dapagliflozin for 24 weeks reduced pulsatile pulmonary vascular load and enhanced dynamic RV-PA interaction during exercise in patients with HFpEF, findings that are related to the magnitude of PCWP reduction. Benefits on dynamic right ventricular-pulmonary vascular coupling may partially explain the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04730947.
