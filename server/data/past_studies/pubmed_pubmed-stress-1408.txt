Study Title: The effects of positive psychology and physical activity on depression, anxiety, and stress among students with premenstrual syndrome: a single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Premenstrual syndrome affects many women in their reproductive years and often disrupts their social connections and work. This study aimed to compare the effects of positive psychology and physical activity on depression, anxiety, and stress among students with premenstrual syndrome. In this four-group parallel clinical trial with blinded data analysis, 120 eligible students who experienced premenstrual syndrome were recruited based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and randomly allocated to four groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) including three experiment groups as positive psychology, physical activity, and positive psychology, physical activity, and control group, using a simple randomization method. All four groups completed premenstrual syndrome screening and the DASS-21 questionnaire before the intervention. Then, the positive psychology intervention group received eight sessions of 70-90&#xa0;min weekly intervention, the second group received eight weeks of aerobic physical activity intervention, and the third group received positive psychology and physical activity intervention for eight weeks. The control group did not receive any interventions. The DASS-21 was completed immediately after the intervention and two months later by all four groups. In this study, the participants and investigators were not blinded; however, the analysts were. The recruitment process took place from September 2018 to March 2019. One hundred twenty participants fulfilled the study. The Data were collected and analyzed using SPSS (v18). Before and immediately after the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference in depression, anxiety, and stress mean scores among the positive psychology, physical activity, positive psychology, and physical activity and control groups (p&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.05). However, two months after the intervention, a significant difference was observed between the four groups so there was a difference between the scores of the three intervention groups and the control group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was no significant difference between positive psychology, and physical activity groups. No significant adverse events or side effects were observed. Our findings supported the use of aerobic physical activity and educational interventions based on positive psychology as non-pharmacologic interventions to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress. This research should be replicated in different settings. Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials; https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/trial/32363 (IRCT20130812014333N97), registered (11/08/2018).
