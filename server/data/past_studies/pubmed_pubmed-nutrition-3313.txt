Study Title: Reliability and Validity of Diabetes Nutrition Self-Efficacy and Behavior Measures for the "What Can I Eat" Diabetes Nutrition Education Program for American Indian and Alaska Native Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.

Study Summary:
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have high rates of diabetes and limited access to nutrition education. The "What Can I Eat? Healthy Choices for People With Type 2 Diabetes" (WCIE) diabetes nutrition education program was culturally adapted for AI/AN adults. This analysis was designed to evaluate the reliability and validity of items developed to measure diabetes nutrition self-efficacy (ie, confidence one can engage in specific behaviors) and diabetes nutrition behavior among participants in the WCIE program for AI/AN adults. This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the WCIE program for AI/AN adults. Baseline data were used to assess the reliability and validity of the self-efficacy and behavior items, which were collected via survey. Due to COVID-19 safety protocols, the intervention was conducted via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications), and both survey and clinical data were collected at home by participants. The study was conducted from January to December 2021 with 5 AI/AN-serving health care programs in Oklahoma, Illinois, North Carolina, California, and New York. AI/AN adults with type 2 diabetes who spoke English and had internet access were eligible. Sixty people participated. Analyses examined validity and reliability of diabetes nutrition self-efficacy and behavior items. To test reliability, internal consistency and factor structures of the scales were examined. To evaluate convergent validity, Pearson correlations were computed to examine the association of the self-efficacy and behavior measures with each other and with clinical indicators (ie, body mass index, blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c). Two self-efficacy factors were identified. Each showed strong internal consistency (Cronbach &#x3b1; &#x2265; 0.85; McDonald &#x3c9; &#x2265; 0.88) and was directly associated with diabetes nutrition behavior (P < .001). The factor assessing Confidence in Using the Diabetes Plate was inversely associated with hemoglobin A1c (Pearson correlation&#xa0;= -0.32, P&#xa0;= .0243). The behavior measure capturing Healthy Nutrition Behavior showed strong internal consistency (&#x3b1;&#xa0;= 0.89; &#x3c9;&#xa0;= 0.92) and was inversely associated with hemoglobin A1c (Pearson correlation&#xa0;= -0.38, P&#xa0;= .0057). Diabetes nutrition self-efficacy and behavior items developed for the WCIE program for AI/AN adults are valid and reliable. These items can facilitate rigorous and consistent evaluation of the AI/AN WCIE program.
