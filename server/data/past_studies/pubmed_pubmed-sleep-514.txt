Study Title: Investigating the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioural therapy in comparison to a sleep-monitoring application via integrated diary and actigraphy: A randomised-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Dissemination of digital cognitive behavioural therapy is a promising approach for treating insomnia in the broad population. Current evidence supports the effectiveness of the digital format, but clinical findings are often limited by the choice of control group and lack of in-depth therapeutic measures. This study was designed to investigate the specific effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy in comparison to a self-monitoring application. Participants meeting criteria for insomnia were randomly allocated (1:1) to 8&#x2009;weeks of digital cognitive behavioural therapy or 8&#x2009;weeks of digital sleep monitoring (control application). The primary outcome, insomnia severity, was assessed at baseline, 8- and 16-weeks post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes included the assessment of sleep via application-integrated sleep diaries and actigraphy. Linear-mixed models were fitted to assess between-group differences. Fifty-six participants (48 females, mean age: M&#x2009;=&#x2009;45.55&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13.70&#x2009;years) were randomised to either digital cognitive behavioural therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29) or digital sleep monitoring (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27). At 8- and 16-weeks post-randomisation, large treatment effects (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.87-1.08) indicated robust reductions (-3.70 and -2.97, respectively; p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.003) in insomnia severity in the digital cognitive behavioural therapy arm, relative to digital sleep monitoring. Treatment effects in favour of digital cognitive behavioural therapy were also found for self-reported and actigraphy-derived sleep continuity variables, indicating that sleep improved throughout the 8-week intervention period. Our study reinforces the role of digital cognitive behavioural therapy in achieving clinical improvements for patients with insomnia, affirming previous findings and supporting the specific effects of cognitive behavioural therapy.
