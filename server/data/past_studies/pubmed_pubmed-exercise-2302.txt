Study Title: Post-exercise hypotension after different volumes of combined calisthenic and walking exercises in older adults with hypertension: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to analyze the acute effects of combined calisthenic and walking exercises using different volumes on blood pressure (BP) in aging adults with primary hypertension. A total of 48 participants with primary hypertension aged 50-80 years were randomly assigned into two groups that performed two experimental sessions each: a non-exercising CONTROL session and a LOW (group 1) or HIGH (group 2) volume exercise session. The order of these sessions was randomized. The exercise protocols lasted 30&#x2009;min (LOW) or 60&#x2009;min (HIGH) and consisted of calisthenic exercises combined with continuous walking or jogging. Exercise intensity was controlled using a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale. BP was measured at baseline and after each session for 60&#x2009;min. Results showed that systolic BP was lower after the HIGH session at post 30' (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), post 40' (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), post 50' (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), and post 60' (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.02), and after the LOW session at post 30' (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), post 40' (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), post 50' (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), and post 60' (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) when compared to the corresponding CONTROL at the same time point. There were no significant differences in systolic and diastolic BP between the HIGH and LOW sessions. In conclusion, a pragmatic combined training session using different volumes acutely reduces BP in older adults with primary hypertension.
