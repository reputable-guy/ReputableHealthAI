Study Title: Outcome Expectancies, Effects, and Mechanisms of Brief Training in Mindfulness Meditation vs. Loving-Kindness Meditation vs a Control Condition for Pain Management: A Randomized Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the analgesic effects of a single session of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) relative to a control. A total of 100 adults with chronic or current problematic pain completed a survey and were randomized to a 20-minute MM, LKM, or audiobook control. Co-primary outcomes of pain intensity and unpleasantness and mediators of mindfulness and self-compassion were assessed pre- and posttraining. Expectancies were assessed pretraining. Pain type (chronic vs current problematic) was a covariate. Relative to the control, higher expectancies were reported for MM and LKM (< .001). MM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41,= .032) and LKM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.38,= .027) had medium effects on pain intensity, with greater decreases than control (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05,= .768). All conditions had small effects on unpleasantness. Mindful observing increased more within MM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.52,= .022) and the control (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.50,= .011) than LKM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12,= .50); self-compassion increased more in LKM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36,= .042) than MM (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27,= .201) and the control (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22,= .249). The mediation models were nonsignificant. Pain type was a nonsignificant covariate. Overall, MM and LKM were associated with positive expectancies and small-medium pain intensity reductions, which did not differ by pain type. Although MM and LKM were associated with changes in theorized mediators, these changes did not underlie improvement.
