Study Title: The Effect of Laughter Yoga Applied to Intensive Care Nurses on Their Perceived Stress, Job Motivation, and Mental Well-being: Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of laughter yoga applied to intensive care nurses on perceived stress, job motivation, and mental well-being. This study was a randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted with nurses working at the university hospital's surgical intensive care and anesthesia intensive care units of the third-level intensive care unit in Turkey. Data obtained from 30 participants in the intervention group and 33 participants in the control group were analyzed. The Nurse Introduction Form, Nurse Job Motivation Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale were used to collect data. Data obtained from the study were evaluated using the SPSS 22.0 package. It was determined that there was no statistically significant difference in the average scores of the pretest/posttest 1/posttest 2 of the Perceived Stress Scale (13.70 &#xb1; 3.33 to 14.57 &#xb1; 4.57, P > .05; 13.50 &#xb1; 3.15 to 13.48 &#xb1; 4.59, P > .05; and 13.56 &#xb1; 3.15 to 13.15 &#xb1; 3.49, P > .05, respectively) and Work Motivation Scale (59.70 &#xb1; 7.58 to 59.69 &#xb1; 7.98, P > .05; 60.30 &#xb1; 8.07 to 58.48 &#xb1; 8.94, P > .05; and 60.56 &#xb1; 7.86 to 57.93 &#xb1; 9.54, P > .05, respectively) for both the intervention and control groups of nurses. A statistically significant difference was found in the average scores of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale pretest/posttest 1/posttest 2 for the intervention group of nurses (50.90 &#xb1; 7.60, 51.50 &#xb1; 7.80, and 53.70 &#xb1; 7.08, respectively; F = 3.330, P = .043). However, the difference was found to be insignificant in pairwise comparisons in the further analysis (a = b = c). It was determined that there was no statistically significant difference in the average scores of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale pretest/posttest 1/posttest 2 for the control group of nurses (52.21 &#xb1; 9.89, 51.93 &#xb1; 10.45, and 51.03 &#xb1; 9.63, respectively; P > .05). The application of laughter yoga on intensive care nurses did not result in a significant change in perceived stress levels and work motivation. However, statistically significant differences were observed in the average mental well-being scores among the intervention group.
