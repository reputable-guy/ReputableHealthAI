Study Title: Relaxation intervention to improve diabetic foot ulcer healing: protocol for a pilot study with a nested qualitative study.

Study Summary:
A mixed-methods approach nested in a pilot three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention of progressive muscle relaxation with guided imagery (experimental group) compared to a neutral guided imagery placebo (active control group) and a group that did not receive any psychological intervention (passive control group). The purpose was to inform a future definitive RCT that will test its effectiveness. Qualitatively, this study examined patients and health professionals' perspectives regarding the relaxation intervention, in order to assess the acceptability and applicability of relaxation as an adjuvant therapy. Participants must have had a diagnosis of diabetes and diabetic foot disease; one or two active hard-to-heal ulcers at the time of the assessment; and clinical levels of stress or anxiety or depression. Participants were randomised and assessed at three timepoints after the first hospital consultation for hard-to-heal diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Rates of eligibility, recruitment, refusal, adherence to study protocol, participation in follow-up and dropout, and patients' satisfaction with the relaxation intervention were assessed as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were DFU healing; patients' DFU-related quality of life; physical and mental quality of life; perceived stress; emotional distress; adherence to DFU care; perceptions of DFU; as well as arterial systolic/diastolic pressure and heart rate. The results of this pilot study contributed to clarification and better elucidation of the benefits of relaxation techniques regarding patients' HRQoL and DFU healing.
