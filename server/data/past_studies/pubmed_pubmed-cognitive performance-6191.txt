Study Title: Gamified assessment of cognitive performance during moderate hypoxia.

Study Summary:
There is a need for rapid and objective assessment tools to identify people at risk of impaired cognitive function during hypoxia. To test the hypotheses that performance on gamified cognitive tests examining the cognitive domains of executive function (Gridshot), working memory (Capacity) and spatial tracking (Multitracker) will be reduced during normobaric exposure to moderate normobaric hypoxia. Following three consecutive days of practice, twenty-one healthy adults (27 &#xb1; 5 y, 9 females) completed five 1-min rounds of the tablet-based games Gridshot, Capacity, and Multitracker (Statespace Labs, Inc.) at Baseline and 60 and 90 min after exposure to 14.0 &#xb1; 0.2% (hypoxia) and 20.6 &#xb1; 0.3% (normoxia) oxygen. Both conditions were completed on the same day and were administered in a single-blind, block randomized manner. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was estimated via forehead pulse oximetry (SpO2). Data were analyzed using ANCOVA with a covariate of Baseline. Compared to normoxia (98 &#xb1; 1%), SpO2 was lower (p < 0.001) at 60 (91 &#xb1; 3%) and 90 (91 &#xb1; 2%) min of hypoxia. No condition x time interaction effects were identified for any gamified cognitive tests (p &#x2265; 0.32). A main effect of condition was identified for Capacity (p = 0.05) and Multitracker (p = 0.04), but not Gridshot (p = 0.33). Post hoc analyses of the composite scores for both Capacity (p = 0.11) and Multitracker (p = 0.73) demonstrated no difference between conditions. Performance on gamified cognitive tests was not consistently affected by acute normobaric moderate hypoxic exposure.
