Study Title: Progressive resistance training improves single-leg vertical jump after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: Non-randomized controlled trial study.

Study Summary:
The study was investigating the effect of a progressive resistance training program on the recovery of patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in terms of kinematics, kinetics and muscle strength. Longitudinal cohort study. Hospital laboratory. Of the 42 patients were finally included: 22 patients in the progressive resistance training group and 20 in the control group. Questionnaire, single-leg vertical jump, and muscle strength were collected preoperatively and at 16, 28 weeks, and 1 year postoperatively. At 28 weeks, the height of the single-leg vertical jump for the injured knee was 203 and 157&#xa0;mm (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.045) and the peak knee flexion angle after landing for the injured knee was 31&#xb0;and 23&#xb0; (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.027) in the progressive resistance training and control groups, respectively. The progressive resistance training group showed a significant increase in the knee extensor symmetry index after the 24-week exercise training compared from 58% preoperatively to 79% (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001) after training completion, which lasted up to 1 year postoperatively. Progressive resistance training significantly improved knee extensor symmetry, single-leg vertical jump height, and peak knee flexion angle after landing, outperforming the control group across all measures.
