Study Title: Improvement in physical function and lipid profile following low-intensity resistance training and a lower limb conditioning program in people with diabetic neuropathy.

Study Summary:
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) impairs glucose and fat metabolism and physical functioning. This study examined the effects of low-intensity resistance exercise training (LI-RT) and a lower limb conditioning program (LLCP) on physical function and lipid profile in DPN. Forty-five diabetic women with mild to moderate neuropathy (55.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;y) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: LI-RT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15), LLCP (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15), and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;15). The LI-RT and LLCP groups trained 3 times/week (90&#xa0;min/session) for 12 weeks. The LI-RT group completed 3 sets of 10 repetitions for ten exercises at 30-repetition maximum; the LLCP group performed 12 lower extremity motions designed for peripheral neuropathy; and the control group followed their routine daily activities. Physical function was assessed using the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Five Times Sit-to-Stand (FTSTS) test, and 6-min walking test (6MWT). Blood lipid profile was assessed. Both the LI-RT and LLCP groups significantly improved in TUG scores compared to the control group (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.05). No significant changes between groups were observed for the FTSTS and 6MWT. The LI-RT and LLCP groups, compared to the control group, showed a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.05), and triglycerides (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.001). High-density lipoproteins showed non-significant changes. Low intensity training involving resistance exercises or lower limb range of motion enhance physical function and lipid profile in patients with DPN. High intensity exercise could be risky and deter adherence. Hence, these gentler exercise programs offer viable options for enhancing health and fitness in DPN patients.
