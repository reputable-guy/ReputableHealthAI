Study Title: Variability of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with atrial fibrillation and determination of exercise responders to high-intensity interval training and moderate-to-vigorous intensity continuous training.

Study Summary:
Disabling atrial fibrillation (AF)-related symptoms and different testing settings may influence day-to-day cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) measurements, which can affect exercise prescription for high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity continuous training (M-VICT) and their outcomes. This study examined the reliability of CPET in patients with AF and assessed the proportion of participants achieving minimal detectable changes (MDC) in peak oxygen consumption (V&#x307;O) following HIIT and M-VICT. Participants were randomized into HIIT or M-VICT after completing two baseline CPETs: one with cardiac stress technologists (CPET) and the other with a research team of exercise specialists (CPET). Additional CPET was completed following 12 weeks of twice-weekly training. The reliability of CPETand CPETwas assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dependenttests. The MDC score was calculated for V&#x307;Ousing a reliable change index. The proportion of participants achieving MDC was compared between HIIT and M-VICT using chi-square analysis. Eighteen participants (69&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;7 years, 33% females) completed two baseline CPETs. The ICCs were significant for all measured variables. However, peak power output (PO: 124 &#xb1; 40&#xa0;vs. 148&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;40 watts,&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and HR (HR: 136 &#xb1; 22&#xa0;vs. 148 &#xb1; 30&#xa0;bpm,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.023) were significantly greater in CPETthan CPET. Few participants achieved MDC in V&#x307;O(5.6&#x2009;mL/kg/min) with no difference between HIIT (0%) and M-VICT (10.0%,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.244). POand HRdiffered significantly in patients with AF when CPETs were repeated under different settings. Caution must be practised when prescribing exercise intensity based on these measures as under-prescription may increase the number of exercise non-responders.
