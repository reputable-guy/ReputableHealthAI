Study Title: Comparison of Forward-Leaning and Fowler Position: Effects on Vital Signs, Pain, and Anxiety Scores in Children With Asthma Exacerbations.

Study Summary:
It is essential to relieve bronchospasm or specific asthma symptoms by administering immediate inhaler treatment during an asthma exacerbation. The present study compared the effect of Fowler position and forward-leaning positions during nebulization on heart rate, S, breathing frequency, pain, and anxiety levels in children experiencing asthma exacerbations. The data originated from a randomized trial that compared 86 participants (study group43, control group43) who presented to the pediatric emergency department with asthma exacerbations between October 2019-February 2020. The subjects were administered nebulization 3 times, during which the study group was placed in the forward-leaning position and the control group in the routine Fowler position. The subjects provided information on chest pain and anxiety levels before and after nebulization, and heart rate, S, and breathing frequency were measured before and after each nebulization. The difference in the mean Smeasured at admission and after the third nebulization was significantly higher (3.2 &#xb1; 1.5% vs 2.3 &#xb1; 1.9%,= .01); the difference in the mean breathing frequency was considerably higher (-6.0 &#xb1; 1.7 breaths/min vs -3.2 &#xb1; 1.8 breaths/min,< .001), and the difference in the mean pain scores was significantly higher (-3.3 &#xb1; 2.5 vs -2.0 &#xb1; 2.3,= .02) in the study group than in the control group. In addition, after the third nebulization, the breathing frequency (22.8 &#xb1; 2.8 breaths/min vs 24.2 &#xb1; 2.7 breaths/min,= .02) and pain score of the study group were lower (0.8 &#xb1; 1.3 vs 1.5 &#xb1; 1.5,= .01). There was no difference in the mean heart rate (20.6 &#xb1; 16.2 beats/min vs 20.0 &#xb1; 15.4 beats/min,= .85) and anxiety levels (-2.0 &#xb1; 2.2 vs -1.9 &#xb1; 2.2,= .90) between the groups. Placing children in a forward-leaning position during nebulization was effective in improving Sand reducing breathing frequency and chest pain. The forward-leaning position implemented during nebulization is a non-pharmacologic method that supports recovery in children with asthma exacerbations.
