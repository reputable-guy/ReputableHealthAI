Study Title: Effect of Mindfulness Training on Skill Performance in Simulator-Based Knee Arthroscopy Training for Novice Residents-A Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Negative emotions affect not only the physical health of residents but also the performance of surgical skills. Mindfulness training has been shown to be effective in improving mood. However, few studies have explored its effect on surgical skill performance. We aimed to investigate the effect of mindfulness training on knee arthroscopy skill performance. We recruited 30 participants for knee arthroscopy skills training (Tasks 1-7) on a simulator, after which a pretest (Tasks 8 and 9) was conducted to test their skill performance and psychological states (including mindfulness state, anxiety, stress, and depression). Then, they were randomly assigned into 2 groups: the intervention group underwent 2 weeks of mindfulness training while the control group received no intervention. All participants were asked to retrain their skills 1 week after completing the initial arthroscopy skill training. After the 2-week mindfulness training intervention, a post-test was performed to detect the difference in skill performance and psychological states between 2 groups. We used the fNIRS device to record prefrontal cortex activation during the post-test. The study was carried out at the Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. 30 novice orthopedic residents. A total of 30 residents completed all the study programs. We did not observe differences in arthroscopy skill performance at pretest. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvement in total score of Task 8 (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.034) and 9 (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.002), as well as significant relief in anxiety (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.037) and stress (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.027) symptoms but no improvement in depression (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.828). No statistical difference in 2 groups was observed on the activation of the left prefrontal cortex (p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.68). Two weeks of mindfulness training can improve arthroscopy skill performance while alleviating anxiety and reducing stress in novice residents. Mindfulness training may be an effective adjunct to surgical skill training. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Number: ChiCTR2200058144.
