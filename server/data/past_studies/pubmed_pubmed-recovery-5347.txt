Study Title: Changes in bone density and microarchitecture following treatment of Graves' disease and the effects of vitamin D supplementation. A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Thyrotoxicosis leads to loss of bone mass. Vitamin D is important to bone health. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we showed that bone restoration did not improve when adding vitamin D supplementation to standard care of Graves' disease thyrotoxicosis. Bone density and microarchitecture improved markedly with treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Vitamin D is important to skeletal health and ensuring a replete vitamin D status is recommended. In thyrotoxicosis, bone turnover is increased and bone mass density (BMD) reduced. We examined whether vitamin D supplementation improves bone recovery in thyrotoxicosis caused by Graves' disease (GD). Using a double-blinded design, hyperthyroid patients with GD were randomized to vitamin D3 70&#xa0;&#xb5;g/day (2800&#xa0;IU) or similar placebo as add-on to antithyroid drugs (ATD). At baseline and 9&#xa0;months, we measured BMD and bone architecture using DXA and high resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography. Bone turnover markers (BTM) were measured at 3&#xa0;months also. Effect of vitamin D versus placebo and the response to ATD treatment were analyzed using linear mixed modelling. Eighty-six GD patients were included (age 41&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14&#xa0;years, 86% females). Compared to placebo, vitamin D3 did not improve BMD or microarchitecture. In response to ATD, BMD increased in the hip by 2% (95%CI: 1-4%). Cortical porosity decreased in tibia (-&#x2009;7% [95%CI:&#x2009;-&#x2009;12 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;2%]) and radius [-&#x2009;14% [95%CI:&#x2009;-&#x2009;24 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;3%]), and trabecular thickness increased (tibia (5% [95%CI: 2&#x2009;-&#x2009;9%]) and radius (4% [95%CI: 1-7%]). Changes in BTM, but not thyroid hormones, were associated with changes in BMD by DXA and with changes in the cortical compartment. In newly diagnosed GD, 9&#xa0;months of high dose vitamin D3 supplementation does not offer benefit by improving skeletal health. Treatment of thyrotoxicosis is associated with the recovery of BMD and microarchitecture. NCT02384668.
