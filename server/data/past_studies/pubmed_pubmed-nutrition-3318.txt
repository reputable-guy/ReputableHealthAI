Study Title: Endothelial function in healthy centenarians living in the Madonie's district (Italy).

Study Summary:
Endothelial function declines with age and plays a critical role in cardiovascular health. Therefore, investigating endothelial function in successful aging models, such as centenarians, is of interest. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery is the gold standard for measuring endothelial function in vivo in humans. Therefore, we investigated, for the first time, the FMD of the brachial artery in a group of healthy centenarians. Selected as part of the ABCD project (nutrition, cardiovascular wellness, and diabetes) centenarians (aged &#x2265;100&#xa0;years) living in the municipalities of Madonie (Palermo, Italy) were compared with a younger (aged <65&#xa0;years) sex-matched control group from the ABCD general cohort. FMD of the brachial artery was measured in all participants using a real-time computed video analysis system for B-mode ultrasound images. Body composition (bioimpedance), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were also measured. Eleven participants (males 36.4&#xa0;%; age: 101&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1&#xa0;years) out of 28 healthy centenarians successfully cooperated with the FMD test procedures, which require remaining with the upper limb immobile for approximately 10&#xa0;min. This subgroup was compared with a control group of 76 healthy and younger individuals (males 36.8&#xa0;%; aged: 41&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;14&#xa0;years; P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Centenarians exhibited better endothelial function than the control group (FMD: 12.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;4.3 vs 8.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;%; P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The carotid IMT was higher in the centenarian group than in the control group (0.89&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.09 vs 0.56&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.18&#xa0;mm; P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), whereas the ABI was comparable between the two groups. This small group of centenarians demonstrated an unusually favorable endothelial function, which may contribute to their unique aging profile. Further research is needed to determine whether FMD is a valid prognostic marker for successful aging.
