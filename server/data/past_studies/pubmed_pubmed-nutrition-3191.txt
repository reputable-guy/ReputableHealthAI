Study Title: Development and Acceptability of Shelf-Stable Microbiota Directed Complementary Food Formulations.

Study Summary:
A randomized controlled trial in Bangladeshi children aged 12 to 18 months with moderate acute malnutrition found that dietary supplementation with the microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF-2) significantly improved weight gain and repaired gut microbiota compared to the ready-to-use supplementary food. However, the MDCF-2 formulation was made daily from locally available ingredients and the need for a packaged, nutritionally compliant, and organoleptically acceptable MDCF-2 prototype was essential for future large-scale clinical studies. The study aimed to develop and assess the acceptability of 3 alternative foil-packaged formulations of MDCF-2 in comparison to current MDCF-2. Of the 3 packaged formulations, the Jumpstart version was provided in 2 sachets, the other 2 formulations were provided in a retort-stable foil pouch extended by sterilization, and microbiological growth was monitored over 10 months. The acceptability study included 40 children aged 8 to 12 months living in an urban slum in Dhaka, and the organoleptic properties were assessed using a 7-point hedonic scale. In the 100 g distributed over the 2 sessions, children consumed 82.5 &#xb1; 7.84 g (mean &#xb1; SD) of kitchen-prepared MDCF-2, 85.4 &#xb1; 7.15 g of the "Jumpstart" MDCF-2 formulation, 85.4 &#xb1; 8.70 g of the MDCF-2 with green banana powder, and 86.2 &#xb1;&#x2009;4.26 g of the MDCF-2 with sweet potato formulation. The "Jumpstart" MDCF-2 and MDCF-2 with sweet potato achieved the highest overall acceptability scores on the hedonic scale; although none of the shelf-stable formulations were significantly different from the kitchen-prepared MDCF-2. Packaged, shelf-stable prototypes of MDCF-2 exhibited comparable acceptability among Bangladeshi children aged 8 to 12 months to the original freshly prepared formulation.
