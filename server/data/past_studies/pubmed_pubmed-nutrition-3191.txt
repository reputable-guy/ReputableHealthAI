Study Title: The effect of an integrated workplace health promotion program on health behaviors targeted after 12 months: Results of a cluster randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
An integrated workplace health promotion program (WHPP) targeting multiple health behaviors by implementing activities at the individual and organizational level is potentially effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of implemented activities on targeted health behaviors. Data from four organizations in a cluster randomized controlled trial, including 173 employees, were used. Linear multilevel analyses or generalized estimating equations were conducted to assess within- and between-condition differences for physical activity (PA) and nutrition. No between-condition differences were apparent for both health behaviors. Within the PA intervention condition, moderate PA increased and light PA decreased. Within the control condition the odds to consume more sugary drinks was lower. Implemented activities did not affect the targeted health behaviors, although moderate PA increased within the PA intervention condition. Small sample sizes and implementation of minimal, irregular activities may underly the absence of effect. Future research should address this.
