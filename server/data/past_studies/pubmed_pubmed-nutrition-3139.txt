Study Title: Effects of branched-chain amino acids on changes in body composition during the recovery period following tonsillectomy.

Study Summary:
In recent decades studies have examined body weight changes following tonsillectomy. In nutrition science, the focus has shifted from body mass index to body composition analysis. However, no studies have explored body composition changes post-tonsillectomy. In oncology and digestive surgeries, the potential benefits of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been investigated; however, their effects on pharyngeal surgery remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the body composition changes after tonsillectomy and to explore the potential benefits of branched-chain amino acids. This prospective interventional controlled study enrolled 48 patients who were randomly assigned to a control group (CG) and an experimental group (EG). These groups were further divided into active and inactive subgroups on the basis of their activity levels. The EG consumed 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;4&#xa0;mg of BCAA daily. Body composition was measured using bioimpedance (InBody 270) on the day of surgery and again on days 7 and 21 postoperatively. Both groups experienced similar weight loss; however, significant differences in body composition emerged. The CG showed significant muscle mass loss (from 30,29 to 28,51&#xa0;kg), whereas active EG members maintained muscle mass (from 35,33 to 35,40&#xa0;kg); inactive EG members increased muscle mass (from 26,70 to 27,56&#xa0;kg) and reduced body fat percentage (from 31.94% to 29.87%). The general health status (InBody score) remained stable or improved in the EG (from 75,13 to 75,96); however, it decreased in the CG (from 75,42 to 72,67). The negative effects of tonsillectomy on body composition are mitigated by BCAA supplementation.
