Study Title: The effect of video-assisted training on upper extremity problems and functions after rotator cuff repair: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, and is frequently exposed to injuries. The applied surgical treatments, protection of the shoulder after surgery, care in the use of the shoulder in activities of daily living (ADLs) and gradual exercise programs are all vital to the recovery process. The present study investigates the effect of video-assisted training (VAT) on upper extremity complications and functions after rotator cuff repair (RCR). Included in this prospective, parallel two-armed, randomized controlled study were an experimental group (n: 24) that received VAT detailing early postoperative care for RCR and instructions on performing ADLs, and that had access to a 90-day gradual exercise program, and a control group (n: 24) that received routine care. The primary outcomes were upper extremity problems and functions, as assessed by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and modified Constant-Murley scores (MCM), while secondary outcomes were complications that had developed within the past three months. The outcomes were measured at baseline, after six weeks and at three months. After 3 months, a statistically significant difference was noted in the DASH-Work (p = 0.001) and MCM ADLs scores (p = 0.003) of the two groups, and significant changes in which the scale scores of both groups when compared to the initial measurement. Only one patient in the VAT group developed complications after RCR at one month; there were no significant differences in the complications of the two groups (p = 0.235). VAT can increase function in RCR patients. Healthcare professionals, especially nurses, can use the VAT method to improve shoulder function in patients after RCR.
