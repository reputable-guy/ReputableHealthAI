Study Title: The Influence of Acute Oral Lactate Supplementation on Responses to Cycle Ergometer Exercise: A Randomized, Crossover Pilot Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential ergogenic effects of an oral lactate supplement. For this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, fifteen recreational exercisers (nine males, six females) ingested a placebo or a commercially available lactate supplement prior to cycle ergometer exercise. Primary outcomes included peak oxygen uptake (VO; via indirect calorimetry), VOat the ventilatory threshold, and work rate at the lactate threshold (arterialized venous blood from a heated hand) determined during incremental exercise to fatigue, and power output during a 20-min cycling time trial. Compared with placebo, the oral lactate supplement (19 &#xb1; 1 mg/kg body mass) did not influence VO(placebo: 44.3 &#xb1; 7.8 vs. oral lactate: 44.3 &#xb1; 7.1 mL/kg/min (mean &#xb1; SD);= 0.87), VOat the ventilatory threshold (placebo: 1.63 &#xb1; 0.25 vs. oral lactate: 1.65 &#xb1; 0.23 L/min;= 0.82), or work rate at the lactate threshold (placebo: 179 &#xb1; 69 vs. oral lactate: 179 &#xb1; 59 W;= 0.41). Throughout the 20-min time trial, the work rate was slightly greater (4%) with oral lactate (204 &#xb1; 41 W) compared with placebo (197 &#xb1; 41 W; main effect of treatment= 0.02). Collectively, these data suggest that this commercially available lactate supplement did not acutely influence the physiological responses to incremental cycle ergometer exercise but elicited a modest ergogenic effect during the short-duration time trial.
