Study Title: Changes of oxidative stress in 3D film to be prepared for echocardiography: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Echocardiography (ECHO) is a nonprocedure that causes acute stress in children. Fear, anxiety, and fluctuations in children's blood pressure and heart rate can potentially lead to alterations in echocardiographic measurements. The insufficient research on virtual reality pediatric preparation applications, particularly in the context of echocardiographic procedures, underscores the necessity for additional studies focusing on pediatric patients. This study sought to assess the impact of virtual reality applications tailored explicitly for ECHO on children's oxidative stress levels. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study. Forty-eight children (experimental/24, control/24) aged 7 to 12 years who had an ECHO appointment in the pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic in the 3 months from June to August 2019 participated in the study. Participants whose blood analyses showed hemolysis were eliminated, and the study was completed with 37 children in total: 16 children in the experiment and 21 children in the control. Post hoc power analysis was performed for sample adequacy, and the power of the study was found to be 0.99. A 3D film was prepared for the research and applied to the experimental group before the procedure. All children's oxidative stress levels (cortisol, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide) and glutathione levels were checked after ECHO. The stress hormone cortisol and malondialdehyde levels were lower in the 3D-applied experimental group than in the control group. As another crucial anti-stress antioxidant factor, glutathione level increased in the experimental group compared to the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). The research revealed that the 3D film used to prepare ECHO reduces the stress parameters associated with heart risk and may affect the ECHO measurements. At the same time, the study also proved the positive effect of 3D film preparation by increasing the anti-stress factor.
