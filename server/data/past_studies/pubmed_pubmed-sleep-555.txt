Study Title: Real-time procedure information sharing as a means to reduce perioperative anxiety in families of children undergoing elective surgery - a randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
To investigate whether the surgical process information sharing system could alleviate the parental anxiety during a pediatric selective operation. Randomized controlled trial. A questionnaire survey was conducted one day before surgery for the enrolled participants. Family members assigned to the intervention group received real-time process information sharing through service reminders during the surgical period, while the control group received standard perioperative education. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate sleep quality during the perioperative period, and the State of Cohesion-13 Scale (SOC-13) and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to assess anxiety levels. Satisfaction levels during the perioperative period were assessed through a follow-up survey conducted one day after surgery. The intervention group showed better scores in terms of PSQI, SOC-13, SAS, and postoperative satisfaction levels at various time points compared to the control group, with statistically significant differences observed (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Real-time process information sharing is effective in reducing perioperative sleep disorders and anxiety among family members of pediatric patients, as well as improving satisfaction levels. This approach not only establishes a process and mechanism for effective doctor-patient communication but also helps implement continuous perioperative care, thereby optimizing internet healthcare services.
