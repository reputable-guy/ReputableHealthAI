Study Title: Effects of an online mindfulness-based intervention on brain haemodynamics: a pilot randomized controlled trial using functional near-infrared spectroscopy.

Study Summary:
Although many neuroimaging studies have evaluated changes in the prefrontal cortex during mindfulness-based interventions, most of these studies were cross-sectional studies of skilled participants or involved pre-post comparisons before and after a single session. While functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a useful tool to capture changes in the hemodynamic response of the prefrontal cortex during continuous mindfulness-based intervention, its ability to detect the accumulated effects of continuous mindfulness-based intervention is currently unclear. We investigated whether a 12-wk online mindfulness-based intervention changed the hemodynamic response of the prefrontal cortex during a verbal fluency task. Eighty-two healthy university students were randomly allocated to a 12-wk online mindfulness-based intervention group or a wait-list control group. The integral values of oxygenated hemoglobin measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy before and after the intervention were compared to the values in the wait-list group. The intervention condition showed significantly greater functional near-infrared spectroscopy signal activation than the control condition; however, the effect sizes before and after the intervention were small. Thus, continuous mindfulness-based intervention could alter prefrontal cortex function, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy could be useful for measuring the accumulated effects of continuous mindfulness-based interventions. With a better understanding of the association between mindfulness and functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals, functional near-infrared spectroscopy can be used for biofeedback analyses.
