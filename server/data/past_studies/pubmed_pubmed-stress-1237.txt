Study Title: An Internet Mantram Repetition Program to Promote Well-being in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 6-week internet-delivered Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) for women recently treated for breast cancer. A secondary objective explored changes in perceived stress, psycho-spiritual measures, and cytokines in the treatment group compared to a waitlist.A feasibility study (ORBIT model Phase IIa) with a randomized controlled trial pilot was conducted. Eligible women recently treated for breast cancer were randomized to the treatment group (= 14) or a waitlist group (= 12) and participated for 12 weeks. During weeks 1-6, the treatment group received the MRP intervention while the waitlisted group was inactive. During weeks 7-12, the treatment group was inactive while the waitlisted group received the MRP intervention. The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of the internet-delivered MRP intervention protocol. Participants completed pre and post-intervention psycho-spiritual health assessments. A subset of participants provided serum for cytokine analyses at enrollment and week 6, coinciding with the period in which the treatment group receiving the MRP intervention.Overall study attrition was 19.2%. MRP adherence for both groups was 86% at post-intervention and 90% in the treatment group at 6-week follow-up. Pre-to-post-intervention analyses pooling both groups' data demonstrated decreased perceived stress (= .045) and increased spiritual well-being (=.004). IFN-&#x3b3; and IL-17A were increased in the waitlisted group and decreased in the treatment group (= 0.048).Feasibility of a 6-week, internet-delivered MRP intervention for breast cancer survivors was established. Psycho-spiritual variables and serum cytokines are suitable clinical outcome measures for future MRP studies with breast cancer survivors. Data suggest MRP may reduce perceived stress and support spiritual well-being in women with breast cancer; however, additional studies are needed.
