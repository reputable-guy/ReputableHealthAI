Study Title: Piano Training Enhances Executive Functions and Psychosocial Outcomes in Aging: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Preliminary evidence suggests that piano training may enhance areas of executive functions and psychosocial outcomes in aging adults. However, little is known regarding specific cognitive outcomes affected and whether or not enhancements are sustainable. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of piano training on cognitive performance, psychosocial well-being, and physiological stress and immune function in older adults. Older adults (N = 155, 60-80 years) completed an initial 3-h assessment of standardized cognitive and psychosocial measures. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups: piano training, computer-assisted cognitive training, or a no-treatment control group. Training groups completed a 16-week program with 2 group training sessions per week for 90 min each session. All participants completed a standard battery of executive functions (working memory, processing speed, verbal fluency), psychosocial measures (musical and general self-efficacy, mood), and physiological measures (cortisol and immune function) at pretesting, posttesting, and at a 3-month follow-up time point. The results showed that piano training and computer-assisted cognitive training enhanced working memory and processing speed as compared to controls. Piano training significantly increased verbal fluency skills in category switching, as compared to computer-assisted cognitive training and no-treatment controls. Participants in piano training demonstrated enhanced general and musical self-efficacy posttraining; however, no significant differences were found for physiological measures. Piano training resulted in a unique advantage in category switching as compared to computer-assisted cognitive training and no-treatment controls. Music training programs may mitigate or prevent cognitive deficits in verbal skills. NCT02564601.
