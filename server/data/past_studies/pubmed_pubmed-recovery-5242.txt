Study Title: A Randomized, Single-Center, Double-Blind, Controlled Case Study Evaluating Procedure Pairing of a Neurocosmetic Postprocedure Cream With Radiofrequency Microneedling for Facial Rejuvenation.

Study Summary:
Radiofrequency (RF) microneedling produces patient discomfort which deters patients from completing the recommended treatment series. The primary objective was to determine the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of a neurocosmetic postprocedure cream post-RF microneedling in reducing patient discomfort and enhancing recovery across the length of the study and, secondarily, to evaluate against a leading comparator. The third objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the neurocosmetic on self-perceived improvement and objective grading. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved, fourteen-day, randomized, single-center, double-blind, controlled clinical case study was conducted with 11 healthy female subjects, 6 randomized to the neurocosmetic and 5 to the comparator cell. Following a 7-day washout period, subjects received RF microneedling (face and neck) and applied the postprocedure cream twice daily for 7&#x2009;days. Objective and subjective tolerability, self-assessments, and clinical photography were performed immediately postprocedure, 24&#x2009;h, three and seven days following the procedure. The neurocosmetic was tolerable and safe. Erythema and stinging immediately decreased postprocedure, postneurocosmetic application. After 24&#x2009;h, 83% favorably agreed the neurocosmetic "reduced irritation on the skin post-procedure," and after 7&#x2009;days, 100% favorably agreed "experience with the product was positive and I would be interested in returning for a second treatment." The neurocosmetic reduced skin tone redness in the face and neck faster and to a greater degree when measured against a comparator. The neurocosmetic postprocedure cream improved patient discomfort and enhanced recovery when used immediately post-RF microneedling and after 7&#x2009;days. Pro00064211.
