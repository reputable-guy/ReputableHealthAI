Study Title: Efficacy and safety of Supine Daoyin in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to develop and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Supine Daoyin, a TCM PR technique, in hospitalized patients with AECOPD. This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial involving AECOPD inpatients recruited from April 2021 to December 2023 in five tertiary hospitals in China. Participants were randomly assigned to 14 days of Supine Daoyin group or control group and evaluated at days 3, 7, and 14 (posttreatment). The primary outcomes were LOS and CCQ and secondary outcomes were 6MWD, 30-STS, BI, Borg CR10, time on mechanical ventilation, SGRQ, mCOPD-PRO, and mESQ-COPD. Out of 369 participants screened, 228 were randomly assigned (Supine Daoyin group: n&#xa0;=&#xa0;114; control group: n&#xa0;=&#xa0;114). For primary outcomes, there was no significant between-group difference in LOS (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05), but for CCQ the Supine Daoyin was superior to control at days 7 (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01) and 14 (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). For secondary outcomes, Supine Daoyin groups showed robust and superior improvements in 6MWD, 30-STS, BI, Borg CR10, SGRQ, mCOPD-PRO, and mESQ-COPD (all p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), but for time on mechanical ventilation there was no significant difference in two groups (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). Supine Daoyin, a novel TCM PR technique, demonstrates safety and efficacy for AECOPD inpatients, yielding clinically meaningful improvements in health status, exercise capacity, and quality of life. This study offers a viable PR option for AECOPD patients with severe symptoms and limited mobility.
