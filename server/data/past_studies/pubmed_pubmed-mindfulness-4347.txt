Study Title: The effect of mindfulness on decision-making, inhibitory control, and impulsivity of substance use disorder in-treatment patients: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effects of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) in decision-making, inhibitory control and impulsivity compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD's) in Brazil. A randomized clinical trial was conducted with participants from a therapeutic community (n = 122). Decision-making (Iowa Gambling Task), impulsivity dimensions (UPPS-P Scale), and inhibitory control (Stroop Color-Word Test) were assessed before and after the MBRP 8-week intervention. GLM Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the effects of MBRP on different impulsivity measures. The results showed that MBRP+TAU improved the general decision-making score (p = 0,008) compared to TAU. However, no significant effects were found in impulsivity dimensions and inhibitory control in individuals with SUDs in the therapeutic community. This study found improvement in decision-making in the total IGT score; however, no effect for self-reported impulsivity and inhibitory control among middle-aged patients after an 8-weeks intervention of MBRP protocol in an inpatient setting. It adds information to the subject, with implications and possible directions to be followed by the next clinical trials with patients with SUDs in treatment.
