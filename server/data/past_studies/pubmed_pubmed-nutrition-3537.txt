Study Title: Impact of a multidisciplinary collaborative nutritional treatment model in patients who are critically ill with neurological disorders: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition is a widespread problem in critically ill patients with neurological disorders. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a multidisciplinary collaborative nutritional treatment mode based on a standardized unit for nutritional support on the outcome metrics in patients with neurological disorders who are critically ill. We enrolled 84 participants who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Yancheng No. 1 People's Hospital for neurological disorders between June 2018 and December 2021. The participants were randomly assigned to the control group and the test group. The control group received traditional nutritional support, while the test group was treated with a multidisciplinary collaborative nutritional treatment mode based on a standardized unit for nutritional support. We collected the general information, feeding tolerance (FT), nutritional risk score, and laboratory indicators before intervention, after intervention for one week, and after intervention for 2 weeks, and other data of the participants. After the intervention, the test group scored significantly lower than the control group in the incidence of gastroparesis and diarrhea, as well as the NUTRIC score, with statistically significant differences (P< 0.001). The prealbumin levels in the test group increased progressively prior to intervention, after intervention for one week, and after intervention for two weeks. Compared to the control group, the test group had higher prealbumin levels prior to intervention, after intervention for one week, and after intervention for two weeks, with statistically significant differences (P< 0.001). We developed a multidisciplinary collaborative nutritional treatment model based on a standard unit for nutritional support. This model can improve neural function, FT, and pertinent outcome indicators and is generally applicable.
