Study Title: A family-based and mobile-assisted intervention for lifestyle behaviors in youths: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a family-based and mobile-assisted lifestyle intervention in reducing weight gain among school-age children with overweight and obesity. A total of 164 school-age children with overweight or obesity and their parents were randomized to the treatment intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;82) or an attention-control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;82). The treatment intervention included three face-to-face education sessions, augmented by monthly text messages sent to parents on their mobile devices. The primary outcome was child BMI-for-age z-score. Secondary outcomes included child BMI, percent body fat, and actigraphy-assessed sleep as well as parental sleep quality. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention, with treatment effects analyzed using general linear models for repeated measures. Our results showed that children in the treatment intervention group had significantly lower BMI-for-age z score, BMI, and percent body fat than did those in the control group, with an adjusted mean difference of 0.31 units (95% CI: -0.59 to -0.03; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), 1.34&#x2009;kg/m(95% CI, -2.42 to -0.26; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), and 3.12% (95% CI, -5.93 to -0.30; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), respectively. No treatment effects were observed for child and parental sleep. Our findings suggest that family-based and mobile-assisted lifestyle intervention results in significant and sustained benefits to enhanced weight management for school-age children with overweight and obesity. Nurses planning and delivering childhood overweight and obesity treatment interventions should consider a family-based approach with the assistance of mobile devices.
