Study Title: Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Evaluate Young Adults' User Experiences with a Digital Sleep Intervention for Alcohol Use.

Study Summary:
Evaluating user experiences with digital interventions is critical to increase uptake and adherence, but traditional methods have limitations. We incorporated natural language processing (NLP) with convergent mixed methods to evaluate a personalized feedback and coaching digital sleep intervention for alcohol risk reduction: 'Call it a Night' (= 120). In this randomized clinical trial with young adults with heavy drinking, control conditions were+: web-based advice + active and passive monitoring; and: advice + passive monitoring. Findings converged to show that thetreatment condition group found feedback and coaching most helpful, whereas participants across conditions generally found advice helpful. Further, most participants across groups were interested in varied whole-health sleep-related factors besides alcohol use (e.g., physical activity), and many appreciated increased awareness through monitoring with digital tools. All groups had high adherence, satisfaction, and reported feasibility, but participants inand+reported significantly higher effectiveness than those in. NLP corroborated positive sentiments across groups and added critical insight that sleep, not alcohol use, was a main participant motivator. Digital sleep interventions are an acceptable, novel alcohol treatment strategy, and improving sleep and overall wellness may be important motivations for young adults. Further, NLP provides an efficient convergent method for evaluating experiences with digital interventions.
