Study Title: New parents' sleep, movement, health, and well-being across the postpartum period.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to examine changes and the bi-directional relationship in sleep and movement, and health and well-being among new parents and differences by sex. This secondary data analysis included both conditions from a randomized control trial to improve new parents'physical activity [PA] and recruited couples. Parents (&#x2009;=&#x2009;181, 117 couples represented 31.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.4&#x2009;years, 51.3% women, 83.3% White) completed questionnaires on regular overnight sleep duration, PA, mental health (perceived stress), physical health (physical quality of life [PQoL]), and well-being (life satisfaction) at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-month postpartum. Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models were stratified by sex to examine changes in sleep and PA with health and well-being across time. Sleep and stress were interrelated at different times for fathers (2 months), and mothers (8 months). Sleep and PQoL improved across time, with mothers reporting less sleep than fathers at 4 and 6 months. PQoL at 4 months was related to MVPA at 6-months. Life satisfaction and PA at 2 months was related to PA at 4 months. Mothers and fathers experienced different sleep and stress trajectories. Mental health improved postpartum with early connections to PA. Supporting the 24-hour movement behavior cycle and mental health across the parenthood transition may benefit couples.
