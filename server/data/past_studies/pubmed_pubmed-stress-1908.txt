Study Summary:
Chemotherapy is associated with many side effects, including pain and psychological distress, which affect patients' physical and psychological health. The aim of this study was to elucidate the efficacy of a pain management intervention (POLA) to promote pain, psychological distress, hope and post-traumatic growth in breast cancer patients, also, to undertake a preliminary evaluation of the intervention. A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in an Iranian hospital involving 42 breast cancer (BC) patients during chemotherapy. The intervention group received a 6-week group therapy (90 minutes per session) administered by a psychologist. Meanwhile, the comparison group received standard care. patients' Pain, psychological distress, hope and post-traumatic growth were measured at 3 time points (baseline, week 6, and 12 weeks postintervention). The study design was found to be feasible, with a recruitment rate of 61.64% and an attrition rate of 6.66%. Compared to the control group, the intervention group showed a significant reduction in pain, psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as a notable improvement in hope and post-traumatic growth (p < .01). These differences remained significant at follow-up (p < 0.05). The study population found the intervention acceptable, as evidenced by a high attendance rate of 90% and adherence rate of 90.47%. Psychoeducational intervention positively affects the pain, psychological distress, hope and post-traumatic growth of BC patients during chemotherapy.
