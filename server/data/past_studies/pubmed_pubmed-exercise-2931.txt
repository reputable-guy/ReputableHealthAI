Study Title: An Individual versus Parent Supported Physical Activity Intervention in Adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities.

Study Summary:
Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is inadequate in adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). This report describes the results of an 18-month clinical trial in adolescents with IDD, which compared changes in accelerometer-assessed daily MVPA, gross motor quotient, and leg press strength between participants randomized to an exercise intervention delivered to adolescents only (AO) or to the adolescent and a parent (A + P). The 18-month trial included a 6-month active intervention, 6-month maintenance interventions, and a 6-month no-contact follow-up. Adolescents in both arms were asked to attend 40-min remotely delivered group video exercise sessions (0-6 months = 3 sessions per week, 7-12 months = 1 session per week). In the A + P arm, one parent/guardian was asked to attend all group remote video exercise sessions and a monthly remotely delivered 30-min educations/support session with their adolescent across the 12-month intervention. Adolescents ( n = 116) with IDD (age ~16 yr, 52% female) were randomized to the AO ( n = 59) or A + P ( n = 57) arms. Mixed modeling, controlling for baseline MVPA and season, indicated minimal but statistically significant changes in MVPA across 6 ( P = 0.006), 12 ( P < 0.001), and 18 months ( P < 0.001). However, the change in MVPA in the two intervention arms did not differ significantly at any time point (all P > 0.05). Similarly, gross motor quotient and leg press strength improved significantly over time ( P < 0.001), and these changes did not differ between intervention arms (all P > 0.05). Parental involvement had no impact on changes in daily MVPA, gross motor quotient, or leg press strength in response to a remotely delivered exercise intervention in adolescents with IDD.
