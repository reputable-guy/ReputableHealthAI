Study Title: Vestibular Rehabilitation Using Dynamic Posturography: Objective and Patient-Reported Outcomes from a Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
Balance deficits are common and debilitating. Standard treatments have limitations in addressing symptoms and restoring dynamic balance function. This study compares a rehabilitative computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) protocol, computerized vestibular retraining therapy (CVRT), with a home exercise program (HEP) for patients with objectively confirmed unilateral vestibular deficits (UVDs). Single-center, randomized, interventional trial, with 1-sided crossover. A tertiary neurotology clinic. Patients with UVDs and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) score >30 were randomized to receive either CVRT or HEP. After completion of treatment, the HEP group was crossed over to CVRT. Outcome measures were the sensory organization test (SOT) and 3 participants reported dizziness disability measures: the DHI, Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) scale, and Falls Efficacy Score-International (FES-I). We enrolled 37 patients: 18 participants completed CVRT and 12 completed HEP, 11 of whom completed the crossover. Seven participants withdrew. The CVRT group demonstrated a greater improvement in SOT composite score than the HEP group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04). Both groups demonstrated improvement in participant-reported measures but there were no differences between groups (DHI: P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.2604; ABC: P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.3627; FES-I: P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.96). Following crossover to CVRT after HEP, SOT composite (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002), DHI (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03), and ABC (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.006) improved compared to HEP alone. CVRT and HEP were both associated with improved participant-reported disability outcomes. CVRT was associated with greater improvement in objective balance than HEP. Adding CVRT after HEP was superior to HEP alone. Multimodal CDP-based interventions, such as CVRT, should be considered as an adjunct to vestibular physiotherapy for patients with UVD.
