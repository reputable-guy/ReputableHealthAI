Study Title: Impact of National Lockdown Measures on the Association Between Social Media Use and Sleep Disturbance During COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis of 21 Nations.

Study Summary:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the extensive lockdown measures implemented for disease mitigation triggered a surge in round-the-clock social media use, giving rise to widespread concerns regarding its impact on sleep health. This meta-analysis examined the association between social media use and sleep disturbance during the pandemic, along with potential moderators. The dataset included 43 independent samples comprising 68,247 residents of 21 countries across 7 world regions. The three-level mixed-effects meta-analysis revealed a weak, positive overall effect size (= 0.1296, 95% confidence interval: 0.0764-0.1828,= 90). The magnitude of the effect size varied by the type of social media use: compulsive use exhibited a moderately strong effect size, whereas information-focused use showed marginal significance. The effect size was more pronounced in countries imposing stricter (vs. less strict) lockdown measures. Lockdown status also moderated this association, with a marginally significant effect size observed during lockdowns but a significant effect size after lockdowns. For demographics, samples involving emerging adults demonstrated moderately strong effect sizes, whereas those involving the general population had modest effect sizes. Notably, the interaction between the type of social media use and lockdown status was significant. Specifically, the positive association with information-focused use was significant only during lockdowns, whereas that with general use was significant after, but not during, lockdowns. However, compulsive use showed a moderately strong effect size both during and after lockdowns. These findings underscored the importance of considering multiple factors-such as the type of social media use, context, and demographics-when studying social media use and sleep health.
