Study Title: Waitlist-controlled trial of an online intervention to address mental health among older people living with HIV.

Study Summary:
Older people living with HIV (PLWH) often experience elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness.This waitlist-controlled trial examined the effectiveness of online audio mindfulness lessons in impacting these feelings among older PLWH.Among 214 participants, the mean (SD) age was 60.4 (5.9) years, 89% were male, and 69% were white. After 25 days, the intervention group showed significant improvements versus the waitlist control group in symptoms of depression (20.3% improvement,&#xa0;&#xa0;< .01) and symptoms of anxiety (22.4% improvement,&#xa0;&#xa0;= .03), but not in loneliness as measured by a Daily Diary (12.9% improvement,&#xa0;&#xa0;= .07) or the 3-Item Loneliness Scale (4.8% improvement,&#xa0;&#xa0;= .27). Secondary analyses among participants with elevated baseline symptoms of depression showed a 26.3% improvement (&#xa0;< .01), with a moderate effect size (Hedge's g = 0.69). Similarly, those with elevated baseline symptoms of anxiety showed a 25.6% improvement (&#xa0;< .01), a moderate effect size (g = 0.54), while those with moderate or severely elevated loneliness showed an 18.9% improvement in daily loneliness (&#xa0;< .01), a moderate effect size (g = 0.55).This waitlist-controlled trial is the first to show that a series of brief, online audio mindfulness lessons improves mental health outcomes among older PLWH. For many patients, this intervention may offer relief that is both accessible and affordable.
