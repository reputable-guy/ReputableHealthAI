Study Title: A Scoping Review of Well-being Assessment and Interventions in Student Pharmacists.

Study Summary:
To review the literature assessing student pharmacist well-being and the impact of well-being-associated interventions.Of the 15 studies included, six assessed student pharmacist well-being while nine evaluated the impact of a well-being intervention. While various approaches exist to assessing student pharmacist well-being, the body of literature suggests, overall, that student pharmacist well-being is poor. Since well-being is multifaceted and individualized, some pharmacy schools have identified various ways to incorporate tailored well-being activities, including mindfulness, into required, elective, and cocurricular experiences within the Doctor of Pharmacy program, with varying outcomes.This review highlights the limited and variable information available on the assessment of student pharmacist well-being as well as unique strategies to incorporate well-being initiatives into Doctor of Pharmacy curricula. Schools of pharmacy should identify the well-being needs of student pharmacists through a standardized well-being assessment instrument and provide meaningful well-being resources and interventions within the curriculum. There is a growing need for faculty to invest in student pharmacist mental wellness in addition to academic success. Future accreditation standards will inform the Academy on how to advance well-being initiatives.
