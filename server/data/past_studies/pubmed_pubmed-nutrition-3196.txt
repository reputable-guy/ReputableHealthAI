Study Title: Effect of Customized Nutritious Breakfast and Nutrition Education on Nutritional Status of Preschool Children in Economically Underdeveloped Multi-Ethnic Areas: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial in Linxia, China.

Study Summary:
The nutritional status of preschool children in economically underdeveloped multi-ethnic areas is a global concern. This study aimed to examine the effect of a 2.2-year cluster randomized clinical trial that provided customized nutritious breakfast and nutrition education to preschool children in Linxia County, China. A total of 578 children aged 3 to 6 years were enrolled. After the intervention, the incidence of undernourishment was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group (8.73% vs. 9.92%, OR = 0.01 [95%CI 0.00, 0.39],= 0.014). Additionally, children with non-Muslim dietary habits had a lower incidence of undernourishment compared to those with Muslim dietary habits (OR = 0.05 [95%CI 0.00, 0.88];= 0.010). The intervention group also had a lower prevalence rate of wasting (OR = 0.02 [95%CI 0.00, 0.40];= 0.011) and a higher mean BMI-for-age Z-score (= 1.05 [95%CI 0.32, 1.77];= 0.005) compared to the control group. These findings suggest that providing nutritious breakfast and nutrition education is an effective strategy to improve the nutrition and health of preschool children, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions and among children with Muslim dietary habits.
