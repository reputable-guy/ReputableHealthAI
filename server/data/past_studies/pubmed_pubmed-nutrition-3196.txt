Study Title: Personalized Nutrition Therapy without Weight Loss Counseling Produces Weight Loss in Individuals with Prediabetes Who Are Overweight/Obese: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Obesity stands out as a primary risk factor for diabetes. Attaining healthy weight loss, especially reducing body fat, is important in managing prediabetes and preventing progression to full diabetes and its co-morbidities. This study examined the effects of personalized nutrition therapy (PNT) combined with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on body weight and composition in individuals with prediabetes. A total of 30 individuals with prediabetes who were overweight or obese were assigned randomly to either the treatment, observed CGM data plus PNT, or the control group which was blinded to their blood glucose results throughout the study. Both groups were provided with dietary recommendations for calorie intake and macronutrient distribution, coupled with personalized goal setting for glucose control and healthy eating, without any specific emphasis on weight reduction or changes in physical activity. Regular visits were scheduled every 10 days to perform measurements and replace CGMs. Data were analyzed using General Linear Model with repeated measures. Over the 30-day follow-up period, both groups experienced significant reductions in weight and fat mass. The treatment group exhibited two-fold greater reductions in both weight and fat mass, a significant decrease in carbohydrate intake, and a significant increase in time spent on physical activitycompared to the control group. In addition, compliance was notably higher in the treatment group. These findings indicate that overweight or obese individuals with prediabetes can achieve weight loss and improved body composition through personalized education for glucose control, without exclusively emphasizing weight loss as the primary objective. Additionally, the real-time feedback provided by CGM enhances these improvements.
