Study Title: Development of a targeted behavioral treatment for smoking cessation among individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

Study Summary:
Smoking cessation for individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is medically critical, but smoking for coping motives is a common barrier. In this evaluation of three treatment components (Mindfulness, Practice Quitting, and Countering Emotional Behaviors), we conducted two studies guided by the ORBIT model. Study 1 was a single-case design experiment (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;18); Study 2 was a pilot feasibility study (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). In both studies, participants were randomized to receive one of the three treatment modules. Study 1 examined implementation targets, changes in smoking for coping motives, and changes in smoking rate. Study 2 examined overall feasibility and participant-rated acceptability, and changes in smoking rate. Study 1: Treatment implementation targets were met by 3/5 Mindfulness participants, 2/4 Practice Quitting participants, and 0/6 Countering Emotional Behaviors participants. The Practice Quitting condition led to 100% of participants meeting the clinically significant threshold in smoking for coping motives. Incidence of quit attempts ranged from 0-50%, and smoking rate was reduced by 50% overall. Study 2: Recruitment and retention met feasibility targets, with 97% of participants completing all four treatment sessions. Participants reported high treatment satisfaction by qualitative responses and rating scales (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.8/ 5.0). Incidence of quit attempts ranged from 25-58%, and smoking rate was reduced by 56% overall. These two small-N studies provide complementary findings on internal validity and implementation of the novel intervention. While Study 1 provided initial support for plausibility of clinically significant change, Study 2 provided data on key feasibility parameters. Smoking cessation for individuals with COPD is medically critical. We conducted an early-phase evaluation of a novel behavioral treatment focused on reducing smoking for coping motives. Results provided initial support for plausibility of clinically significant change and feasibility of the intervention.
