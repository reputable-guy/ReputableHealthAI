Study Title: Effect of kegel pelvic floor muscle exercise on improving urinary disorder in rectum cancer patients after rectal surgery: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Postoperative urinary dysfunction poses a significant challenge for rectal cancer patients. While pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) has shown promise in other contexts, its efficacy following rectal cancer surgery remains uncertain. A clinical trial involving 79 rectal cancer patients found that initiating Kegel exercises post-surgery led to significant improvements in urinary symptoms compared to standard care. Adherence to exercises correlated with symptom reduction, with no reported adverse events. We have defined the main outcome of our study as the improvement in urinary function scores post-surgery. Effectiveness is considered as any statistically significant improvement in these scores. Early initiation of Kegel exercises shows promise in alleviating postoperative urinary dysfunction in rectal cancer patients. Further research is needed to optimize postoperative care protocols and enhance patient outcomes.
