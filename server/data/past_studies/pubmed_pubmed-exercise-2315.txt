Study Title: Impact of a physical exercise intervention on psychological resilience and mental ill-being in medical-na&#xef;ve children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a pilot randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The study aimed to evaluate whether a 12-week physical exercise intervention would improve psychological resilience and mental ill-being (e.g. internalising and externalising symptoms) in medical-na&#xef;ve children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In a parallel two-group randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, 30 children between 8-12&#x2009;years (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.62&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.37) formally diagnosed with ADHD were assigned to a 12-week physical exercise intervention group (three sessions per week for 60&#x2009;mins, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA] intensity) or a control group (treatment as usual). Psychological resilience was measured by a self-reported Chinese version of the 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and mental ill-being was assessed by a parent-reported Chinese version of the 113-item Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist. The 12-week physical exercise intervention with MVPA level revealed a significant improvement in psychological resilience (&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.82,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.038) and a significant reduction in internalising symptoms (e.g. anxiety/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, and somatic complaints) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.11,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.013) and externalising symptoms (e.g. rule-breaking behaviour and aggressive behaviour) (&#x2009;=&#x2009;21.09,&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) in the intervention group but not in the control group. Moderate correlations were revealed between the changes in psychological resilience and the changes in internalizing (&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.557,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.031) and externalising symptoms (&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.647,&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009) in the intervention groups (&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). The findings of this study provide initial support for the efficacy of physical exercise intervention on psychological resilience and mental ill-being and for the potential mechanisms of psychological resilience under the effects of exercise-induced mental ill-being improvements in children with ADHD.
