Study Title: Healthy hearts healthy minds: A randomized trial of online interventions to improve physical activity.

Study Summary:
Depressed individuals are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) than those without depression. People with CVD have higher rates of depression than those without and have higher mortality rates if they have comorbid depression. While physical activity (PA) improves both, few people engage in enough. We compared self-guided internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit, with Fitbit only to increase daily steps for participants with depression who have low PA. Adult participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;340) were recruited from two online patient-powered research networks and randomized to one of three study interventions for 8&#xa0;weeks with an additional 8&#xa0;weeks of follow-up. Using linear mixed effects models, we evaluated the effect of the intervention on average daily steps (NCT03373110). Average daily steps increased 2.8 steps per day in MBCT+Fitbit, 2.9 steps/day in CBT&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit, but decreased 8.2 steps/day in Fitbit Only. These changes were not statistically different between the MBCT+Fitbit and CBT&#xa0;+&#xa0;Fitbit groups, but were different from Fitbit Only across the initial 8-week period. Group differences were not maintained across follow-up. Exploratory analyses identified comorbid anxiety disorders, self-reported PA, and employment status as moderators. Changes in daily steps over both 8- and 16-week periods-regardless of intervention group-were minimal. The results emphasize the limits of using self-guided web-based psychotherapy with an activity tracker to increase PA in participants with a history of depression and low PA.
