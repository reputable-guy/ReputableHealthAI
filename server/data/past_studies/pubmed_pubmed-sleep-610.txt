Study Title: Depression, Anxiety and Poor Sleep Quality are Associated with Chronotype and Financial Wellness in University Students.

Study Summary:
Evidence suggests the importance of a person's chronotype in predicting various aspects of an individual's physical and mental health. While the effect of depression on sleep is well established, the impact of a person's specific sleep timing and chronotype on the prevalence of both depression and anxiety has yet to be fully understood, especially among university students, vulnerable to mental health problems. In addition, other factors also seem to influence the occurrence of depression and anxiety among students as well as their quality of sleep, one of which being the students' financial wellness. The objective was to evaluate the association between chronotype and the severity and prevalence of depression among Lebanese university students, while also taking into account the possible connection between chronotype and financial wellness and both anxiety and sleep quality.This cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2021 and February 2022; 330 Lebanese university students was included (mean age 21.75 &#xb1; 2.43; 67.3% females).The majority of the Lebanese university students in our sample were found to have an intermediate typology (63.0%), followed by the evening typology, which appeared to constitute 28.2% of the sample, while only 8.8% possessed a morning typology. In this study, having an intermediate or evening typology compared to a morning one was significantly associated with higher depression and worse sleep quality. In addition, having an evening chronotype compared to a morningness propensity was significantly associated with more anxiety.This study found a positive association between an evening typology (chronotype) and higher depression and anxiety and poorer quality of sleep. Although preliminary and based on cross-sectional data, this research could help provide a better understanding of the different chronotypes among university students, and of the possible increased susceptibility of some of these typologies (i.e., evening-type) to mental health problems.
