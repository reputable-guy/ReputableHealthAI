Study Title: Vitamin B12 supplementation improves cognitive function in middle aged and elderly patients with cognitive impairment.

Study Summary:
Objectives: to determine the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on neuropsychological function and disease progression in middle aged and elderly patients with cognitive impairment. Methods: this was a prospective case-control study. From May 2020 to May 2021, 307 participants clinically diagnosed with cognitive impairment in the Department of Neurology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were enrolled. A total of 115 patients were included in this study. Meanwhile, 115 participants with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned in equal proportions to two groups: vitamin B12 treatment group (n = 58, vitamin B12 500 mg/d intramuscularly for seven days, followed by cobamamide 0.25 mg/d and methylcobalamin 0.50 mg/d) and the control group (n = 57). Demographic characteristics and blood biochemical variables were obtained from all participants. Cognitive performance was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and after six months. Results: the vitamin B12 supplementation treatment patients who presented with cognitive impairment showed significant improvement, especially in attention, calculation (p < 0.01) and visual-constructional ability (p < 0.05), in their neuropsychological function compared to their matched group. Conclusion: vitamin B12 supplementation may improve frontal function in patients with cognitive decline. Vitamin B12 levels should be investigated in all patients with cognitive impairment.
