Study Title: Picturing the dance: intersections of gender, sexuality, and age in older women queer square dancers.

Study Summary:
A dearth of research has focused on the diverse experiences of aging sexual minority populations and, in particular, older sexual minority women. Studies that have disaggregated the population of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, queer, intersex and two-spirit (LGBTQIS+) older adults reveal that due to minority stress and a lifetime of disadvantage. Lesbians experience higher rates of chronic health conditions and mental health problems (including loneliness) than heterosexual women and greater financial inequalities compared to gay men or heterosexual women. Despite this, limited inquiry has explored the everyday lives of older queer women and fewer still draws upon women's commentary on their own lived experiences or centers older women as authoritative agents and experts on their own lives. In response to this knowledge deficit, this research traverses the aging experiences of female-identified members of a gay square dance (GSD) club in Toronto, Canada. We apply queer theory to explicate the unique ways in which a GSD club queers the aging process for 14 older women dancers. Findings of the inquiry highlight the ways in which these dancers confront and reject heteronormativity, while illuminating pathways to successful aging for older sexual diverse women. The older women dancers in this study perform gender in ways that challenged heteronormativity and gender binaries, enhanced belongingness and acceptance, embodied joy, and fostered wellness. These concepts have been identified as critical factors in successful aging and highlight what queering aging might look like for this resilient population who have overcome a lifetime of disadvantage.
