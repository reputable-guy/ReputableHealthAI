Study Title: Coingestion of Collagen With Whey Protein Prevents Postexercise Decline in Plasma Glycine Availability in Recreationally Active Men.

Study Summary:
Whey protein ingestion during recovery from exercise increases myofibrillar but not muscle connective protein synthesis rates. It has been speculated that whey protein does not provide sufficient glycine to maximize postexercise muscle connective protein synthesis rates. In the present study, we assessed the impact of coingesting different amounts of collagen with whey protein as a nutritional strategy to increase plasma glycine availability during recovery from exercise. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 14 recreationally active men (age: 26 &#xb1; 5&#xa0;years; body mass index: 23.8 &#xb1; 2.1&#xa0;kg&#xb7;m-2) ingested in total 30&#xa0;g protein, provided as whey protein with 0&#xa0;g (WHEY), 5&#xa0;g (WC05); 10&#xa0;g (WC10), and 15&#xa0;g (WC15) of collagen protein immediately after a single bout of resistance exercise. Blood samples were collected frequently over 6&#xa0;hr of postexercise recovery to assess postprandial plasma amino acid kinetics and availability. Protein ingestion strongly increased plasma amino acid concentrations (p < .001) with no differences in plasma total amino acid availability between treatments (p > .05). The postprandial rise in plasma leucine and essential amino acid availability was greater in WHEY compared with the WC10 and WC15 treatments (p < .05). Plasma glycine and nonessential amino acid concentrations declined following whey protein ingestion but increased following collagen coingestion (p < .05). Postprandial plasma glycine availability averaged -8.9 &#xb1; 5.8, 9.2 &#xb1; 3.7, 23.1 &#xb1; 6.5, and 39.8 &#xb1; 11.0&#xa0;mmol&#xb7;360&#xa0;min/L in WHEY, WC05, WC10, and WC15, respectively (incremental area under curve values, p < .05). Coingestion of a small amount of collagen (5&#xa0;g) with whey protein (25&#xa0;g) is sufficient to prevent the decline in plasma glycine availability during recovery from lower body resistance-type exercise in recreationally active men.
