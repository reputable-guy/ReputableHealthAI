Study Title: Crocus Sativus Linnaeus (Saffron) intake does not affect physiological and perceptual responses during a repeated sprint test in healthy active young males.

Study Summary:
The study aimed to investigate the effects of acute ingestion of saffron (SAF) on physiological (i.e., heart rate and blood lactate) and perceptual (i.e., ratings of perceived exertion [RPE] and feeling scale) measures in response to a repeated-sprint ability test (RSS) in healthy young males (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;22; mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD: age, 21.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.24 yrs.). All participants completed two experimental trials with a one-week washout period using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. In each session, the participants were randomly chosen to receive either a capsule of saffron (300&#xa0;mg) (SAF session) or a capsule of lactose (PLB session) two hours before performing the RSS.No significant differences (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05) were found for heart rate, RPE, and feeling scale between the SAF or PLB sessions at pre- and post-RSS. There were no significant changes (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05) in peak time, total time, fatigue index, and blood lactate in either the SAF or PLB sessions. Acute SAF ingestion did not significantly improve RSS performance nor physiological and perceptual measures in active young males. Future trials should address the topic by using shortened/prolonged higher doses of SAF on biological, physical, physiological, and perceptual responses to acute and chronic exercise.
