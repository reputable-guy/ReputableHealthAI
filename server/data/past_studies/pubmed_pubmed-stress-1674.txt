Study Title: Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Combined Antioxidant Therapy against Myocardial Reperfusion Injury: A Phase&#xa0;1 Randomized Clinical Trial in Healthy Humans.

Study Summary:
Myocardial reperfusion injury (MRI) accounts for up to 50% of the final size in acute myocardial infarction and other conditions associated with ischemia-reperfusion. Currently, there is still no therapy to prevent MRI, but it is well known that oxidative stress has a key role in its mechanism. We previously reduced MRI in rats through a combined antioxidant therapy (CAT) of ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and deferoxamine. This study determines the safety and pharmacokinetics of CAT in a Phase I clinical trial. Healthy subjects (n = 18) were randomized 2:1 to CAT or placebo (NaCl 0.9% i.v.). Two different doses/infusion rates of CATs were tested in a single 90-minute intravenous infusion. Blood samples were collected at specific times for 180 minutes to measure plasma drug concentrations (ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and deferoxamine) and oxidative stress biomarkers. Adverse events were registered during infusion and followed for 30 days. Both CAT1 and CAT2 significantly increased the CAT drug concentrations compared to placebo (P < .05). Most of the pharmacokinetic parameters were similar between CAT1 and CAT2. In total, 6 adverse events were reported, all nonserious and observed in CAT1. The ferric-reducing ability of plasma (an antioxidant biomarker) increased in both CAT groups compared to placebo (P < .001). The CAT is safe in humans and a potential treatment for patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing reperfusion therapy.
