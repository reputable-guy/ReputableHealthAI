Study Title: Effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention in the improvement of maternal role adaptation among first time mothers: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) has been suggested as a method to alleviate mental health difficulties during the perinatal period. However, few studies have examined its use in improving maternal role adaptation. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness in maternal role adaptation among first-time mothers. This randomized controlled trial study was performed on 40 first-time mothers who were randomly assigned into experimental (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20) and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20) groups. Research instruments included a demographic questionnaire and a validated Maternal Role Adaptation Questionnaire (MRAQ). In addition to receiving routine care, mothers in the experimental group attended eight 90-min sessions of mindfulness-based intervention. The control group, however, received only routine care. Both groups completed MRAQ before intervention, and immediately, one month, and two months after it. After intervention, there was a significant increase in the mean scores of MRAQ and its seven domains in the experimental group at all three follow-up intervals (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). These domains included "support and strengthening of the couples' relationships", "hardship and dissatisfaction", "mother-infant attachment", "stress and anxiety", "emotional growth", "functionality" and "social adaptation development". The intervention implemented in this study could be effective in promoting maternal role adaptation.
