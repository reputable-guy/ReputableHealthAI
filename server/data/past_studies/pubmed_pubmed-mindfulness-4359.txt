Study Title: The effect of&#xa0;a distance-delivered mindfulness-based psychoeducation program on&#xa0;the psychological well-being, emotional intelligence and&#xa0;stress levels of&#xa0;nursing students in&#xa0;Turkey: a randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Nursing students who started university during the COVID-19 pandemic had to attend via distance education, which increased their stress. This study aimed to determine the effect of a mindfulness-based psychoeducation program on the psychological well-being, emotional intelligence and stress levels of young adults in their first year of an undergraduate nursing program at a university in Turkey. The sample consisted of 59 students (mean age 19.3&#x2009;years) who were randomized to the intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29) and control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). Those in the intervention group participated in a mindfulness-based psychoeducation program twice a week for 4&#x2009;weeks via video conference. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB) and Revised Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS) were used as measurement tools. Between the pretest and posttest assessments, students in the intervention group showed a significant decrease in perceived stress scores and increases in emotional intelligence and psychological well-being scores. There were statistically significant differences in perceived stress, emotional intelligence and psychological well-being scores between the intervention and control groups in the posttest. Online mindfulness psychoeducation via video conferencing can be a useful intervention for nursing students to reduce stress and support psychological well-being and emotional intelligence.
