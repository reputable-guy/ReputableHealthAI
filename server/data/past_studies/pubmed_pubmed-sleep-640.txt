Study Title: Telephone follow-up as a substitute for standard out-clinic follow-up in CPAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea patients: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study assessed the feasibility of telephone follow-up consultations (TC) using an online data sharing and editing function (Airview&#x2122;), as alternative to standard out-clinic follow-up consultations (SC) on adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Furthermore, we investigated compliance to follow-up consultations and examined potential influencing factors, including baseline AHI (apnea-hypopnea-index), age, and distance from home to the hospital on consultation compliance. Two hundred OSA patients, with AHI5 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TC or SC with follow-up after one month and 12&#xa0;month of CPAP initiation. Adherence goal was defined as achieving4&#xa0;h of CPAP use daily in 70% of the days in a 365-days period. The proportion of participants achieving CPAP adherence was non-significantly lower in the TC group compared to the SC group (TC: 30% versus SC: 36%, adjusted OR 0.84, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59). Of participants who completed the study, the TC group had a significant average of 107&#xa0;min less use of CPAP compared to the SC group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). However, a higher proportion of participants was compliant to consultations in the TC group. The only influencing factor found was increasing baseline AHI, which might be a predictor for compliance to consultations&#xa0;and adherence to CPAP therapy. TC might serve as substitute for SC in some part of the OSA population. If TC becomes a part of CPAP therapy management, it is important to consider patient characteristics and treatment-related issues to prevent decline in adherence.
