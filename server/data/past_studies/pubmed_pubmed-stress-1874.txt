Study Title: Mindful Self-Hypnosis Combined with Resistance Training to Reduce Perceived Stress and Improve Other Psychological Factors in Female College Students.

Study Summary:
Perceived stress is a significant problem among female college students that can impact psychological distress, sleep, and overall well-being. Mindful self-hypnosis (MSH) and resistance training (RT) have both been shown to reduce perceived stress. The rationale for the present study was to investigate whether MSH combined with RT could be more effective at reducing perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale than RT alone due to synergistic effects achieved by combining the interventions. Forty-four female college students were randomized to one of the three groups: MSH+RT, RT only, or a wait-list control (WLC). Results indicated that, compared to RT only, the addition of MSH led to pronounced improvements in perceived stress which was significantly greater than WLC. Also, MSH+RT resulted in significant increases in mindfulness, sleep, strength, and well-being in comparison to WLC. MSH+RT was shown to be feasible with highly satisfactory participant ratings. Future research should examine the MSH+RT intervention with a larger population and with older women who are more at risk for stress and declining strength.
