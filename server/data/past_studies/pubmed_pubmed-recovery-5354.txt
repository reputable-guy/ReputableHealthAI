Study Title: Effects of auricular vagus nerve stimulation and electrical earlobe stimulation on motor-evoked potential changes induced by paired associative stimulation.

Study Summary:
Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). PAS can induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in humans, manifested as motor-evoked potential (MEP) enhancement. We have developed a variant of PAS ("high-PAS"), which consists of high-frequency PNS and high-intensity TMS and targets spinal plasticity and promotes rehabilitation after spinal cord injury (SCI). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) promotes LTP-like plasticity and enhances recovery in SCI and stroke in humans and animals when combined with repetitive motor training. We combined high-PAS with simultaneous noninvasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (aVNS) to determine if aVNS enhances the extent of PAS-induced MEP amplitude increase. Sixteen healthy participants were stimulated for 20&#x2009;min in four different sessions (PAS, PAS&#x2009;+&#x2009;aVNS, PAS&#x2009;+&#x2009;shamVNS, and aVNS) in a randomized single-blind setup. MEPs were measured before, immediately after, and at 30, 60, and 90&#x2009;min post-stimulation. Stimulation protocols with PAS significantly potentiated MEPs (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.005) when compared with aVNS (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.642). Although not significant, MEP enhancement observed after PAS (43.5%) is further increased by aVNS (49.7%) and electrical earlobe stimulation (63.9%). Our aVNS setup failed to significantly enhance the effect of PAS, but sham VNS revealed a trend towards enhanced plasticity. Optimization of auricular VNS stimulation setup is required for possible tests of patients with SCI.
