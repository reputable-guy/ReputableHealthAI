Study Title: Acute Effects of Wearing a Cooling Vest after High-Intensity Running and at Rest on Energy Intake and Appetite in Young Men.

Study Summary:
Body cooling during and after exercise stimulates energy intake (EI). Cooling vests can also reasonably decrease body temperature under various sport occasions. This study examined the acute effects of wearing a cooling vest on EI and appetite after exercise and rest. Fifteen healthy young men underwent four trials randomly in a thermoneutral room (~24&#xb0;C, ~40% humidity). In two exercise trials, participants performed a 60-min run at 75% of maximum oxygen uptake and wore a cooling vest (ExC) or thermoneutral vest (ExN) from 1030 to 1130 h. In two resting trials, participants rested for 60 min and wore a cooling vest (RC) or a thermoneutral vest (RN) from 1030 to 1130 h. From 1130 h, participants consumed a buffet meal until satiety. EI was calculated from the buffet meal. Skin and rectal temperatures were assessed between 0930 and 1130 h. EI was significantly higher in the ExC trial (1740 &#xb1; 642 kcal) than in the ExN trial (1584 &#xb1; 604 kcal) and higher in the RC trial (1879 &#xb1; 806 kcal) than in the RN trial (1726 &#xb1; 806 kcal). Hot food consumption was significantly higher in the ExC trial than in the ExN trial and higher in the RC trial than in the RN trial. Subjective hunger was significantly higher in the ExC trial than in the ExN trial. Lower rectal temperatures were associated with higher relative EI ( &#x3b2; = -8.871, P < 0.001). Wearing a cooling vest increased EI after exercise or rest and increased subjective appetite only after exercise. Increased EI may result from a preference for hot foods altered by a cooling vest.
