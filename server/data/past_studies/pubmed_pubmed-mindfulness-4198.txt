Study Title: Mindfulness-based intervention for hypertension patients with depression and/or anxiety in the community: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate mindfulness-based intervention for hypertension with depression and/or anxiety. 10-week mindfulness-based intervention, including health education for hypertension, exclusively for the control group, was administered to the intervention group to assist sixty hypertension patients with depression/anxiety. Among them, the intervention group comprised 8 men and 22 women, with a mean age of 60.02&#xa0;years and a mean duration of hypertension of 6.29&#xa0;years. The control group consisted of 14 men and 16 women with a mean age of 57.68&#xa0;years and a mean duration of hypertension of 6.32&#xa0;years. The severity of depressive and/or anxiety symptoms was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), along with blood pressure (BP) measurements taken twice daily. The study utilized a self-made self-efficacy scale and awareness of physical and mental health to evaluate mental health and state. The depression PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores reduced by 21.1% or 17.8% in the mindfulness-based intervention group, compared to the control (Z&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.040, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041) post 10-week period, suggesting significant reduction in anxiety/stress. These results were consistent with a reduction in systolic BP of 12.24&#xa0;mm Hg (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.041, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000). The self-efficacy score of the mindfulness intervention group significantly improved compared to the control (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.818, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), while the awareness of physical and mental health in the mindfulness intervention group significantly improved compared to the control (&#x3c7;2&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.781, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016). Mindfulness-based, short-term focused interventions provide modest relief for depression and/or anxiety and are effective in lowering blood pressure and improving self-efficacy scores.
