Study Title: Effect of a Single Light-intensity Walking Session on Sleep Quality of Patients with Bladder Cancer: A Randomized Cross-Over Study.

Study Summary:
Exercise has been recommended to enhance sleep. However, there is a paucity of studies investigating the relationships between exercise and sleep problems in patients with bladder cancer. The authors explored the effects of a single bout of light-intensity walking on the sleep quality of patients with bladder cancer who have sleep disorders. A total of 14 patients with bladder cancer with sleep disorders were recruited for this trial. The participants were randomly assigned to the walking or control condition in a cross-over design to explore the effects of a single light-intensity walking session on objectively measured sleep quality. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and a nonparametric permutation test were used to examine intervention effects. Twelve participants (85.7%) completed the trial. A significant group&#x202f;&#xd7;&#x202f;time interaction for sleep latency (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.023) was identified. The pairwise comparison showed significant results (P&#x202f;=&#x202f;.012) for the difference between the post-test sleep latency and the pre-test. No significant group&#x202f;&#xd7;&#x202f;time interactions were observed for the remaining seven sleep parameters. Additionally, only the main effects of time on length of awakening and time in bed were significant (P < .001). A single bout of light-intensity walking has a positive effect on shortening the sleep latency of patients with bladder cancer who have sleep disorders. Oncology nurses can encourage patients with bladder cancer to exercise, even light-intensity walking, which may improve sleep quality.
