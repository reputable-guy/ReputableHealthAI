Study Title: Effects of protein-carbohydrate vs. carbohydrate alone supplementation on immune inflammation markers in endurance athletes: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The impact of ingesting carbohydrates alone or combined with proteins to support exercise immune adaptation in endurance athletes is scarcely investigated. The present study compares the effect of ingesting a combined protein-carbohydrate supplement vs. a carbohydrate-only supplement post-workout on immune inflammation markers following a 10&#xa0;week periodized endurance training program in well-trained athletes. Twenty-five men completed the study after being randomly assigned to one of the following intervention groups: combined protein-carbohydrate (PRO-CHO n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12, 31&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9&#xa0;years, [Formula: see text]O61.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.6&#xa0;mlkg.min) or non-protein isoenergetic carbohydrate (CHO, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13, 33&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8&#xa0;years, [Formula: see text]O60.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.9&#xa0;mlkg.min). Treatment consisted of ingesting 24&#xa0;g of assigned supplement, mixed with 250&#xa0;ml of orange juice, once a day for 10&#xa0;weeks immediately post-workout (or before breakfast on non-training days). Measurements were conducted pre- and post-intervention on total leukocytes, leukocyte subsets (i.e., neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes), and platelets. The inflammatory status was assessed by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the systemic-immune inflammation index (SII). Post-intervention, significant increases were observed for CHO group only for the three inflammatory markers: NLR (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.050, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58), PLR (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.60), and SII (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.81) but not for PRO-CHO (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Ingesting a post-workout protein-carbohydrate combined beverage promoted a more favourable immune status than carbohydrate-only ingestion by attenuating cellular inflammation over a 10&#xa0;week training period in endurance male athletes. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with the following ID: NCT02954367. The study was registered by 3 November 2016.
