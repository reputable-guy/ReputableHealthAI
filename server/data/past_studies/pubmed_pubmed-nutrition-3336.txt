Study Title: Enhancing Nutritional Status and Addressing Micronutrient Deficiencies: Evaluating the Impact of Workplace Nutrition Program on Female Workers in Vietnam.

Study Summary:
This randomized controlled clinical study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a nutrition intervention program for non-pregnant female workers in Vietnam. A total of 500 female workers were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were provided nutrition education, personalized specific dietary, and received oral nutrition supplements (ONS)-which contained multi-minerals and vitamins according to recommendations for adults for a duration of 12 wk, while participants in the control group received only nutrition education. The result shows the percentage of malnutrition by BMI in the control group rose from 15.6% to 21.3% after 12 wk; the figure for counterpart experienced a remain unchanged (p<0.05). Additionally, the mean of serum zinc in the intervention group significantly increased from 49.0&#xb1;21.2 &#x3bc;g/dL to 53.6&#xb1;19.5 &#x3bc;g/dL after 12 wk. Moreover, the intervention group demonstrated significant increases in serum iron and total serum calcium levels (p<0.05), with from 13.9&#xb1;5.6 &#x3bc;mol/L to 15.3&#xb1;5.8 &#x3bc;mol/L, and from 2.36&#xb1;0.15 mmol/L to 2.4&#xb1;0.09 mmol/L, respectively. The participants of the intervention group were more likely to have higher total serum calcium (Coef=0.04, p<0.05), serum iron (Coef=1.99, p<0.05), and serum zinc (Coef=18.9, p<0.05), which presents a reduce micronutrient deficiency. In conclusion, workplace nutrition interventions effectively mitigate micronutrient deficiencies and improve the nutritional status of female workers.
