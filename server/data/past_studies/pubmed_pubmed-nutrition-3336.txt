Study Title: Effect of special types of bread with select herbal components on postprandial glucose levels in diabetic patients.

Study Summary:
Nutrition recommendations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are to consume rye or integral bread instead of white bread. A positive effect on glucoregulation has been achieved by enriching food with various biologically active substances of herbal origin, so we formulated an herbal mixture that can be used as a supplement for a special type of bread (STB) to achieve better effects on postprandial glucose and insulin levels in patients with T2DM. To compare organoleptic characteristics and effects of two types of bread on postprandial glucose and insulin levels in T2DM patients. This trial included 97 patients with T2DM. A parallel group of 16 healthy subjects was also investigated. All participants were given 50 g of rye bread and the same amount of a STB with an herbal mixture on 2 consecutive days. Postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels were compared at the 30, 60, 90and 120min. A questionnaire was used for subjective estimation of the organoleptic and satiety features of the two types of bread. Compared to patients who consumed rye bread, significantly lower postprandial blood glucose and insulin concentrations were found in T2DM patients who consumed STB. No relevant differences were found among the healthy subjects. Subjectively estimated organoleptic and satiety characteristics are better for STB than for rye bread. STB have better effects than rye bread on postprandial glucoregulation in T2DM patients. Subjectively estimated organoleptic and satiety characteristics are better for STB than for rye bread. Therefore, STB can be recommended for nutrition in T2DM patients.
