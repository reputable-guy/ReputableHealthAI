Study Title: Pelvic floor muscle training for female urinary incontinence: development of a programme theory from a longitudinal qualitative case study.

Study Summary:
Urinary incontinence (UI) negatively affects the well-being of women globally. Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) is a complex intervention that aims to decrease UI symptoms. Information about how the multiple complex components involved in PFMT achieve and maintain the desired effect are rarely studied as a whole. The evidence base lacks data about how women experience PFMT over time and in the longer-term. This study explored women's experiences of biofeedback-assisted PFMT and PFMT alone, to identify and understand what influenced self-reported adherence to PFMT, and UI outcomes over time. This rigorous longitudinal qualitative case study, nested within a randomised controlled trial, recruited forty cases (women with stress or mixed UI; 20 in biofeedback-assisted and 20 in PFMT alone group). A case included up to four semi-structured interviews with each woman (prior to starting PFMT, end of treatment [6&#xa0;months], 12&#xa0;months, 24&#xa0;months). Analysis followed case study analytic traditions, resulting in a Programme Theory about PFMT from the perspectives of women with UI. The theory demonstrates factors that motivated women to seek UI treatment, and how these influenced long-term adherence. Therapists who delivered PFMT played a crucial role in supporting women to know how to undertake PFMT (to have capability). Some, but not all, women developed self-efficacy for PFMT. Where women did not have PFMT self-efficacy, adherence tended to be poor. When women had PFMT self-efficacy, the conditions to support adherence were present, but contextual factors could still intercede to inhibit adherence. The intercession of contextual factors was individual to a woman and her life, meaning any particular contextual factor had inconsistent influences on PFMT adherence over time for individual women and exerted varying influences across different women. Long term adherence to PFMT is a complex interaction between many different factors. Enquiring about an individual woman's motivation to seek treatment and understanding the contextual factors that affect an individual woman will enable a practitioner to support longer-term adherence.
