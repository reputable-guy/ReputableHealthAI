Study Title: Effectiveness of a theory-underpinning exercise intervention among community-dwelling (pre)frail older adults: A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-underpinning exercise intervention among Chinese community-dwelling (pre)frail older adults, and the impacts of intervening late as opposed to intervening early. This was a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial. Participants were enrolled from six communities in a county of central China from January to November in 2021 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;149). A 12-week exercise intervention based on the integration of Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior and Health Action Process Approach was implemented among 149 community-dwelling (pre)frail older adults during the study period. The primary outcomes were frailty and muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Secondary outcomes included physical disability, fear of falling, cognitive function, depressive symptoms, social support and quality of life. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 12, 24 and 36&#xa0;weeks. A multilevel regression model was used for statistical analysis. The positive effects were statistically significant on frailty (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.166, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.016), muscle mass (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.499, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005), handgrip strength (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;14.758, p < 0.001), physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery, &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;6.043, p < 0.001), physical disability (Activities of Daily Living: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.462, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.043; Instrumental Activities of Daily Living: &#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.693, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.049;) and fear of falling (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.490, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003), cognitive function (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.466, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.011), depressive symptoms (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.541, p < 0.001), social support (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;27.661, p < 0.001), physical (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.413, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013) and mental (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.837, p < 0.001) components of quality of life at 0-week postintervention, and most of them persisted at 12- and 24-week postintervention. The effectiveness significantly differed by the time of interventions on muscle mass (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.217, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002), 5-time chair stand test (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.172, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.018), cognitive function (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.600, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014) and mental component of quality of life (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-12.679, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). The theory-underpinning exercise intervention has positive immediate and persistent effects on frailty, frailty-related characteristics as well as physical, mental and social functioning among Chinese community-dwelling (pre)frail older adults. Late intervention attenuated the significant intervention effect. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2100041981.
