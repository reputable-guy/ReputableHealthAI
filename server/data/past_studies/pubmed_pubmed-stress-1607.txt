Study Title: The effect of music on pain, anxiety and satisfaction during nonstress testing.

Study Summary:
To determine the effect of instrumental music played during Nonstress Test (NST) on pain, anxiety and satisfaction. This research was planned as randomised controlled. The sample of the study consists of 64 pregnant women. In data collection, a survey form containing socio-demographic characteristics, State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Evgeny Grinko-Valse piece were used as music. Among the groups where music was applied, satisfaction with the procedure was significantly high (X: 12.666, p: 0.049). No significant difference was detected between anxiety and pain conditions (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The scale scores of the groups before and after the procedure were evaluated; Before the procedure, significant differences were detected between the groups in terms of trait anxiety and fear of pain. As a result of the evaluation made after the procedure, there are significant differences between state anxiety and fear of pain (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). It was determined that music played during the NST procedure reduced state and trait anxiety. Satisfaction levels are also higher among the group that is listened to music. A successful pregnancy is important for the health of mother and baby. Reducing anxiety and stress, especially during the examinations, ensures that the process continues successfully. It is recommended that music played during pregnancy examinations and screening tests be used in clinics and during the procedure to increase satisfaction and reduce anxiety.
