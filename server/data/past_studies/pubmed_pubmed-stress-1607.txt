Study Title: Clinical Observation of Acupuncture Combined with Biofeedback Electrical Stimulation in the Treatment of Female Stress Urinary Incontinence.

Study Summary:
To investigate the clinical efficacy of acupuncture combined with biofeedback electrical stimulation on female stress urinary incontinence. Ninety patients diagnosed in a hospital between January 2020 and January 2021 were randomly divided into three groups (A, B and C). Group A was treated with biofeedback electrical stimulation, 3 times a week for 30&#xa0;min for 15 times. Group B used acupuncture treatment, including Guanyuan, Qihai, Zhongji, Zusanli, Sanyinjiao and Yinlingquan, once a day, Monday-Friday, 30&#xa0;min each, for a total of 10 times. Group C was treated with acupuncture combined with biofeedback electrical stimulation. All three groups were combined with pelvic floor muscle training. Following treatment, the changes in class I and II muscle fibre strength, ICI-Q-SF score and urine leakage in the 1-hour pad test were compared. Prior to treatment, there was no significant difference in the general data of the three patient groups, as well as class I and II muscle fibre strength, ICI-Q-SF score and 1-hour urinary pad test (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). Following treatment, class I and II muscle fibre strength in groups A and C improved compared with before, with statistical significance (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05); there was no significant difference in group B (P&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). In the three groups, ICI-Q-SF scores and 1-hour urinary pad test results were lower compared with before (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), with those in group C better than those in groups A and B (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The treatment efficiency of the three patient groups was 86.7%, 83.3% and 96.7%, respectively. Combined acupuncture and biofeedback electrical stimulation can improve pelvic floor muscle strength, urine leakage and quality of life, and can be superior to biofeedback and acupuncture treatment alone.
