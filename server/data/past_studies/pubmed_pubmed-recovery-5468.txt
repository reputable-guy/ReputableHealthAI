Study Title: Clinical application research of intelligent monitoring system for knee rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigates the effectiveness of a self-developed intelligent monitoring system for home-based knee rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In this randomized controlled trial, 120 patients undergoing TKA were divided using random digit allocation. Preoperative and one-month postoperative assessments of knee function, quality of life, and isometric knee extension strength were conducted with the Intelligent Monitoring System. Patients received group-specific rehabilitation instructions pre-discharge and performed exercises for one month. Changes in isometric knee extensor strength on the affected side within one month post-surgery for the brace-monitored rehabilitation group showed a significant decrease three days after surgery compared to one day before surgery. Subsequent measurements taken at postoperative days 5, 7, 14, and 21 indicated a gradual increase in strength, although these increases did not reach statistical significance when compared with previous measurements. One month post-surgery, all groups demonstrated significant improvements in knee joint function and mobility compared to pre-surgery levels. Notably, the brace-monitored group showed statistically significant improvements in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores over the conventional rehabilitation group. The Intelligent Monitoring System provides effective real-time monitoring and guidance for home-based knee rehabilitation post-TKA. It significantly enhances knee joint function, isometric knee extension strength, and quality of life shortly after surgery compared to traditional rehabilitation methods. This system offers a promising approach for improving postoperative recovery in TKA patients. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (Ethics Approval Number 202209008-2). It was registered with the China Clinical Trial Registry, a primary registry of the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (Registration Number ChiCTR2300068852).
