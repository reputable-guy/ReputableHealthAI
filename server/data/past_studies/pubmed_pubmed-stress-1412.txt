Study Title: Acute stress and blockade of mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptors: Effects on working memory.

Study Summary:
Although early studies were able to demonstrate a negative impact of stress on working memory performance, present research findings are heterogeneous. Numerous further studies found no effects or even improved performance, with the direction of these stress effects likely depending on the underlying biological mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate receptor-specific effects, as part of the stress-induced cortisol response, on working memory performance. Healthy, male participants (N=318, mean age 25.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.1y) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a social-evaluative stress manipulation, or a non-stress control condition after they had received either spironolactone (blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor, MR) or mifepristone (blockade of the glucocorticoid receptor, GR) or a placebo. Both substances are potent antagonists with high affinity for the respective receptors. To assess working memory, we implemented the n-back task subsequent to stress exposure, number of correct responses and reaction times served as outcome measures. We did not find effects of stress on working memory for any outcome measure, i.e. correct responses and reaction times. Yet, post hoc tests revealed that the group that received mifepristone exhibited longer reaction times under medium load conditions when compared to the placebo group, which might be an indication of the GR's involvement in task performance. We conclude that working memory performance is not affected by acute stress, at least under these prevalent conditions.
