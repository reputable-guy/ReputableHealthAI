Study Title: The application of the PDCA cycle in the nutritional management of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Study Summary:
This study is to explore the effect of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle on the nutritional management of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A total of 100 NPC patients were randomly divided into a control group and a PDCA group, with 50 patients in each group. The control group adopted a routine nutritional management strategy, and the PDCA group adopted a PDCA cycle management strategy. The body weight, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin, serum prealbumin, serum albumin, the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score, the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score, the incidence rate of nutritional risk, the grade of malnutrition, and the grade of oral mucositis were compared between the two groups. The body weight, BMI, and serum prealbumin in the PDCA group were higher than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The NRS2002 score and PG-SGA score in the PDCA group were lower than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The incidence of nutritional risk, the grade of malnutrition, and the grade of oral mucositis were less in the PDCA group than those in the control group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). There was no significant difference in hemoglobin and serum albumin between the two groups (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The PDCA cycle can improve body weight, BMI, and serum prealbumin in NPC patients. It can reduce the NRS2002 score, the PG-SGA score, the incidence of nutritional risk, the severity of malnutrition, and the severity of oral mucositis in NPC patients.
