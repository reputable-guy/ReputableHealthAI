Study Title: Effects of combined intervention of physical exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function in stroke survivors with vascular cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study evaluated the possible effect of the combined intervention of physical exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function in stroke survivals with vascular cognitive impairment. A single-blind (investigator-blinded but not subject-blinded) randomized controlled trial. Medical Rehabilitation Center of Shanghai General Hospital, China. A total of 225 patients (mean age 64.59&#x2009;years, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.27) who exhibited vascular cognitive impairment were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the four groups: (1) physical exercise ( n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56; 50-minute session), (2) cognitive training ( n&#x2009;=&#x2009;57; 60-minute session), (3) combined intervention of physical exercise and cognitive training ( n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55; 50-minute session&#x2009;+&#x2009;60-minute session), or (4) control groups ( n&#x2009;=&#x2009;57; 45-minute session). All participants received training for 36 sessions, three days per week, for 12&#x2009;weeks. Measures were recorded at baseline, after the intervention and at a six-month follow-up. Primary measurements included the Trail Making Part B, Stroop, forward digit span, and mental rotation tests. A total of 179 participants (79.56% response rate) completed the study. Cognitive performances on all four tasks in the combined training group improved significantly after the intervention ( P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). Changes in cognitive performance were greater in the combined intervention group than those in the physical exercise group (e.g. forward digit span, 13.61% vs. 2.18%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), the cognitive training group (e.g. mental rotation, 17.36% vs. 0.87%, P&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.002), and the control group (e.g. Stroop, -4.11% vs. -0.72%, P&#x2009; =&#x2009;0.026). The combined intervention produced greater benefits on cognitive function compared to either training alone in stroke survivors with vascular cognitive impairment.
