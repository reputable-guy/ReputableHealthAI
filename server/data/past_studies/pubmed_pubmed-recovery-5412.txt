Study Title: Comparison of Therapeutic Effect of Apheresis Platelets and Buffy Coat-Derived Platelet Concentrates.

Study Summary:
The study aimed to investigate the difference in clinical efficacy between apheresis platelets and buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates infusion in patients with hematological diseases. A total of 218 patients with hematological diseases were enrolled in Xi'an Central Hospital, from January 2023 to October 2023, and randomly divided into two groups: 109 patients were treated with apheresis platelet transfusion (AP group) and 109 patients with buffy coat derived platelet concentrates (BC-PC group). Platelet counts were measured before and 24 hours after transfusion, and the corrected platelet ascending number (CCI) and platelet recovery rate (PPR) were calculated. The clinical efficacy and blood transfusion reaction were observed. After 24 hours of platelet transfusion, there was no significant difference in the platelet count between the AP and BC-PC groups (p > 0.05). However, CCI and PPR significantly differed between the two groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the incidence of transfusion reaction in the AP group was significantly lower than in the BC-PC group. The clinical efficacy of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates is lower than that of apheresis platelets, but it can also improve the patient's condition and quality of life. Therefore, clinicians could rationally use BC-PC, according to the actual situation of the patients.
