Study Title: Application of enhanced recovery after surgery for oral dryness prevention after endoscopic sinus surgery.

Study Summary:
To investigate the efficacy of cluster nursing intervention based on Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for xerostomia in chronic rhinosinusitis after nasal endoscopic surgery. A total of 80 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who underwent functional nasal endoscopic surgery between January 2020 and December 2021 were selected and randomly divided into a control group (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;40) and an experimental group (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;40). Patients in the control group were treated with general nursing, while ERAS-based cluster nursing intervention was adopted for the experimental group, in addition to general nursing. Xerostomia stage and comfort level were observed at 2&#x202f;h, 6&#x202f;h, 24&#x202f;h and 48&#x202f;h after surgery; negative emotions before and after nursing were also observed. After the intervention, the xerostomia stage and comfort level at 6, 24 and 48 after surgery were higher in the experimental group (p&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.05). Negative emotions in the experimental group were lower after nursing (p&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.001). The self-rating depression scale and self-rating anxiety scale scores increased after nursing in both two groups (p&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.05). Enhanced recovery after surgery-based cluster nursing intervention can alleviate xerostomia, improve patients' comfort levels, reduce their negative emotions and accelerate postoperative recovery.
