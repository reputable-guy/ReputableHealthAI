Study Title: The influence of prehabilitation in patients with liver cirrhosis before liver transplantation: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The high prevalence of liver cirrhosis in Slovakia leads to a great need for transplant treatment. The outcome of liver transplantation is influenced by several factors. The main objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of prehabilitation compared to standard of care. Prospective, double-arm, randomized, open-registry study. Patient in F. D. Roosevelt Teaching Hospital, Slovakia, Bansk&#xe1; Bystrica. The participants consisted of patients with liver cirrhosis (55 men, 25 women). The patients were randomized to the active prehabilitation group (N.=39) or the standard of care group (SOC) (N.=41). SOC represents the standard of care for patients prior to liver transplantation, consisting of a formal oral interview lasting 30 minutes. In addition to SOC, each patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis also underwent a prehabilitation intervention that included rehabilitation and nutrition support. Patients completed the exercises under the supervision of a physician during hospitalisation. After one month, the liver frailty index improved in the prehabilitation group (P=0.05). No improvement in MELD (Model of End Stage Liver Disease) was found in the group that underwent the prehabilitation program (P=0.28), and no improvement was found in the Child-Pugh score after one month (P=0.13). In the prehabilitation groups compared with the SOC group, differences were not found in the MELD score (P=0.11). Better clinical outcomes according to the Child-Pugh score was found for the prehabilitation group compared with the SOC group (P=0.02). According to LFI, there was no difference between the groups (P=0.26). Very low adherence was found after three months. Only three patients in the SOC group and six patients in the prehabilitation group came to the check-up. Due to low adherence after 3 months in patients with liver cirrhosis, it is not possible to make an adequate comparison between groups after three months. Despite the great effort to maintain adherence, it was not possible to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of prehabilitation in patients before liver transplantation compared to standard of care because the main problem in Slovak patients with liver cirrhosis is low adherence. More studies are needed to identify the barriers that lead to low adherence in patients with liver cirrhosis. A promising result was found due to improvement of the Liver Frailty Index and the Child-Pugh Score after one month in the prehabilitation group.
