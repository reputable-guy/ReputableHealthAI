Study Title: Developing Self-Compassion in Healthcare Professionals Utilising a Brief Online Intervention: A Randomised Waitlist Control Trial.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: The level of stress experienced by staff in the healthcare sector is highly prevalent and well documented. Self-compassion may support the health and wellbeing of individuals and enable them to stay well at work. This study aimed to understand whether a brief, online, self-guided, novel intervention improved the health and wellbeing of healthcare professionals. (2) Methods: In a parallel randomised controlled trial, a volunteer sample of healthcare professionals were assigned to an intervention group (= 110) or a waitlist control group (= 80). Measures of self-compassion, mental wellbeing, stress and burnout were collected by an online questionnaire at baseline, post-programme and, for the intervention group, at follow-up. (3) Results: This intervention appeared to be effective in increasing self-compassion and mental health and decreasing stress and burnout. Significant group effects and significant time &#xd7; group interactions for overall self-compassion [F (2, 183) = 32.72,< 0.001; effect size &#x3b7;= 0.226], mental wellbeing [F (2, 212) = 17.46,< 0.001; effect size &#x3b7;= 0.135], perceived stress [F (2, 205) = 5.42,= 0.006; effect size &#x3b7;= 0.46], personal burnout [F (2, 224) = 7.57,= 0.001; effect size &#x3b7;= 0.063] and work burnout [F (2, 208) = 7.39,= 0.001; effect size &#x3b7;= 0.062] were found. (4) Conclusions: This study shows promise that an affordable and scalable intervention can be effective for busy healthcare professionals operating in a significantly challenging environment.
