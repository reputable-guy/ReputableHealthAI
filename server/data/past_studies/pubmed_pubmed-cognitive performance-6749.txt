Study Title: Cognitive Training Therapy Improves the Effect of Hypocaloric Treatment on Subjects with Overweight/Obesity: A Randomised Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Obesity has been associated with impaired cognitive performance. This study aimed to determine whether improvements in cognitive function may contribute to higher weight loss in patients with obesity. In this randomised, 12-week trial, participants with overweight/obesity were randomised into a cognitive training intervention (Cognitive) group or a cognitive-behavioural (Control) group. In addition, both groups followed a hypocaloric dietary treatment. Cognitive functioning measurements and anthropometrical parameters were evaluated. All cognitive measures improved in the intervention group (< 0.005 in all contrasts). In controls, significant improvements in attention, flexibility and task planning were also observed. Regarding anthropometrical parameters, the effect of the intervention in the cognitive group was higher for the total percentage of weight loss, body mass index (BMI), body fat and waist circumference. Biochemical parameters improved in both groups. Attending to our data, cognitive training was more effective that the hypocaloric intervention alone, partly related to an improvement in the working memory. Despite the shortage of training interventions for executive functions in the context of weight control, this type of combined intervention could establish the first steps towards a more appropriate intervention for patients with obesity.
