Study Title: A randomized feasibility study of a positive psychology journaling intervention to support recovery from substance-use disorders.

Study Summary:
Individuals in early recovery face significant biopsychosocial stressors causing a preponderance of negative affect. Novel interventions are needed to improve mood and well-being to support recovery. Positive Recovery Journaling (PRJ) combines elements of positive psychology, behavioral activation, and journaling to emphasize what is going right and to encourage small, positive steps that align with an individual's values to make life in recovery more rewarding and therefore more reinforcing. Our objective was to determine PRJ's feasibility, acceptability, and impact on a set of strengths-based, multidimensional aspects of recovery, including satisfaction with life, happiness with recovery, and commitment to sobriety. The study randomized adults in substance-use disorder treatment (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;81) to PRJ or control. Those in PRJ were asked to practice PRJ daily and complete online surveys for four weeks; those in the control group completed online surveys for four weeks. We used multi-level modelling to determine intercept and slope for feasibility and acceptability outcomes as well as to compare differences in recovery indicators between treatment and control at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 8. We conducted intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses for each recovery indicator. Participants were 53&#xa0;% female, and 26&#xa0;% Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and mean age of 39&#xa0;years. PRJ participants attended 71&#xa0;% of groups and completed 56&#xa0;% of the daily PRJ entries. Treatment and control groups rated their study tasks (PRJ for the treatment group, surveys for the control group) as equally easy; however, the PRJ group rated PRJ as significantly more satisfying, helpful, and pleasant. Treatment and control were not significantly different on any recovery indicator. In post hoc analyses, we found that for those with <90&#xa0;days sobriety at baseline (51&#xa0;%), PRJ had a statistically significant beneficial effect for satisfaction with life, happiness with recovery, and numerous secondary recovery indicators. Results suggest a positive impact of PRJ on numerous recovery indices for those in earliest recovery. Integrating PRJ into support services among those with <90&#xa0;days sobriety could reinforce what is going well in recovery to encourage its continued maintenance and thereby improve treatment outcomes.
