Study Title: Effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on disease acceptance for breast cancer patients: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Breast cancer patients face significant psychological challenges, including difficulties in accepting the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term impact of the disease. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has shown promise in enhancing acceptance and psychological flexibility in various populations. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of ACT in promoting disease acceptance among breast cancer patients through a randomized controlled trial. This study will recruit 90 breast cancer patients and randomly allocate them to an ACT intervention or control group. The ACT intervention, focusing on acceptance, mindfulness, value clarification, and committed action, will be delivered over 4 weeks. Meanwhile, the control group will receive standard care with non-therapeutic intervention. The study's primary outcome is disease acceptance, while secondary outcomes include depression, anxiety, social support, quality of life (QoL), and psychological inflexibility. Data will be collected at three points: baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. Statistical analysis will compare outcomes between groups to evaluate the effectiveness and mechanism of this intervention using covariance and mediation analysis. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ACT in promoting disease acceptance among breast cancer patients. It hypothesizes that the ACT group will show higher disease acceptance and improvements in social support, QoL, and psychological flexibility compared to the control group. The findings will contribute to research on psychological interventions and demonstrate ACT's effectiveness in enhancing disease acceptance. The research project is registered in the ClinicalTrials (NCT05327153).
