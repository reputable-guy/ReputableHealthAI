Study Title: [A prospective comparative study on effectiveness of single versus continuous adductor canal block combined with local infiltration anesthesia in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty].

Study Summary:
To compare the early analgesic effects and the impact on knee joint function recovery after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) between single adductor canal block (SACB) and continuous adductor canal block (CACB) combined with local infiltration anesthesia (LIA) using a prospective study. The patients with knee osteoarthritis admitted between April 2022 and December 2023 were enrolled as a subject. Among them, 60 patients met the selection criteria and were enrolled in the study. They were randomly assigned to the SACB group or CACB group in a ratio of 1:1 using a random number table method. There was no significant difference between the two groups (>0.05) in terms of age, gender, height, body mass, body mass index, affected side, and preoperative resting visual analogue scale (VAS) score and active VAS score, Oxford knee score (OKS), and American Hospital of Special Surgery (HSS) score. All patients received multimodal analgesia management using LIA combined with SACB or CACB. The operation time, pain related indicators (resting and activity VAS scores, number and timing of breakthrough pain, opioid consumption), joint function related indicators (quadriceps muscle strength, knee range of motion, OKS score, and HSS score), as well as postoperative block complications and adverse events were recorded and compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the operation time between the two groups (<0.05). All patients in the two groups were followed up with a follow-up time of (9.70&#xb1;4.93) months in the SACB group and (12.23&#xb1;5.05) months in the CACB group, and the difference was not significant (>0.05). The CACB group had a significant lower resting VAS score at 24 hours after operation compared to the SACB group (<0.05). There was no significant difference in resting and active VAS scores between the two groups at other time points (>0.05). The CACB group had a significantly lower incidence of breakthrough pain compared to the SACB group [9 cases (30.00%). 17 cases (56.67%);<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the timing of breakthrough pain occurrence and opioid consumption between the two groups (>0.05). Four cases in the SACB group and 7 cases in the CACB group experienced adverse events, with no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups (>0.05). The CACB group had significantly better knee joint mobility than the SACB group at 1 and 2 days after operation (<0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in knee joint mobility on 0 day after operation and quadriceps muscle strength and OKS and HSS scores at different time points (>0.05). In UKA, the analgesic effects and knee joint function recovery are similar when compared between LIA combined with SACB and LIA combined with CACB. However, SACB is simpler to perform and can avoid adverse events such as catheter displacement and dislocation. Therefore, SACB may be a better choice.
