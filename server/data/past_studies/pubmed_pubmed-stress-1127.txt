Study Title: Shedding light on maternal mental health in LMICs: a cornerstone of maternal and child health care.

Study Summary:
Maternal and Child Health (MCH) programs have long been integral to global public health initiatives, aiming to safeguard the well-being of both mothers and their offspring. However, amidst the comprehensive approach to physical health, the mental well-being of mothers has often been overlooked, representing a critical gap in these programs. This paper examines the importance of addressing maternal mental health within the framework of MCH programs, highlighting its significance and the repercussions of its neglect. Despite its profound impact on maternal and child outcomes, issues such as postpartum depression, anxiety, and maternal stress are frequently disregarded in MCH interventions. This oversight not only undermines the holistic nature of maternal health but also perpetuates cycles of poor mental health within families and communities. Herewith, an effort was made to highlight the importance of maternal mental health and the need to focus and strengthen awareness about it through policy and programs.
