Study Title: The 50% and 95% effective dose of remimazolam tosilate for anaesthesia induction in sleep disorders patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy: an up-and-down sequential allocation trial.

Study Summary:
Previous reports argue that preoperative sleep conditions of patients can influence the dosage of general anaesthesia drugs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the dose-effect relationship of preoperative sleep disorders on the induction of general anaesthesia with remimazolam tosilate and calculate the Median effective (ED50) and 95% effective (ED95) dosages. Included in our study were 56 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our hospital. A separate group of 27 patients with sleep disorders (SD group) and 29 patients without sleep disorders (NSD group) using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were also included. According to the Dixon 'up-and-down' design, patients received remimazolam at preselected concentrations starting at 0.2&#xa0;mg/kg. After the administration of remimazolam, loss of consciousness was observed. By observing whether consciousness disappeared within a minute, we adjusted the dose of remimazolam by 0.1&#xa0;mg/kg (up and down) in the following patient. The Median effective dose (ED50), 95% effective dose (ED95), and 95% confidence interval (CI) of remimazolam for effective sedation were calculated. The ED50 of remimazolam was 0.226&#xa0;mg/kg (95%CI 0.221-0.232&#xa0;mg/kg) in the SD group and 0.191&#xa0;mg/kg (95%CI, 0.183-0.199&#xa0;mg/kg) in the NSD group. The ED95 of remimazolam was 0.237&#xa0;mg/kg (95%CI 0.231-0.262&#xa0;mg/kg) in the SD group and 0.209&#xa0;mg/kg (95%CI 0.200-0.254&#xa0;mg/kg) in the NSD group. In the SD group, the ED50 and ED95 of remimazolam during anaesthesia induction were 0.226 and 0.237&#xa0;mg/kg, respectively. The induction dose of remimazolam in the SD group was significantly higher than that in the NSD group.
