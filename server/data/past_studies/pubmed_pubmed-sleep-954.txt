Study Title: The effect of visual feedback-based clinical monitoring application in patients with chronic low back pain: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
No study has addressed the effect of patient-reported outcomes as a visual feedback tool during telerehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a visual feedback-based monitoring application PhysioAnalyst on pain, pain catastrophizing, physical functions, quality of life, usability, satisfaction, and exercise adherence in individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP). A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 44 CLBP patients. Participants were randomized into two groups: the tele-assessment feedback group (TAFG) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) and the control group (CG) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22). Participants were assessed before the intervention, at the 4th week and after the intervention. Individuals were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ), Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ), and Exercise Adaptation Rating Scale (EARS) via PhysioAnalyst. Individuals in the TAFG group received graph-based visual feedback on assessment data in week 4. The improvement in VAS, NHP, ODI, TUQ, TSQ, and EARS of individuals in TAFG was statistically significant (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Only ODI and PCS scores in CG showed significant improvement (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). After the graphics-based visual feedback presented to the TAFG, the VAS, NHP-Emotional, NHP-Sleep, NHP-Total, PCS, TUQ, TSQ, ODI, and EARS scores gained more than CG (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The results confirmed the additional contribution of telerehabilitation's graphics-based visual feedback in pain, pain catastrophizing, disability, quality of life, and exercise participation. Since the importance of continuity in long-term rehabilitation in patients with CLBP is comprehended, feedback to increase patient motivation can be added to telerehabilitation applications.
