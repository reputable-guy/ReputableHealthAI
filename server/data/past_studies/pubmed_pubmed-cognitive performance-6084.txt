Study Title: Short-term Aronia melanocarpa extract supplementation improves cognitive performance: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study in healthy young adults.

Study Summary:
Evidence on the potential beneficial effects of anthocyanin-rich foods and supplements on cognitive performance is mainly based on acute or long-term studies in older adults. However, short-term studies focusing on a younger population are lacking. Therefore, short-term effects of Aronia melanocarpa extract (AME) supplementation on cognitive performance were investigated in healthy young adults. Potential underlying mechanisms were also addressed. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study was performed involving 35 apparently healthy young adults. Participants consumed AME (180&#xa0;mg anthocyanins/day) or a placebo for 1&#xa0;week, separated by at least 2&#xa0;weeks of wash-out. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Furthermore, arterial stiffness (carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity), retinal microvascular calibers (fundus photography), and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations were measured at baseline and after 1&#xa0;week. Participants had a mean age of 25&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4&#xa0;years and an average BMI of 23.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.7&#xa0;kg/m. Compliance was excellent and the study product was well-tolerated. As compared to placebo, movement time was significantly reduced by 4.8% within the five-choice reaction time test after 1&#xa0;week of AME supplementation (intervention effect: -&#xa0;12&#xa0;ms; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Memory and executive function did however not change. Serum BDNF concentrations were significantly higher after AME supplementation as compared to placebo (+&#x2009;5.7%; intervention effect: 1.8&#xa0;ng/mL; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). However, arterial stiffness and retinal microvascular calibers were not affected. Short-term AME supplementation beneficially affected cognitive performance as attention and psychomotor speed improved. Serum BDNF concentrations were increased, but vascular function markers were not affected. The study was registered on Clinical Trials under NCT03793777 on January 4th, 2019.
