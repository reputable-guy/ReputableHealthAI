Study Title: The effect of circadian timing program for evening-chronotype individuals with obesity on obesity management and sleep quality: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The study aimed to investigate the effect of the circadian timing program (S&#x130;ZAP) developed for evening-chronotype individuals with obesity on obesity management and sleep quality. This single-site, randomized controlled trial with an experimental research design was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. It was reported in accordance with the "Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials" (CONSORT) randomized controlled trial guidelines. The study sample consisted of 38 evening-chronotype individuals with first-degree obesity, with 19 individuals in each study group. The intervention group's sleep hygiene training was conducted and their lifestyle changes were ensured through S&#x130;ZAP. The control group followed their normal daily lifestyle. No intervention was made in terms of the dietary practices of both groups. Study data were collected using the personal information form, the anthropometric measurement form, the Horne and Ostberg Morning and Evening Questionnaire (MEQ), the Impact of weight on quality of life-lite (IWQOL-lite), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the sleep diary, and the data tracked via the website and smart bracelets. It was determined that the participants in the S&#x130;ZAP group had a statistically significant decrease in the anthropometric measurements and daytime sleepiness (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The sleep quality scores and the scores of the bodily functions sub-dimension of the quality of life scale were significantly better in the intervention group than in the control group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). It was found that S&#x130;ZAP is effective in obesity management in evening-chronotype individuals and increases weight loss success and sleep quality.
