Study Title: Knee Arthroscopic Surgery in Middle-Aged Patients With Meniscal Symptoms: A 10-Year Follow-up of a Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Short- and midterm evaluations of arthroscopic meniscal surgery have shown little or no effect in favor of surgery, although long-term effects, including radiographic changes, are unknown. To compare the 10-year outcomes in middle-aged patients with meniscal symptoms between a group that received an exercise program alone and a group that received knee arthroscopy in addition to the exercise program with respect to the prevalence of radiographic and symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA), patient-reported outcomes, and clinical status. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Of 179 eligible patients aged 45 to 64 years, 150 were randomized to undergo either 3 months of exercise therapy (nonsurgery group) or knee arthroscopy in addition to the exercise therapy (surgery group). Surgery usually consisted of partial meniscectomy (n = 56) or diagnostic arthroscopy (n = 8). Radiographs were assessed according to the Kellgren-Lawrence score at the baseline and 5- and 10-year follow-ups. Patient-reported outcome measures were reported at the baseline and 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year follow-ups. Clinical status was assessed at a 10-year follow-up. The primary outcomes were radiographic OA and changes in the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain subscale (KOOS) from the baseline to the 10-year follow-up. The primary analysis was performed using the intention-to-treat approach. At the time of the 10-year follow-up, eight patients had died, leaving 142 eligible patients. Radiographic OA was assessed for 95 patients (67%), questionnaires were answered by 110 (77%), and the clinical status was evaluated for 95 (67%). Radiographic OA was present in 67% of the patients in each group (&#x2265; .999); symptomatic OA was present in 47% of the nonsurgery group and 57% of the surgery group (= .301). There were no differences between groups regarding changes from baseline to 10 years in any of the KOOS subscales. Knee arthroscopic surgery, in most cases consisting of partial meniscectomy or diagnostic arthroscopy, in addition to exercise therapy in middle-aged patients with meniscal symptoms, did not increase the rates of radiographic or symptomatic OA and resulted in similar patient-reported outcomes at the 10-year follow-up compared with exercise therapy alone. Considering the short-term benefit and no long-term harm from knee arthroscopic surgery, the treatment may be recommended when first-line treatment-including exercise therapy for &#x2265;3 months-does not relieve patient's symptoms.
