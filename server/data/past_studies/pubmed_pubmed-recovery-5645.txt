Study Title: Hydromorphone combined with ropivacaine for erector spinae plane block in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy: A prospective randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Combining hydromorphone with ropivacaine in ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane blocks enhances postoperative analgesia and reduces interleukin-6 expression in breast surgery patients. In this study, breast cancer patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy were randomized into 3 groups for anesthesia (30 patients in each group): standard general (group C), Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) with ropivacaine (group R), and ESPB with ropivacaine plus hydromorphone (group HR). Diagnosis: Breast cancer patients. Postsurgery, pain levels, IL-6, anesthetic doses, additional analgesia needs, and recovery milestones were compared to evaluate the efficacy of the ESPB enhancements. The 3 groups were not significantly different in baseline characteristics, operation time, number of cases with postoperative nausea, and serum IL-6 concentrations at T1 (the time of being returned to the ward after surgery). At T2 (at 6:00 in the next morning after surgery), the serum IL-6 concentration in group HR was significantly lower than that in groups R and C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); the intraoperative doses of remifentanil, sufentanil, and propofol were significantly lower in groups HR and R than those in group C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); Groups HR and R had significantly lower visual analog scale scores at T3 (4 hours postoperatively), T4 (12 hours postoperatively), and T5 (24 hours postoperatively) than those in group C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); the proportions of patients receiving postoperative remedial analgesia were significantly lower in groups HR and R than in group C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); groups HR and R had significantly lower proportions of patients with postoperative nausea than group C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05); the time to the first anal exhaust and the time to the first ambulation after surgery were significantly shorter in groups HR and R than those in group C (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Hydromorphone combined with ropivacaine for ESPB achieved a greater postoperative analgesic effect for patients receiving MRM under general anesthesia. The combined analgesia caused fewer adverse reactions and inhibited the expression level of the inflammatory factor IL-6 more effectively, thereby facilitating postoperative recovery. ESPB using hydromorphone with ropivacaine improved pain control post-MRM, reduced adverse effects, and more effectively suppressed IL-6, enhancing recovery.
