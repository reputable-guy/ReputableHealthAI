Study Title: Real-world study on the application of enhanced recovery after surgery protocol in video-assisted thoracoscopic day surgery for pulmonary nodule resection.

Study Summary:
This study aims to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of applying different levels of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines to video-assisted thoracic day surgery (VATS). The goal is to determine the optimal degree of ERAS protocols and management requirements to improve postoperative recovery outcomes. It was designed as a single-centre, prospective pragmatic randomized controlled trial (PRCT), including patients who underwent VATS at the Day Surgery Center of West China Hospital, between January 2021 and November 2022. Patients were divided into Group A and Group B through convenience sampling to implement different levels of ERAS management protocols. Data collection included the baseline characteristics (gender, age, marital status, education level, BMI, PONV risk score, ASA classification), surgery-related indicators (type of surgery, pathological results, hospitalization costs, duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative rehydration volume), postoperative recovery indicators (postoperative chest tube duration time, time to first postoperative ambulation and urination, postoperative complications, follow-up condition), pain-related indicators (pain threshold score, pain score at 6&#xa0;h postoperatively, bedtime, and predischarge), psychological state indicators (anxiety level), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) scores, and social support scores. Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized and statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.4.1. Comparisons of categorical variables were performed using the &#x3c7;&#xb2; test, while comparisons of continuous variables were conducted using ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test. A significance level of &#x3b1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05 was set for statistical tests. A total of 340 patients were included, with 187 in Group A and 153 in Group B. After propensity score matching (PSM), there were 142 patients in Group A and 105 in Group B, with no significant baseline differences. Group A had a significantly higher proportion of chest tube removals within 24&#xa0;h postoperatively (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and earlier mobilization (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Despite a higher pain threshold in Group A (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016), their postoperative pain scores were not higher than those in Group B. Additionally, Group A had a lower incidence of postoperative complications. The more comprehensive ERAS protocol significantly improved postoperative recovery, confirming its value in day-case VATS and supporting its clinical adoption. However, the study has limitations; future research should focus on standardizing ERAS protocols and expanding their application to a broader patient population to validate these findings further. This study underwent review by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University under No. 2020 (1001). It has been officially registered with the China Clinical Trial Registry, TRN: ChiCTR2100051372 and registration date is Sept. 22, 2021.
