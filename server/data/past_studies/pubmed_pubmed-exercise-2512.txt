Study Title: The effect of music therapy and breathing exercise on anxiety and pain in patients undergoing coronary angiography: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
For over 50&#x2009;years, music therapy and breathing exercises have been widely utilized as interventions to help individuals cope with fatigue, stress and pain globally. To analyse the effects of music and breathing exercises on anxiety and pain in patients undergoing coronary angiography. This is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The sample comprised 165 patients: 55 in the control group, 55 in the breathing exercise group and 55 in the music therapy group. Patients in the music group listened to music during angiography, those in the breathing exercise group practised exercises 30&#x2009;min before the procedure and the control group received standard treatment. Anxiety levels were assessed before and after the procedure, and pain levels were measured post-procedure. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist for reporting randomized trials was used to guide reporting. Anxiety scores rose significantly in the control group from 33.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.2 pre-angiography to 37.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.9 post-angiography. Conversely, the breathing group's anxiety scores decreased from 34.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.5 before angiography to 31.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5 after angiography, and the music group exhibited a reduction from 32.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.6 to 30.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.6. Post-angiography, the control group reported a mean pain score of 64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.8&#x2009;mm, while the breathing and music groups had significantly lower scores of 35&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6 and 29&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.8&#x2009;mm, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant difference in pain scores between the intervention and control groups. This study provides support for the beneficial effects of employing breathing exercises and music in alleviating pain and anxiety during coronary angiography procedures. Integrating these findings into clinical practice could be significant for improving patients' pain experiences and anxiety, enhancing the tolerance of invasive medical procedures.
