Study Title: Comparison of Paladai Cup Against Nifty Cup Feeding in Preterm Low-Birth-Weight Infants: An Open-Labeled Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Neonatal Intuitive Feeding Technology (NIFTY) cup feeding has been found to be feasible in preterm low-birth-weight babies. However, literature on direct comparison of the same with paladai feeding is lacking.In this open-labeled, randomized controlled trial, preterm infants (<34 weeks/<1800 g) on full oral gastric tube feeding for at least 3 consecutive days, eligible to be given a trial of suck and swallow cup feeding, prior to initiation of direct breastfeeding, were randomized to the two feeding intervention groups: paladai cup and Nifty cup. The primary outcome was the time taken from initiation of oral cup feeds to reaching complete gavage-free cup feeds for at least 24 hours. Secondary outcomes were the ease of use of both instruments, the adverse effects during and within 10 minutes after feeding, and anthropometric parameters (head circumference and weight gain).The median (IQR) time taken from initiation to complete transition to full cup feeding for at least 24 hours was not significantly different [4(3,7) days in Nifty cup group versus 3(2,6) days in paladai cup group,= 0.25]. Mean &#xb1; SD weight gain from intervention to discharge was also similar in both the groups (16 &#xb1; 6 g/kg/day in Nifty cup group versus 17 &#xb1; 5 g/kg/day in paladai cup group,= 0.18). Adverse events did not differ (32.9% in group A versus 27.1% in group B,= 0.580). Nurses did not find any difference in ease of teaching caregivers [median (IQR) Nifty cup group 4(4,5) versus paladai cup group 4(4,5),= 0.13].The efficacy and adverse event rates were similar between Nifty cup feeding and paladai cup feeding in preterm infants. Both feeding modalities can be used prior to transition to direct breastfeeding in preterm low-birth-weight infants.
