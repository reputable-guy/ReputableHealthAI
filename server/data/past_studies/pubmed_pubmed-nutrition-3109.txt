Study Title: The Beneficial Effects of Regular Intake ofOLL2716 on Gastric Discomfort in Healthy Adults: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
We investigated the effects ofOLL2716 on gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy adults with gastric complaints. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 174 healthy Japanese adults were randomly assigned to an OLL2716 or placebo group, and each group consumed 85 g of yogurt containingOLL2716 or placebo yogurt daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in gastric symptoms from baseline as per the participants' questionnaires at 6 and 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in the short-form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI), the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and the Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire-Japanese (CNAQ-J) scores at 6 and 12 weeks. The primary endpoint data showed that the changes in "epigastric pain" at 6 and 12 weeks were significantly decreased in the OLL2716 group compared with those in the placebo group. Additionally, the changes in "epigastric pain syndrome-like symptoms" were significantly decreased in the OLL2716 group compared with those in the placebo group at 6 weeks. The SF-NDI items that improved at 6 weeks were "irritable, tense, or frustrated", "enjoyment of eating or drinking", and "tension", which are sub-scales related to mental stress. The items "Over-all" in the GSRS and "feeling hungry" in the CNAQ-J significantly improved in the OLL2716 group compared with the placebo group at 12 weeks. The results suggest that regular intake ofOLL2716 may improve both gastric discomfort and mental stress in healthy adults with gastric complaints, such as postprandial fullness or early satiety.
