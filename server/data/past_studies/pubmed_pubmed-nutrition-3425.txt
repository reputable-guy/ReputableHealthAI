Study Title: Impact of exercise training and diet therapy on the physical fitness, quality of life, and immune response of people living with HIV/AIDS: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Exercise and dietary nutrition are considered crucial in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment protocols and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) rehabilitation care. However, there is no well-studied research evaluating the effects of combined interventions on the fitness and immune systems of PLWHA. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the effects of exercise and dietary intervention on physical fitness, quality of life and immune response in PLWHA. This was an experimental study, with a sample of 25 male PLWHA divided into two groups: the intervention group (IG: 12 participants) and the control group (CG: 13 participants). All participants have not had any exercise habits and nutritional supplements in the past six months. The participants in the IG completed 45&#xa0;min of exercise (60-80% HRmax) 4 times per week for 4 weeks. The exercise was in the form of brisk walking or running. They were also given a nutritional dietary supplement 3 times a day for 4 weeks. The 13 individuals in the CG continued their normal daily life (physical activity and diet). The following parameters were evaluated before and after the intervention: body composition, physical fitness, immune response, quality of life (QoL), stress, dietary behavior, dietary habits, exercise motivation, and physical self-efficacy. The significant changes were observed in burnout of stress variables and physical efficiency index (PEI) of physical fitness in the IG (p&#x2009;=.023). Moreover, in the saliva samples, sal-T levels significantly increased only after the intervention in the IG (p&#x2009;=.012). Additionally, regarding the analysis of the interaction (group &#xd7; time), there was a significant improvement in the reaction speed (p&#x2009;=.001) and grip strength (left: p&#x2009;=.002, right: p&#x2009;=.030) and a significant difference in physical satisfaction in QoL (p&#x2009;=.001), stress burnout (p&#x2009;=.043), self-confidence in physical efficacy (p&#x2009;=.045), external display (p&#x2009;=.008), and fulfillment (p&#x2009;=.047) in exercise motivation. Moreover, the significant effect of the intervention on emotional eating in dietary behavior was shown in the comparison of the IG before and after intervention (p&#x2009;=.001) and in the comparison of the IG group with the CG after the experiment (p&#x2009;=.013). However, there was no significant effect of time or interaction between the condition and time on body composition. In conclusion, exercise training and diet therapy caused changes in physical fitness and Sal-T levels, which had positive effects on the health promotion of PLWHA.
