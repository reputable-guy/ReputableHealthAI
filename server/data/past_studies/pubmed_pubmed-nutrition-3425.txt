Study Title: Does intradialytic oral nutrition impact hemodialysis patients' quality of life, appetite, and safety? A pilot study of a crossover clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Introduction: due to the catabolic characteristics of hemodialysis (HD), patients should consume foods or supplements during this treatment to meet their energy requirements and maintain a neutral nitrogen balance; however, there are some outcomes in which the effect of intradialytic oral nutrition (ION) is scarcely known. Objectives: this study aims to evaluate the effect of two types of ION (liquid and solid) on Quality of Life (QoL), appetite, and safety in HD patients. Methods: a pilot randomized, crossover clinical trial was performed in 18 patients on chronic HD. One group received ION for 18 HD sessions, after the crossover continued for 18 more sessions in the control group, and vice versa. We recorded QoL, appetite, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and intradialytic hypotension (IH) events. Results: clinical improvement was observed for most QoL components. Regardless of the consistency of supplementation, SBP increased to 4.10 mmHg. Both study groups reported a "very good-to-good" appetite. Conclusion: favorable clinical changes were observed in QoL scores during the study. Five of six IH events were reported for patients in the ION group, and SBP increased within the safe range (&#x2264; 10 mmHg); appetite remained stable in both groups. Therefore, we concluded that this strategy, regardless of implementation consistency, is safe to be used in stable patients.
