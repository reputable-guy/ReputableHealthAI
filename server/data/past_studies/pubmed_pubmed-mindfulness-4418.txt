Study Title: CAREGIVER Randomized Trial of Two Mindfulness Methods to Improve the Burden and Distress of Caring for Persons with Cirrhosis.

Study Summary:
Patient caregivers experience burden and distress that negatively impacts health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Mindfulness may alleviate caregiver burden but randomized trials of mindfulness activities on caregiver burden and distress are lacking. Caregivers for patients with advanced liver disease were recruited from the Universities of Michigan and Pennsylvania (12/2019-12/2021) and followed for 8&#xa0;weeks. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to: written emotional disclosure for 4&#xa0;weeks, resilience training for 4&#xa0;weeks, or control (no active intervention). All completed assessments at baseline, week 4 and 8. The primary outcome was change in the Zarit Caregiver Burden Index-12 (ZBI) at week 8. Secondary outcomes included changes at week 4 and 8 in the ZBI, distress thermometer (DT), HRQOL visual analog scale (VAS), and caregiver captivity index (CCI). Eighty seven caregivers were enrolled, 59(72%) completed the study. In unadjusted analyses at week 4, the burden measured by ZBI was not significantly different between arms, increasing by 0.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.7 and 2.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.2 points, for the written emotional disclosure and resilience training study arms, respectively, and by 2.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.1 points in the control arm. At week 8, the non-significant ZBI change was - 1.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.9, 2.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.1, and 1.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.4 for written emotional disclosure, resilience training, at week 8, respectively. The DT and VAS worsened in all arms, however, it worsened the least in the written emotional disclosure arm. In analyses adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics, the ZBI declined by - 4.21&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.03(p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) in the emotional disclosure arm at week 4. This decrease was attenuated week 8, - 1.13&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.6(p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.67). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes save for resilience training reducing the CCI at week 4 by 1.36&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.67(p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Written emotional disclosure may reduce caregiver burden in the short term among caregivers for patients with cirrhosis. NCT04205396.
