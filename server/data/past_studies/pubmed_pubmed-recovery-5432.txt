Study Title: Effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with intelligent Gait-Adaptability Training in improving lower limb function and brain symmetry after subacute stroke: a preliminary study.

Study Summary:
Persistent lower limb dysfunction is a major challenge in post-stroke recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is recognized for addressing post-stroke motor deficits. Our study explores the efficacy of combining rTMS with gait-adaptive training to enhance lower limb function and regulatory mechanisms in subacute stroke. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 27 patients with subacute hemiparesis, dividing them into experimental and control groups. Both groups underwent gait-adaptability training 5 times/week for 4 weeks, with the experimental group receiving daily low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation before training. Primary outcomes included the pairwise derived brain symmetry index, lower-extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment, 10-meter walk test, and Berg Balance Scale. Assessments occurred before and after the four-week intervention. The experimental and control groups showed significant improvements in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, 10-meter walk test, and Berg Balance Scale after the 4-week intervention compared to baseline (all p<0.05). However, the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvements compared to the control group in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (p=0.024) and the 10-meter walk test (p=0.033). Additionally, the experimental group exhibited a more pronounced decrease in the pairwise derived brain symmetry index (p=0.026) compared to the control group. Within the experimental group, the cortical subgroup's pairwise derived brain symmetry index was significantly lower than that of the control group (p=0.006). Combining low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation with Gait-Adaptive Training effectively enhances lower limb function and Regulatory mechanisms of the cerebral hemisphere in subacute stroke recovery, and it can provide rapid and effective rehabilitation effect compared with gait adaptation training alone.
