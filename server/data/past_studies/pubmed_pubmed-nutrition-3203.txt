Study Title: Psychometric Properties of a Wellness Behavior Rating Scale for Young Adolescents.

Study Summary:
We examined the psychometric properties of the(PANT) survey, developed by researchers to track weight management behaviors among youth. Data from 2,039 middle school students (age = 12.4,= .5; 51.4% girls) were analyzed to explore and then confirm the factor structure of the PANT survey. We also examined the bivariate associations between the PANT survey, body mass index (BMI), and the Progressive Aerobic Cardiorespiratory Endurance Run (PACER). Results suggest that the PANT survey is comprised of two factors-and-each with adequate internal consistency (= .79 and 0.86, respectively). The Physical Activity subscale appears to be significantly associated with both-BMI (= -0.10,< .001) and the PACER (= 0.33,< .001) in the anticipated directions, but the criterion validity of the Healthy Choices subscale is less clear. We discuss these findings and explore future directions for developing meaningful self-report wellness behavior scales for youth.
