Study Title: The relationship between postural control and cognitive functioning following Zumba dancing in middle-aged women: A randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12-week Zumba dancing on postural control and cognitive parameters and the correlations between these parameters in middle-aged women. Thirty-eight women, aged between 50 and 60&#x2009;years, were randomly allocated to a Zumba group (ZG) or control group. Postural control and cognitive functions [working memory (WM) and reaction time (RT)] were assessed before and after 12&#x2009;weeks of a Zumba dancing program using a stabilometric force platform, Corsi Block-Tapping Task and Simple RT tests, respectively. The results indicate that ZG showed significantly (p<.01) better balance performances when standing on a stable surface in both visual conditions [firm surface with eyes opened (EO) (20,9%) and eyes closed (EC) (12.3%)]. However, when standing on an unstable surface in both visual conditions (foam surface with EO/EC), the ZG showed no significant improvement in postural control. It seems that the benefits of Zumba on postural control depend on the sensory condition. Besides, 12-week Zumba dancing was not sufficient to significantly enhance cognitive performances (RT/WM) performances. These cognitive performances were related to postural control in challenging conditions and can be considered an effective tool for monitoring postural performances following an intervention program. Clinicians should, therefore, focus on interventions that boost cognitive functions in middle-aged women to achieve optimal postural control, mainly in challenging conditions, in order to prevent the risk and fear of falls as well as the incidence of falling.
