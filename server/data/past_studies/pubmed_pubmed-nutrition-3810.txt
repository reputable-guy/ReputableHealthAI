Study Title: Effects of Polydextrose Supplementation on Intestinal Function in Hemodialysis Patients: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Intestinal constipation is a frequent complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Polydextrose (PDX), a nondigestible oligosaccharide, has been reported as a fermentable fiber with potential benefits. This study aimed to investigate the possible influence of PDX supplementation on intestinal function in HD patients. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 28 patients who received daily oral supplementation with 12&#xa0;g of PDX or placebo (corn starch) for 2&#xa0;months. ROME IV criteria were used to define constipation and questionnaires were applied to patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) and their impact on the patient assessment of constipation quality of life. The Bristol scale was used to assess stool consistency. Commercial Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay kits were used to evaluate the interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; plasma levels. 25 patients completed the study; 16 in the PDX group [7 females, 48.5&#xa0;years (IQR&#xa0;=&#xa0;15.5)] and 9 in the control group [3 females, 44.0&#xa0;years (IQR&#xa0;=&#xa0;6.0)]. According to ROME IV criteria, 55% of patients were diagnosed with constipation. PAC-SYM faecal symptoms domain was reduced after 2&#xa0;months of PDX supplementation (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.004). We also observed a significant reduction in the PAC-QoL-concerns domain (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.02). The average values for PAC-SYM and patient assessment of constipation quality of lifewere reduced significantly after intervention with PDX. There were no significant changes after the intervention period concerning biochemical variables, food intake, and inflammation markers. No adverse effects were observed during the supplementation period. The results of the present study suggest that short-term PDX supplementation may have favourable results on intestinal function and the quality of life of chronic kidney disease patients in HD.
