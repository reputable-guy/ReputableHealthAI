Study Title: Depression and&#xa0;Differential Oral Health Status Among U.S. Adults With and&#xa0;Without Prior Active Duty Service in&#xa0;the U.S. Military, National Health and&#xa0;Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2018.

Study Summary:
Veterans suffer from lower overall well-being than non-veterans because of their unique life course. This study aims to compare the impact of depression on oral health for veteran and non-veteran populations. Data from 11,693 adults (18+) participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2018) were analyzed. The outcome variables were dichotomous (at/above mean) decayed, missing, and filled teeth due to caries (DMFT), as well as the components, namely, missing teeth, filled teeth (FT), and decayed teeth (DT). The primary predictor variable combined depression screening outcome and veteran status (veteran/depressed, veteran/not depressed, non-veteran/depressed, and non-veteran/not depressed). Covariates included socioeconomic factors, demographics, wellness factors, and oral health-related habits. Associations between outcome and predictor variables were assessed with a fully adjusted logistic regression analysis. Veterans, regardless of depression status, had more DMFT, FT, missing teeth, and DT compared to non-veterans. After controlling for covariates, veterans suffering from depression had higher odds of DT (1.5, 95% CI, 1.0-2.4) compared to non-veterans without depression. In general, veterans who screened negative for depression had better oral health compared to all groups, with lower odds of DT (0.7, 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) and higher odds of FT (1.4, 95% CI, 1.1-1.7) compared to non-veterans with and without depression. This study found that not only veterans have higher odds of overall caries experience, but also veterans suffering from depression have higher odds of active caries compared to non-depressed veterans. Most veterans lack Veterans Health Administration dental benefits and face challenges maintaining oral health on top of medical and mental health burdens. Our results add further urgency to increasing dental care access for this vulnerable population because of the exacerbation of unmet oral health care needs attributable to the additional mental health challenges veterans face.
