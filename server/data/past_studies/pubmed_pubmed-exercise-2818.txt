Study Title: Aerobic Exercise in the Aquatic Environment Suppresses the Plasma Renin Activity in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
To compare the acute effects of aquatic walking/running versus dry-land walking/running on blood glucose and plasma renin activity (PRA) in individuals with type 2 diabetes, participants with type 2 diabetes performed deep-water or dry-land walking and/or running sessions in a swimming pool or on an athletics track, respectively. Both sessions comprised seven blocks of 3 min at 85-90% of the heart rate deflection point (HRDP), interspersed with 2 min at <85% HRDP, totaling 35 min, with a 48 h interval between sessions. PRA and blood glucose were assessed before and immediately after the sessions. Generalized estimation equations were used to verify the session effects, with the Bonferroni post hoc test, considering the significance level as 0.05. Twelve individuals (53.2 &#xb1; 8.9 years) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for 6.3 &#xb1; 6.34 years participated in the study. A reduction in PRA was found only after the aquatic session (-7.75 ng/mL/h; -69%;: 0.034), while both aquatic and dry-land sessions similarly reduced the blood glucose levels (aquatic: -38 mg/dL, -21%; dry-land: -26 mg/dL, -14%; time effect,= 0.007). Despite yielding similar glycemic reductions as dry-land walking/running, aquatic walking/running led to an expressive decrease in PRA among individuals with type 2 diabetes.
