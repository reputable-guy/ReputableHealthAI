Study Title: Videogame training increases clinical well-being, attention and hippocampal-prefrontal functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia.

Study Summary:
Recent research shows that videogame training enhances neuronal plasticity and cognitive improvements in healthy individuals. As patients with schizophrenia exhibit reduced neuronal plasticity linked to cognitive deficits and symptoms, we investigated whether videogame-related cognitive improvements and plasticity changes extend to this population. In a training study, patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls were randomly assigned to 3D or 2D platformer videogame training or E-book reading (active control) for 8 weeks, 30&#x2009;min daily. After training, both videogame conditions showed significant increases in sustained attention compared to the control condition, correlated with increased functional connectivity in a hippocampal-prefrontal network. Notably, patients trained with videogames mostly improved in negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and perceived mental health recovery. Videogames, incorporating initiative, goal setting and gratification, offer a training approach closer to real life than current psychiatric treatments. Our results provide initial evidence that they may represent a possible adjunct therapeutic intervention for complex mental disorders.
