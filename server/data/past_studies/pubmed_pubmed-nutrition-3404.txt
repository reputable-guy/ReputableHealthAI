Study Title: Ju&#xe7;ara (Martius) improves time-to-exhaustion cycling performance and increased reduced glutathione: a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, and triple-blind study.

Study Summary:
To examine the effects of 7-days ju&#xe7;ara powder (JP) intake on oxidative stress biomarkers and endurance and sprint cycling performances. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, and triple-blind study, 20 male trained cyclists were assigned to intake 10&#xa0;g of JP (240&#xa0;mg anthocyanins) or placebo (PLA) for 7 days and performed a cycling time-to-exhaustion (TTE). A 5&#xa0;s cycling sprint was performed before and after the cycling TTE. Blood oxidative stress biomarkers and lactate concentration where evaluated 1&#xa0;h before (T-1), immediately after (T0), and 1&#xa0;h after (T1) the cycling TTE. The mean duration time for the cycling TTE was 8.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.0% (63&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;17&#xa0;s) longer in the JP condition (JP: 751&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;283&#xa0;s) compared to PLA (688&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;266&#xa0;s) (&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.019). Two-way repeated measures Analysis of variance showed an increase in the JP condition for reduced glutathione (GSH) (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.049) at T0 (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.039) and T1 (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.029) compared to PLA with a moderate effect size at T0 (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.61) and T1 (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.57). Blood lactate levels increased over time in both conditions (&#xa0;0.001). No differences were observed for the post-TTE sprint fatigue index, total phenols, protein carbonyls, and glutathione peroxidase activity. Seven-day intake of JP improved cycling endurance performance and increased GSH levels but had no effect on lactate and cycling sprint-induced fatigue.
