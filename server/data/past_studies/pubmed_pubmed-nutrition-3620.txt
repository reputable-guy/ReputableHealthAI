Study Title: Frailty-Preventing Effect of an Intervention Program Using a Novel Complete Nutritional "COMB-FP Meal": A Pilot Randomized Control Trial.

Study Summary:
Frailty is a huge concern for the aging population, and dietary nutrition is considered a key factor in the prevention of aging. To solve the problem of frailty in the aging population, we developed a novel dietary intervention program using a novel COMpletely Balanced for Frailty Prevention (COMB-FP) meal, based on the Dietary Reference Intake for Japanese; in addition, we conducted a pilot randomized control trial comparing an exercise program only (control group) with exercise plus the COMB-FP meal program (test group). We included 110 male and female healthy volunteers with pre-frailty or frailty; the trial lasted for 12 weeks. Two daily meals were replaced with the COMB-FP meals during the trial in the test group. Walking speed and cognitive function were significantly improved in the test group compared with the control group. We observed a similar pattern in other frailty-related outcomes, such as occupancy of the microbiome, World Health Organization well-being index (WHO-5), and oxidative stress. Our study might indicate the importance of a well-balanced intake of nutrients for frailty prevention.
