Study Title: Wellbeing Training Based on Contemplative Practices in a Sample of Intensive Care and Homecare Professionals: A Pilot and Feasibility Non-Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Intensive care unit (ICU) and homecare unit professionals are susceptible to higher levels of stress and burnout than other healthcare professionals, which has an impact on their well-being, and in turn on their patients. In terms of data, there is not much research about the effects of psychological interventions on ICU and homecare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Wellbeing Training based on Contemplative Practices (WTCP) for the increase of psychological functioning in a sample of ICU and homecare professionals. A pilot and feasibility non-randomized clinical trial was conducted. Participants in the WTCP group (= 19) attended an at-work 8-session/2 h group WTCP program aimed at directly training four basic skills: (a) sustained positive emotions, (b) recovery from negative emotions, (c) pro-social behavior and generosity, and (d) mind wandering, mindfulness, and "affective stickiness". Nineteen professionals were allocated in the control group. Results indicated that WTCP had a positive impact on self-compassion, personal accomplishment (burnout), and frequency of negative emotions. Moreover, a thematic analysis of participant interviews (= 14) was conducted. These preliminary results are promising, though future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of WTCP using randomized controlled trial methodologies.
