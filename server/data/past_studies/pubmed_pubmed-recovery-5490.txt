Study Title: [Impacts of different anesthetic protocols on the speed and quality of postoperative resuscitation in patients undergoing painless gastroscopy].

Study Summary:
To estimate the impacts of different anesthetic protocols on the speed and quality of postoperative resuscitation in patients undergoing painless gastroscopy.This was a prospectively designed randomized control study that included 150 patients who underwent painless gastroscopy in Hainan Cancer Hospital affiliated to Hainan Medical College between April and December of 2023. All the patients, classified as American Society of Aneshesiologists (ASA) Grade &#x2160; or &#x2161;, were randomly divided into three groups with different anesthetic protocols, including propofol group (group P), remimazolam group (group R) and remimazolam with flumazenil group (group RF). There were eventually 50 patients in each group. The three groups of patients were compared for their resuscitation time and the time that they stayed in the resuscitation room (addressed as"room time"below). At 10 min and 20 min after resuscitation, each patient was tested for recognition ability (orientation score), walking ability and fine motor skill (including reaction speed, quick-click ability and visual memory), respectively, with possible adverse reactions recorded spontaneously, such as hypotension, dizziness, nausea and vomitus.There were 29 males and 21 females in group P with an average age of (34&#xb1;6) years, 27 males and 23 females in group R with an average age of (36&#xb1;8) years, and 26 males and 24 females in group RF with an average age of (33&#xb1;7) years, respectively. All examinations for each patient were successfully completed with no interruptions. The resuscitation time and room time of group RF were (47&#xb1;15) s and (26&#xb1;5) min,respectively, which were both shorter than those in either group R [(489&#xb1;92) s and (35&#xb1;6) min] or group P [(196&#xb1;61) s and (31&#xb1;7) min] (all<0.05). The orientation score of patients in group RF at 10 min after resuscitation was (79.0&#xb1;10.5), which was significantly higher than that in group R (70.0&#xb1;11.7) (<0.05). The patients' walking ability score of group RF at 10 min and 20 min after resuscitation were [(23.6&#xb1;10.8), (48.0&#xb1;4.5)], which were better than those in group R[(15.4&#xb1;11.1), (47.6&#xb1;4.8)] (both<0.05). The patients' reaction speed and quick-click scores of group RF were [(851.0&#xb1;150.9), (547.0&#xb1;114.0) ms] and [(758.0&#xb1;73.2), (629.0&#xb1;128.9) ms], which were better than those in either group R [(1 151.0&#xb1;206.0), (732.0&#xb1;135.1) ms], [(893.0&#xb1;110.9), (765.8&#xb1;125.8) ms] or group P [(985.0&#xb1;225.3), (613.0&#xb1;123.2) ms], [(831.0&#xb1;87.7), (691.0&#xb1;115.8) ms] (all<0.05). The incidence rate of hypotension in group P was 18% (9/50), higher than that in either Group R [4% (2/50)] or group RF [2% (1/50)] (all<0.05). The incidence rates of dizziness, nausea and vomitus were comparable among all the three groups with no statistical differences (all>0.05).In patients undergoing anesthesia with remazolam, the use of flumazenil can not only shorten the resuscitation time and the time that the patients need to stay in the resuscitation room, but also speed up the recovery of the patients' recognition, walking and fine motor skill abilities.
