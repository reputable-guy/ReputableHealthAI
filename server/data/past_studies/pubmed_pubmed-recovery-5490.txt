Study Title: Evaluation of bite force after microplate and miniplate osteosynthesis for the management of undisplaced or minimally displaced anterior mandibular fractures: A clinical comparative study.

Study Summary:
Although the microplate system is commonly used for the treatment of maxillofacial fractures, its use in the fixation of mandibular fractures is not widely accepted. The study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of microplates and miniplates in osteosynthesis for the internal fixation of undisplaced and minimally displaced anterior mandibular fractures. A total of 40 patients diagnosed with undisplaced or minimally displaced symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures were randomly assigned to 2 study groups (group A and group B). Patients in group A (microplate group) were treated with two 0.8-mm microplates, whereas patients in group B (miniplate group) received two 2.0-mm miniplates. Bite force values were recorded in 30 healthy individuals (control group) to establish baseline values. Postoperative bite force values were recorded at various intervals and compared between the study groups and the control group. Both groups demonstrated a progressive improvement in the bite force. However, the bite force values recorded at the 2nd, 4th and 6th postoperative weeks were comparatively lower in the microplate group. At the six-week follow-up, the bite force values were lower in both study groups in comparison to the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of postoperative complications between the study groups. The use of microplates in the management of undisplaced or minimally displaced anterior mandibular fractures results in a reduction in the recovery of biting force in comparison to the conventional miniplate system.
