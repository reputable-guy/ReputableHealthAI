Study Title: Improving psychological well-being among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic with an online mindfulness intervention: A randomised waitlist-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The high prevalence of psychological problems observed among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic called for interventions to safeguard their mental health. We assessed the effectiveness of a 6-week online mindfulness-based intervention in improving well-being and reducing stress among HCWs in Sri Lanka. Eighty HCWs were recruited and randomised into two groups: waitlist-control (WLC) and intervention groups. In the intervention, 1-hour online sessions were conducted at weekly intervals and participants were encouraged to do daily home practice. Stress and well-being were measured pre- and post-intervention using the Perceived Stress Scale and WHO-5 Well-being Index, respectively. One-way analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effectiveness, in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and complete-case (CC) analyses. A significantly greater improvement in well-being occurred in the intervention arm compared to WLC on both ITT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002) and CC analyses (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001), with medium-to-large effect sizes (partial &#x3b7;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.117-.278). However, the reduction in stress following the intervention was not significant compared to the WLC group on both ITT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.636) and CC analyses (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.262). In the intervention arm, the median number of sessions attended by participants was 3. Low adherence to the intervention may have contributed to the apparent non-significant effect on stress.
