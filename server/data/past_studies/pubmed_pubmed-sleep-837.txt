Study Title: Effects of vitamin D and/or calcium intervention on sleep quality in individuals with prediabetes: a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation on sleep quality in individuals with prediabetes. A 24-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in a 212 Chinese population with prediabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to four groups: vitamin D&#x2009;+&#x2009;calcium group (1600&#xa0;IU/day&#x2009;+&#x2009;500&#xa0;mg/day, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;53), vitamin D group (1600&#xa0;IU/day, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;54), calcium group (500&#xa0;mg/day, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51), and control group (placebo, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;54). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used as the primary outcome to assess sleep quality. Questionnaires and fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and post-intervention for demographic assessment and correlation index analysis. After a 24-week intervention, a significant difference was observed in serum 25(OH)D concentration among the four groups (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), and the total PSQI score in vitamin D&#x2009;+&#x2009;calcium group was lower compared to the preintervention levels. Subgroup analyses revealed improved sleep quality with calcium supplementation (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) for specific groups, including women, individuals with a low baseline 25(OH)D level (<&#x2009;30&#xa0;ng/mL), and individuals in menopause. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the extent of change in sleep efficiency scores before and after the calcium intervention and the degree of change in insulin efficiency scores (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.264, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007), as well as the magnitude of change in islet beta cell function (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.304, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). The combined intervention of vitamin D and calcium, as well as calcium interventions alone, exhibits substantial potential for improving sleep quality in individuals with prediabetes. The trial was registered in August 2019 as ChiCTR190002487.
