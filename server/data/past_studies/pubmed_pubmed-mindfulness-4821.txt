Study Title: The role of trataka in ameliorating visual strain and promoting psychological well-being during prolonged use of digital displays: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The prolonged usage of digital displays leads to visual strain and, in turn, impairs psychological well-being. The practice of Yoga is said to enhance psychological functions and reduce visual strain. The present study assessed the effect of the trataka (Yogic visual concentration) practice on the visual strain, mind-wandering, and mindfulness. One hundred six volunteers equally distributed in the experimental and control groups completed the study. Visual Fatigue Scale (VFS), visual symptoms checklist (VSC), mind-wandering questionnaire (MWQ), and State Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (SMAAS) were administered at baseline and at the end of two weeks. All variables were similar at the baseline in both groups, and significant differences were noted at the end of two weeks between both groups. There was a significant reduction in VFS and VSC scores, MWQ, along with an increase in SMAAS scores in the experimental group. Although there were significant changes in VFS, MWQ, and SMAAS in the control group, the magnitude of change was minimal. The practice of trataka was found to reduce the visual strain, mind wandering while improving the state mindfulness. The practice can be implemented to mitigate visual strain and associated psychological implications due to prolonged exposure to digital displays, which has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
