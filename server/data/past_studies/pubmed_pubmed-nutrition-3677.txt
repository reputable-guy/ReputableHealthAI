Study Title: The PREDG study: A randomised controlled trial testing whether an educational intervention can prevent gestational weight gain in women with obesity.

Study Summary:
The PREDG trial was designed to study the influence of an educative program on gestational weight gain in women with pregestational obesity. Randomized controlled clinical trial (https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN61793947) in 169 women with pregestational obesity (BMI &#x2265;30&#xa0;kg/m). Women were randomized to participate in a group education program in nutrition and physical activity or conventional follow-up in a specialized Unit of Obesity and Pregnancy. The nutritional intervention was adjusted to prepregnancy BMI and to the physical activity intensity. Quality was based on the Mediterranean diet. Macronutrients were distributed as follows: 50% carbohydrates, 20% protein and 30% fat. Adequate gestational weight gain was defined between 5 and 9&#xa0;kg (IOM 2009). Mean gestational weight gain was compared between groups by using the T Student test and frequencies of adequate gestational weight gain were compared by using &#xa4eb;. Gestational weight gain was lower in the intervention group: 8 (4-11) vs 9.2 (6-13) kg, p 0.026. Gestational weight gain was below 9&#xa0;kg in 24 of 39 (61.5%) women of the intervention vs 10 of 41 (24.4%) of the control group (p 0.001). Regarding obstetric complications, there were 15 (8.3%) cases of gestational diabetes with no differences between the groups. There were 14 of 85 (18.2%) cases of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in the intervention group compared with 26 of 84 (32.5%) in the control group (p 0.040). With reference to neonatal weight, there were 7 of 82 (8.5%) large for gestational age neonates in the intervention group compared with 15 of 79 (19.2%) in the control group (p 0.050). A group-based educative and structured intervention results in an adequate weight gain and lower rates of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and large for gestational age neonates in pregnant women with obesity.
