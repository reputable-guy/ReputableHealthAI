Study Title: Healthy Change Intervention: A Cluster RCT in Preschooler Mothers in Mexico and the United States.

Study Summary:
To assess effects of Healthy Change intervention on maternal perception of her child's body weight (MPCW), maternal feeding style, and obesogenic home environment. A randomized control trial was conducted, consisting of two arms: the intervention group received the Healthy Change program, and the control group received the Hygiene and Accident Prevention program. A total of 356 mother-preschool child dyads participated, 182 in the intervention group and 174 in the control group, residing in Mexico and the United States. Data were collected at baseline and after the program through self-administered questionnaires completed by mothers and child anthropometric measurements. Although no significant between-group difference in pre- and post-intervention change of MPCW was found, sub-analyses revealed that a higher proportion of mothers in the intervention group accurately perceived their child's body weight at the study endpoint using categorical (67% vs. 57.1%, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.005) and visual scales (48.9% vs. 41.8%, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.015). Additionally, more mothers of overweight children in the intervention group accurately perceived their children's overweight and obese status compared to those in the control group (29.8% vs. 10.3%, X&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.26, df&#x2009;=&#x2009;1, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.039). The intervention group also displayed a higher proportion of mothers with authoritative feeding style (26.4% vs. 16.5%, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.036) and significantly higher family nutrition and physical activity scores (29.1 vs. 28.0, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.000) at the study endpoint. Healthy Change Intervention led to improved accuracy of MPCW, a shift toward maternal authoritative feeding styles, and positive changes in obesogenic home environments.
