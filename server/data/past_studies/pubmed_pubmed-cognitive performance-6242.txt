Study Title: Influence of mid-afternoon nap duration and sleep parameters on memory encoding, mood, processing speed, and vigilance.

Study Summary:
To determine how mid-afternoon naps of differing durations benefit memory encoding, vigilance, speed of processing (SOP), mood, and sleepiness; to evaluate if these benefits extend past 3 hr post-awakening and to examine how sleep macrostructure during naps modulate these benefits. Following short habitual sleep, 32 young adults underwent four experimental conditions in randomized order: wake; naps of 10 min, 30 min, and 60 min duration verified with polysomnography. A 10-min test battery was delivered at a pre-nap baseline, and at 5 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 240 min post-nap. Participants encoded pictures 90 min post-nap and were tested for recognition 210 min later. Naps ranging from 10 to 60 min increased positive mood and alleviated self-reported sleepiness up to 240 min post-nap. Compared to waking, only naps of 30 min improved memory encoding. Improvements in vigilance were moderate, and benefits for SOP were not observed. Sleep inertia was observed for the 30 min to 60 min naps but was resolved within 30 min after waking. We found no significant associations between sleep macrostructure and memory benefits. With short habitual sleep, naps ranging from 10 to 60 min had clear and lasting benefits for positive mood and self-reported sleepiness/alertness. Cognitive improvements were moderate, with only the 30 min nap showing benefits for memory encoding. While there is no clear "winning" nap duration, a 30 min nap appears to have the best trade-off between practicability and benefit.
