Study Title: Hydrogen-Rich Gas Enhanced Sprint-Interval Performance: Metabolomic Insights into Underlying Mechanisms.

Study Summary:
(1) Background: The diversity of blood biomarkers used to assess the metabolic mechanisms of hydrogen limits a comprehensive understanding of its effects on improving exercise performance. This study evaluated the impact of hydrogen-rich gas (HRG) on metabolites following sprint-interval exercise using metabolomics approaches, aiming to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. (2) Methods: Ten healthy adult males participated in the Wingate Sprint-interval test (SIT) following 60 min of HRG or placebo (air) inhalation. Venous blood samples were collected for metabolomic analysis both before and after gas inhalation and subsequent to completing the SIT. (3) Results: Compared with the placebo, HRG inhalation significantly improved mean power, fatigue index, and time to peak for the fourth sprint and significantly reduced the attenuation values of peak power, mean power, and time to peak between the first and fourth. Metabolomic analysis highlighted the significant upregulation of acetylcarnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine upon HRG inhalation, with enrichment pathway analysis suggesting that HRG may foster fat mobilization by enhancing coenzyme A synthesis, promoting glycerophospholipid metabolism, and suppressing insulin levels. (4) Conclusions: Inhaling HRG before an SIT enhances end-stage anaerobic sprint capabilities and mitigates fatigue. Metabolomic analysis suggests that HRG may enhance ATP recovery during interval stages by accelerating fat oxidation, providing increased energy replenishment for late-stage sprints.
