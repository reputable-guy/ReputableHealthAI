Study Title: Translating thyroid hormone into clinical practice: lessons learned from theanalysis on data available from the ThyRepair study.

Study Summary:
Thyroid hormone (TH) appears to have a reparative action on the postinfarcted myocardium. This novel action was recently tested in a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ThyRepair). The present study performed aanalysis of data from the ThyRepair study to provide further insights into the novel actions of TH on the human postischemic myocardium. Data from 41 patients participating in the ThyRepair study (n = 20 placebo and n = 21 LT3) were included in the analysis. LT3 treatment started after stenting and continued intravenously for 48&#xa0;h. All patients had cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at hospital discharge; left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF%), LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi; mL/m), LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVi; mL/m), infarct volume (IV), left ventricular mass index (LVMi) as edema index, and microvascular obstruction (MVO) were assessed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the median value of the IV: patients with IV &#x2264; 20% of the LV (group A) and patients with IV > 20% (group B). CMR measurements at discharge are expressed as mean &#xb1; SD. In group A, the placebo and T3-treated groups had similar LVEF% (56.8 &#xb1; 10.2 vs. 52.2 &#xb1; 10.5), LVEDVi (90.9 &#xb1; 19.8 vs. 92.8 &#xb1; 14.5), and LVESVi (40.8 &#xb1; 18.2 vs. 44.9 &#xb1; 14.1) at discharge. In group B, LVEDVi and LVESVi were 112 &#xb1; 23.8 and 68.3 &#xb1; 21.5 for placebo vs. 91.8 &#xb1; 18.6 and 49.0 &#xb1; 14.0 for the T3-treated group, respectively, p < 0.05. LVEF% was significantly increased in the T3-treated group vs. placebo, 47.3 &#xb1; 6.5 vs. 39.9 &#xb1; 8.7, p < 0.05. In group B, CMR LVMi was lower in T3-treated patients vs. placebo but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1). MVO was 1.95 &#xb1; 2.2 in placebo vs. 0.84 &#xb1; 0.9 in the LT3-treated group, p = 0.15. The present study suggests that acute LT3 treatment may exert more favorable effects on the recovery of cardiac function in patients with large infarct size. Furthermore, it signals a potential effect of LT3 on myocardial edema and microvascular obstruction. These novel findings merit further investigation in large trials.
