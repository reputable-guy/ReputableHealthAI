Study Title: The Application of Self-Made Disseminating and Descending Breathing Exercises in Home Rehabilitation of Stable COPD.

Study Summary:
To investigate the clinical effects and application value of self-made disseminating and descending breathing exercises on home rehabilitation of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Seeking to generate concepts for creating novel, convenient, and efficient COPD prognosis rehabilitation exercises aimed at enhancing the well-being and rehabilitation confidence of both COPD patients and their families. A total of 70 COPD patients admitted to our outpatient department from July 2019 to September 2021 were randomly divided into the exercise group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;35) and the control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;35). The control group received routine breathing training, while the exercise group was treated with self-made disseminating and descending breathing exercises. The respiratory function, including pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC) and respiratory muscle strength (MIP, MEP), exercise tolerance (6-min walking distance, 6MWT), Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC, Borg), COPD quality of life score (CAT, SGRQ), anxiety and depression scores (HAMA, HAMD) were compared between the two groups after 12-week exercise. After 12-week training, the FEV1, MIP, and MEP in the exercise group were significantly higher than those in the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001), and the 6MWT was significantly increased in the exercise group compared to the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001); while the mMRC, Borg score, the scores of CAT, SGRQ, HAMA, and HAMD were found significantly lower than those in the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). The self-made disseminating and descending breathing exercises can improve respiratory function and reduce symptoms of dyspnea in COPD patients, while enhancing exercise tolerance and relieving anxiety and depression, and are worthy of clinical application.
