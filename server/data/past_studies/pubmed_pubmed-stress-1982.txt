Data were collected by a demographic questionnaire, the Westside Test Anxiety Scale, and the Educational Stress Scale.After laughter yoga, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in test anxiety (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.859; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.005) and educational stress scores (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.52875; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) compared to the control group.Laughter yoga was associated with decreased test anxiety and educational stress.
