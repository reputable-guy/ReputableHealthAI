Study Title: Lessons from a crisis: occupational stress in healthcare workers in an acute paediatric teaching hospital in Ireland.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic placed increased pressure on service provision and healthcare worker (HCW) wellness. As the crisis of the pandemic receded, paediatric healthcare staff required an appropriate response to facilitate individual and organisational recovery, to minimise long-term HCW burn-out and to be better equipped for future crisis in paediatric healthcare. To explore the experiences of HCWs working during the COVID-19 pandemic in an acute paediatric hospital to determine an appropriate leadership response in the postcrisis work environment. Qualitative research design using responses from open-ended questions from 133 clinical and non-clinical staff (89% clinical) from an Irish paediatric teaching hospital. Responses were thematically analysed. Paediatric HCWs experienced frustration, uncertainty, anxiety and stress, during the pandemic crisis. Perceived organisational contributors included communication inconsistencies, inadequate support and resources, including staff shortages. This exposed remaining staff to high risk for long-term burn-out as the pandemic recedes. Three themes were developed detailing this: support, communication and trust. This research supports the long-standing need to increase mental health service investment and to implement an appropriate response to regain and maintain a healthy workforce, post-COVID-19. The organisational response should address the biopsychosocial needs of the individual and paediatric healthcare organisations should work dynamically, creatively and collaboratively to ensure the psychological safety of their workforce.
