Study Title: Acute aerobic exercise to recover from mental exhaustion - a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Prolonged periods of intense cognitive activity lead to a state of mental exhaustion. While widespread strategies to recover from mental exhaustion (i.e., watching TV) are non-effective, aerobic exercise seems to be a promising approach. This can be explained by the acute and chronic aerobic exercise-induced benefits on the central nervous system. This study investigated the potential of a single bout of moderate aerobic exercise (65-75% of each participants' individual V&#x2d9;O2peak) to recover from experimentally induced mental exhaustion. A randomized controlled trial on healthy adults (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;99) was conducted. They performed 60&#xa0;min of a cognitively demanding test battery, in order to induce mental exhaustion. Subsequently, they were randomized to one of three treatments: 30&#xa0;min of moderate aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer, 30&#xa0;min of a simple lower body stretching routine (= active control treatment) or watching a popular sitcom (= passive control treatment). Cognitive flexibility performance, mood, tiredness, restlessness, self-perceived cognitive capacity, and motivation were assessed before and after treatment. The empirical results showed that moderate aerobic exercise led to a better recovery for cognitive flexibility (mean difference divided by pooled standard deviation, Cohen's d=&#xa0;0.737), mood (d=&#xa0;0.405), tiredness (d=&#xa0;0.480), self-perceived cognitive capacity (d=&#xa0;0.214), and motivation (d=&#xa0;0.524) compared to active control treatment. Moderate aerobic exercise was also more effective than passive control treatment (d=&#xa0;0.102&#xa0;-&#xa0;0.286) with the exemption of tiredness (d=&#xa0;0.015) and restlessness (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.473). In conclusion, this study suggests that a single bout of acute aerobic exercise supports regeneration of cognitive flexibility performance and of subjective well-being. This holds true not just compared to artificial active control treatment but also compared to widespread leisure time activity, namely watching TV.
