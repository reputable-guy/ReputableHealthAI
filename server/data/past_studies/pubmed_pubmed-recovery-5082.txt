Study Title: Venetoclax plus D-CAG (decitabine, cytarabine, aclarubicin, G-CSF) for elderly or unfit patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia: a multicenter, prospective study.

Study Summary:
Induction regimens with satisfactory remission rates are limited for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are elderly or ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. This study is a single-arm, multicenter, prospective phase I/II study (registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR 2200059694 on May 8, 2022), aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax plus decitabine, cytarabine, aclarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (VD-CAG) for newly diagnosed AML patients who are elderly or ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was composite complete remission (CRc) after 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy. The secondary endpoints were measurable residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry and adverse events. Forty patients(n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) received 1 cycle of the VD-CAG regimen for induction chemotherapy. The median age of the patients was 64 (55-81) years, and 10 patients (25%) had secondary AML. Our results showed that 1 cycle of VD-CAG had a high overall response rate of 97.5% and CRc of 95%, and all 10 patients with secondary AML achieved CRc. Moreover, the patients who achieved CRc had deep remission, with MRD-negativity of 71.1% and 54.2% by flow cytometry and molecular assessment, respectively. In addition, blood cell recovery was quick, with a median time to absolute neutrophil count&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1.0&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10/L and platelet count&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;100&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10/L at 19 days and 15.5 days, respectively. In conclusion, VD-CAG demonstrates high efficacy as an induction treatment for elderly or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML, and it could be an alternative upfront therapy for this subpopulation, Trials with large-scale subjects are needed for further validation, especially for secondary AML.
