Study Title: Thermal and Cardiovascular Responses during Exertional Heat Stress after Diphenhydramine Use: A Randomized Crossover Trial.

Study Summary:
Despite sparse systematic evidence, current exercise heat safety recommendations suggest that antihistamines blunt sweating and increase the risk for heat-related injury during exertional heat stress. The primary purpose of the present study was to examine whether diphenhydramine hydrochloride (DPH), a first-generation antihistamine, affects the sweating, core temperature, and heart rate (HR) response during exertional heat stress using a double-blind randomized crossover design. On two occasions separated by >48 h, 20 healthy adults (10 females, 23 &#xb1; 3 yr, body surface area: 1.9 &#xb1; 0.2 m 2 , body mass index: 23.7 &#xb1; 2.2 kg&#xb7;m -2 ) orally consumed either 50 mg of DPH or placebo (PLA), and then rested for 2 h in a climate-controlled room maintained at 30&#xb0;C and 35% relative humidity (heat index of ~29&#xb0;C), followed by a 60-min fixed-heat production treadmill walk (6.3 &#xb1; 1.0 W&#xb7;kg -1 ). Whole-body sweat loss, local sweat rate, rectal temperature ( Trec ), and HR were measured. Whole-body sweat loss was not different between conditions (PLA: 406 &#xb1; 78 g, DPH: 396 &#xb1; 75 g; P = 0.26, treatment effect: -10 g; 95% confidence interval, -28 to 8). No differences were observed for the onset of sweating (PLA: 13.5 &#xb1; 2.4 min, DPH: 13.3 &#xb1; 2.7 min; P = 0.79) and steady-state local sweat rate (PLA: 0.83 &#xb1; 0.26 mg&#xb7;cm -2 &#xb7;min -1 , DPH: 0.82 &#xb1; 0.27 mg&#xb7;cm -2 &#xb7;min -1 ; P = 0.99). No difference in baseline Trec was observed (PLA: 37.09&#xb0;C &#xb1; 0.35&#xb0;C, DPH: 37.13&#xb0;C &#xb1; 0.33&#xb0;C; P = 0.68), and the 60-min &#x394; Trec was not different ( P = 0.99) between PLA (0.83&#xb0;C &#xb1; 0.29&#xb0;C) and DPH (0.81&#xb0;C &#xb1; 0.30&#xb0;C). HR was similar at baseline (PLA: 86 &#xb1; 13 bpm, DPH: 84 &#xb1; 11 bpm; P = 0.30) and end-exercise (PLA: 134 &#xb1; 28 bpm, DPH: 132 &#xb1; 26 bpm; P = 0.90). Fifty milligrams of DPH does not modify the sweating, core temperature, and HR response during exertional heat stress in young healthy adults.
