Study Title: Effect of ivabradine on structural and functional changes of myocardium and NT-proBNP levels in patients with stable coronary heart disease after coronary stenting.

Study Summary:
Aim: To investigate the effect of ivabradine on the hemodynamics and contractility of the myocardium and the features of NT-pro-BNP production in patients with stable ischemic heart disease after endovascular revascularization of the myocardium depending on the number of affected coronary arteries during 12 months of therapy. Materials and Methods: The object of the study was 120 patients with stable coronary artery disease: angina pectoris of functional class III with heart failure IIA FC III with preserved and moderately reduced ejection fraction of the left ventricle, who underwent coronary artery stenting. The examined patients were randomized according to the number of affected coronary vessels and the method of treatment. Results: Ivabradine in patients with stable ischemic heart disease after 12 months of therapy had a significant beneficial effect on the structural and functional parameters of the myocardium (contributed to the reverse remodeling of the left ventricle), which did not depend on the number of stented coronary arteries (p<0.05). In patients with stented one coronary artery, all structural and functional indicators of the heart after 12 months of treatment reached the values of practically healthy individuals from the control group. The use of ivabradine in patients with stable ischemic heart disease with heart failure with preserved and intermediate ejection fraction of the left ventricle after coronary stenting made it possible to ensure the correction of a number of clinical and pathogenetic links of the disease, which generally contributed to the improvement of metric and volumetric parameters of the heart. Conclusions: Ivabradine made it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of standard therapy, which was manifested by a faster recovery of the geometry and contractility of the left ventricle. Therefore, the use of ivabradine along with standard therapy was appropriate for such a contingent of patients. The management of patients with stable coronary heart disease should combine adequate (surgical and pharmacological) treatment of the underlying disease, further individual medication correction of symptoms and circulatory disorders inherent in coronary heart disease and heart failure.
