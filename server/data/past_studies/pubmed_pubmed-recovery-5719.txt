Study Title: An Innovative Study Focused on Reducing Unnecessary Oxygen Exposure in Pediatric Patients.

Study Summary:
In the perioperative period, fractional-inspired&#xa0;oxygen is used at values up to 80% to stay within the safe range, even for a short time. A clear value for the safe range has not been specified, and therefore, clinicians prefer a high oxygen value. This study aims to reduce unnecessary oxygen exposure in pediatrice patients and to provide the optimum fractional inspired oxygen value. The study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled study, including 139 patients aged 1 to 8 years without comorbidity. Three groups were formed by adjusting the fractional inspired oxygen to 30%, 50%, or 80% intraoperatively. In the intraoperative period, a strict inspired oxygen protocol (hypoxemia threshold was SpO<&#xa0;90) and oxygen reserve index, fractional expired oxygen value, and peripheral oxygen saturation were used to maintain the balance of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia. One hundred and nine children were included. The mean oxygen reserve index was significantly lower in the 30% group than in the other groups (0.09&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.05, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;.0001). The mean arterial pressure in the 30% group was significantly lower than the 80% group but within the normal range (78&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6&#xa0;mmHg, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;.003). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding delirium and pain in the recovery unit. Due to the known and unknown harmful effects of unnecessary oxygen exposure, it may be time to use optimal oxygen and to fear unnecessary oxygen, not less oxygen. As the next step, we think studies should be conducted with patient groups with lower oxygen concentrations (eg, %21 vs %24 vs %30), more patients, and arterial blood gas monitoring.
