Study Title: Twenty-Four-Hour Post-Thrombolysis NIHSS Score As the Strongest Prognostic Predictor After Acute Ischemic Stroke: ENCHANTED Study.

Study Summary:
This study was conducted to determine optimal predictive ability of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) measurements at baseline, 24&#x2009;hours, and change from baseline to 24&#x2009;hours after thrombolysis on functional recovery in patients with acute ischemic stroke who participated in the ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study). ENCHANTED was an international, multicenter, 2&#xd7;2 quasifactorial, prospective, randomized open trial of low-dose versus standard-dose intravenous alteplase and intensive versus guideline-recommended blood pressure lowering in thrombolysis-eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke. Absolute (baseline minus 24&#x2009;hours) and percentage (absolute change/baseline&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;100) changes in NIHSS scores were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses assessed performance of different NIHSS measurements on 90-day favorable functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-2) and excellent functional recovery (mRS score 0-1). Youden index was used to identify optimal predictor cutoff points. A total of 4410 patients in the ENCHANTED trial were enrolled. The 24-hour NIHSS score had the highest discriminative ability for predicting favorable 90-day functional recovery (mRS score 0-2; area under the curve 0.866 versus 0.755, 0.689, 0.764;<0.001) than baseline, absolute, and percentage change of NIHSS score, respectively. The optimal cutoff point of 24-hour NIHSS score for predicting favorable functional recovery was &#x2264;4 (sensitivity 66.5%, specificity 87.1%, adjusted odds ratio, 9.44 [95% CI, 7.77-11.48]). The 24-hour NIHSS score (&#x2264;3) was the best predictor of 90-day excellent functional recovery (mRS score 0-1). Findings were consistent across subgroups, including sex, race, baseline NIHSS score, stroke subtype, and age. In thrombolysis-eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke, 24-hour NIHSS score (optimal cutpoint of 4) is the strongest predictor of 90-day functional recovery over baseline and early change of NIHSS score.
