Study Title: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for adherence of immunosuppressive treatment in liver transplant recipients: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on the adherence of liver transplant recipients to immunosuppressive therapy with a randomized controlled design. This randomized controlled trial was performed with 120 liver transplant recipients hospitalized at the liver transplant department of a research and practice hospital (n = 120). While we administered no intervention to the patients in the control group (n = 60), we provided Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy to those in the experimental group (n = 60). We used the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and the Immunosuppressant Therapy Adherence Scale to collect data. We utilized descriptive statistics, paired-samples t-tests, independent-samples t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, and chi-squared tests to analyze the data. After the intervention, the immunosuppressive therapy adherence levels of the experimental group increased significantly (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the control group had significantly higher adherence to immunosuppressive therapy and significantly higher levels of mindfulness in the pretest phase than it did in the posttest phase (p < 0.01). Complete adherence to immunosuppressive therapy is imperative for the prevention of graft rejection in liver transplant recipients. In our study, the experimental group equipped with enhanced mindfulness had higher adherence to immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, the use of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in the promotion of adherence to immunosuppressive therapy is recommended.
