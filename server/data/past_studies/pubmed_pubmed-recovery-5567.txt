Study Title: Preoperative high dose of dexamethasone in emergency laparotomy: randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy present with a profound inflammatory response, which could be an independent pathophysiological component in prolonged recovery. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single preoperative high dose of intravenous dexamethasone on the inflammatory response and recovery after emergency laparotomy. In this double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, patients were prospectively stratified according to surgical pathology (intestinal obstruction and perforated viscus) and randomized to preoperative 1&#x2005;mg/kg dexamethasone or placebo at a ratio of 1 : 1. The primary outcome was C-reactive protein on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes were postoperative recovery, morbidity, and mortality. A total of 120 patients were included in the trial. On postoperative day 1, the C-reactive protein response was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group (a median of 170 versus 220&#x2005;mg/l for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; P = 0.015; mean difference = 49 (95% c.i. 13 to 85)&#x2005;mg/l) and when stratified according to intestinal obstruction (a median of 60 versus 160&#x2005;mg/l for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; P = 0.002) and perforated viscus (a median of 230 versus 285&#x2005;mg/l for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; P = 0.035). Dexamethasone administration was associated with improved recovery (better haemodynamics, better pulmonary function, less fatigue, and earlier mobilization). Furthermore, the dexamethasone group had a lower 90-day mortality rate (7% versus 23% for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; relative risk 0.33 (95% c.i. 0.11 to 0.93); P = 0.023) and a decreased incidence of postoperative major complications (27% versus 45% for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; relative risk 0.62 (95% c.i. 0.37 to 1.00); P = 0.032). A single preoperative high dose of intravenous dexamethasone significantly reduces the inflammatory response after emergency laparotomy and is associated with enhanced recovery and improved outcome.
