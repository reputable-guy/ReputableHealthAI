Study Title: A cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of the 'Caring for Providers to Improve Patient Experience' (CPIPE) intervention in Kenya and Ghana: study protocol.

Study Summary:
Poor person-centered maternal care (PCMC) contributes to high maternal mortality and morbidity, directly and indirectly, through lack of, delayed, inadequate, unnecessary, or harmful care. While evidence on poor PCMC prevalence, as well as inequities, expanded in the last decade, there is still a significant gap in evidence-based interventions to address PCMC. We describe the protocol for a trial to test the effectiveness of the "Caring for Providers to Improve Patient Experience" (CPIPE) intervention, which includes five strategies, targeting provider stress and bias as intermediate factors to improve PCMC and address inequities. The trial will assess the effect of CPIPE on PCMC, as well as on intermediate and distal outcomes, using a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial in 40 health facilities in Migori and Homa Bay Counties in Kenya and Upper East and Northeast Regions in Ghana. Twenty facilities in each country will be randomized to 10 intervention and 10 control sites. The primary intervention targets are all healthcare workers who provide maternal health services. The intervention impact will be assessed among healthcare workers in the study health facilities and among women who give birth in the study health facilities. The primary outcome is PCMC measured with the PCMC scale, via multiple cross-sectional surveys of mothers who gave birth in the preceding 12 weeks in study facilities at baseline (prior to the intervention), midline (6 months after intervention start), and endline (12 months post-baseline) (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;2000 across both countries at each time point). Additionally, 400 providers in the study facilities across both countries will be followed longitudinally at baseline, midline, and endline, to assess intermediate outcomes. The trial incorporates a mixed-methods design; survey data alongside in-depth interviews (IDIs) with healthcare facility leaders, providers, and mothers to qualitatively explore factors influencing the outcomes. Finally, we will collect process and cost data to assess intervention fidelity and cost-effectiveness. This trial will be the first to rigorously assess an intervention to improve PCMC that addresses both provider stress and bias and will advance the evidence base for interventions to improve PCMC and contribute to equity in maternal and neonatal health.
