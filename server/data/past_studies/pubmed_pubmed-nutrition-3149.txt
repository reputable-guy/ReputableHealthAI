Study Title: Anthropometric, Body Composition, and Nutritional Indicators with and without Nutritional Intervention during Nitisinone Therapy in Alkaptonuria.

Study Summary:
Protein nutrition disorder in alkaptonuria (AKU), resulting in increased homogentisic acid (HGA) before nitisinone therapy and increased tyrosine (TYR) during nitisinone therapy, may benefit from dietetic intervention. The aim of this study was to characterise the diet and their effects prospectively in those who received formal dietetic intervention in the nitisinone-receiving National Alkaptonuria Centre (NAC) patients with those who did not in no-nitisinone Suitability of Nitisinone in Alkaptonuria 2 (SN2 N-) and nitisinone-treated SN2 (SN2 N+) randomised study groups. A total of 63, 69, and 69 AKU patients from the NAC, SN2 N-, and SN2 N+ were studied for anthropometric (weight, BMI), body composition (including muscle mass, %body fat, hand grip strength), chemical characteristics (serum TYR, serum phenylalanine, urine urea or uUREA, and urine creatinine or uCREAT), and corneal keratopathy. Nitisinone 2 mg and 10 mg were employed in the NAC and SN2 N+ groups, respectively. Dieticians managed protein intake in the NAC, while the SN2 N- and SN2 N+ groups only received advice on self-directed protein restriction during four years of study duration. uUREA decreased in the NAC, SN2 N-, and SN2 N+ groups, showing that protein restriction was achieved in these groups. Body weight and BMI increased in the NAC and SN2 N+ groups. uCREAT decreased significantly in SN2 N- and SN2 N+ compared with the NAC over four years of study. Corneal keratopathy was less frequent in the NAC than in the SN2 N+ group. Active dietetic intervention in NAC stabilised lean body mass (muscle mass, hand grip strength) despite a decrease in uUREA and uCREAT, as well as sTYR. Ongoing dietetic intervention prevented loss of lean body mass despite protein restriction and moderated serum tyrosine increase, leading to less prevalent corneal keratopathy. Protein restriction risks fat mass gain.
