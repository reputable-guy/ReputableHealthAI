Study Title: The Best Start Trial: A randomised controlled trial of ultra-early parent-administered physiotherapy for infants at high risk of cerebral palsy or motor delay.

Study Summary:
It is unknown whether ultra-early physiotherapy commenced during neonatal intensive care unit admission is of value for optimising developmental outcomes in preterm/term infants at high-risk of cerebral palsy or motor-delay. To determine whether ultra-early parent-administered physiotherapy to preterm/term high- risk infants commenced at earliest from 34-weeks post menstrual age, improves motor outcomes at 16-weeks corrected age (CA) compared to usual care. Single-blind randomised controlled pilot study with 30 infant participants. The primary outcome was the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) total score at 16-weeks CA. Secondary outcomes included (i) parent Depression Anxiety and Stress Score and Parent Perceptions Survey at 16-weeks CA; and (ii) Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 12-months CA. There were no clinically worthwhile effects at 16-weeks CA on the AIMS (mean between-group difference, 95% CI: -0.2, -2.4 to 2.0) or most secondary outcomes. However, the parents' "perception of treatment effectiveness" and "perception of change" favoured the experimental group. In this pilot trial, there was no clinically worthwhile effect of ultra-early parent-administered physiotherapy over usual care on the AIMS. However, the intervention was feasible for infants, acceptable to parents and parents perceived a benefit of treatment. Whilst this trial did not demonstrate treatment effectiveness using the AIMS, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample size, the low responsivity of the AIMS to change in motor performance and the heterogeneity of the participants. Therefore, the intervention should not be abandoned on the basis of this trial, but rather further evaluated in a larger trial that addresses some of the learnings from this one.
