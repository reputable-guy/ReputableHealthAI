Study Title: An online delivered running and walking group program to support low-active post-secondary students' well-being and exercise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic: a pilot randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a social identity-informed, online delivered, running and walking group program to support low-active post-secondary students' exercise behavior and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. A two-arm, non-blinded, parallel pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted whereby low-active post-secondary students at a Canadian university were equally randomized to an online delivered running/walking group program or an attention control condition. Primary feasibility and acceptability outcomes included program interest, study enrolment and retention, questionnaire completion, program attendance, program satisfaction, and affective exercise attitudes. Post-program interviews were conducted to ascertain participants' experiences with the program. Secondary outcomes included well-being, exercise behavior, social identity, social support, and exercise identity. Ninety-two individuals were screened for eligibility, and 72 were equally randomized to the online group program or attention control condition. Recruitment exceeded the target sample size (60), study adherence and questionnaire completion were above 90%, program attendance was moderate (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.03/8), self-report program satisfaction was moderate-to-high (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.13/5), and there was no condition effect for affective attitudes. During interviews, participants expressed satisfaction with the program. They also discussed challenges with developing a shared sense of identity and social connection with group members via online platforms. There were small condition effects for exercise-related well-being and exercise identity and no condition effects for the remaining secondary outcomes. Social identity scores were moderate (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.63/7). The STRIDE program was feasible and acceptable but should be delivered and piloted in-person before a full-scale efficacy trial is conducted. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04857918; 2021-04-20.
