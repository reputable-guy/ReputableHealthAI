Study Title: Patients' Expectations of Yoga and Associated Therapies Influence Treatment Outcome: A Convenience Sampling Pre-Post Study from India.

Study Summary:
An association between expectations of treatment and treatment outcome has been reported for conventional medical and surgical treatments. However, this association has not been described for yoga therapy. The present study recruited patients (154 males and 145 females, n = 299; age 48.8 &#xb1; 14.7 years) who had been admitted to a residential wellness center, most commonly with diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue; endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic diseases; and digestive system disorders (all based on ICD-11). Assessments included: (1) expectations of yoga and associated therapies at baseline using two questionnaires (Treatment Expectation Questionnaire and Expectation for Treatment Scale); and (2) treatment outcome at baseline and after 7 days of yoga and associated therapies using the Physical Health Questionnaire and Global Perceived Effect scale. The intervention included yoga and additional therapies (e.g., hydrotherapy and ayurveda for approximately 40% of the time). Multivariable regression analyses (controlled for variation due to age, gender, education, and baseline Physical Health Questionnaire scores) demonstrated that expectations of (1) positive outcomes of all aspects of treatment significantly predicted better overall perceived effect of treatment; (2) symptom resolution (positive expectations) significantly predicted higher total Physical Health Questionnaire scores, with better digestion; and (3) low adverse outcomes significantly predicted better sleep. The findings support the premise that higher positive expectations and lower negative expectations of yoga therapy predict better treatment outcomes. These findings suggest that people should be well-informed about the reported benefits and the less-frequent negative outcomes of yoga therapy so that their expectations may be positive yet realistic, optimally influencing treatment outcomes.
