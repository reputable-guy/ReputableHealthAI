Study Title: Impact of withholding early parenteral nutrition on 2-year mortality and functional outcome in critically ill adults.

Study Summary:
In critically ill adults, withholding parenteral nutrition until 1&#xa0;week after intensive care admission (Late-PN) facilitated recovery as compared with early supplementation of insufficient enteral nutrition with parenteral nutrition (Early-PN). However, the impact on long-term mortality and functional outcome, in relation to the estimated nutritional risk, remains unclear. In this prospective follow-up study of the multicenter EPaNIC randomized controlled trial, we investigated the impact of Late-PN on 2-year mortality (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;4640) and physical functioning, assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; in 3292 survivors, responding 819 [738-1058] days post-randomization). To account for missing data, we repeated the analyses in two imputed models. To identify potential heterogeneity of treatment effects, we investigated the impact of Late-PN in different nutritional risk subgroups as defined by Nutritional Risk Screening-2002-score, modified NUTrition Risk in the Critically Ill-score, and age (above/below 70&#xa0;years), and we evaluated whether there was statistically significant interaction between classification to a nutritional risk subgroup and the effect of the randomized intervention. Secondary outcomes were SF-36-derived physical and mental component scores (PCS & MCS). Two-year mortality (20.5% in Late-PN, 19.8% in Early-PN; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54) and physical functioning (70 [40-90] in both study-arms; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.99) were similar in both groups, also after imputation of missing physical functioning data. Likewise, Late-PN had no impact on 2-year mortality and physical functioning in any nutritional risk subgroup. PCS and MCS were similar in both groups. Late-PN did not alter 2-year survival and physical functioning in adult critically ill patients, independent of anticipated nutritional risk.
