Study Title: Optimizing parenting and child outcomes following parent-child interaction therapy - toddler: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Toddler (PCIT-T) is an attachment-informed intervention model designed to meet the specific developmental needs of toddlers aged 12-24&#xa0;months presenting with challenging behaviors. This study used a randomized controlled design to evaluate outcomes of PCIT-T for children aged 14-24&#xa0;months with disruptive behaviors. Ninety toddlers with parent-reported disruptive behavior were randomly allocated to PCIT-T (intervention), an active control condition (Circle of Security- Parenting&#x2122;; COS-P), or a non-treatment control condition (wait-list; WL). Outcomes were assessed at baseline (Time 1), post treatment/post waitlist (Time 2) and 4-month follow-up (Time 3). At follow-up, the PCIT-T group displayed the highest levels of parenting sensitivity and positive parental verbalizations, and the lowest levels of negative child-directed verbalizations and non-attuned mind-minded statements. Of the three groups, the PCIT-T group showed the greatest degree of change on these variables, followed by the COS-P group and then the non-treated controls. The PCIT-T group were also the only group to show significant within-group improvements in sensitivity, self-reported parental reflectiveness, empathy and emotional understanding, parent-reported child social competence, child internalizing problems, and general behavior issues. Significant reductions in parental stress, child externalizing behaviors and parenting behaviors were seen for both the PCIT-T and COS-P groups. Delivered in the early intervention period of toddlerhood, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Toddler has the potential to bring about significant changes for children presenting with early onset behavioral issues.
