Study Title: The effect of mandala coloring and free coloring on the happiness in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder in the Covid-19 pandemic: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can lead to complications such as depression and grief, which are more prevalent in veterans than in the general population. Recently, art-making, including mandala coloring, has gained attention as a potential treatment for PTSD patients. This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 84 male veterans diagnosed with PTSD and hospitalized at the Milad Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran. The patients were recruited using a convenience sampling method and were assigned to either the mandala coloring group or the free coloring group. The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist DSM-5 and the Oxford Happiness Scale were used to collect data. The intervention group colored mandala designs, while the control group colored squares freely. Coloring was done twice a week for three weeks. The mean baseline happiness scores did not differ significantly between mandala coloring group and free coloring group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.376). However, at the end of study, happiness scores were significantly higher in mandala coloring group than in free coloring group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). After the intervention, happiness score of both groups increased significantly (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Both coloring methods increased veterans' happiness scores; however, mandala coloring was more effective than free coloring. It is recommended that art-making be added to conventional treatments for veterans with PTSD. This study was registered in Iranian Registry of clinical trials (No. IRCT20210604051491N1, 29/08/2021).
