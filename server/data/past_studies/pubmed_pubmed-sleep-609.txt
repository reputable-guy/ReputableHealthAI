Study Title: Effectiveness of remote monitoring in improving CPAP compliance and the impact of preexisting organisation of standard care: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
PURPOSE&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is often the treatment of choice for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Short-term adherence and early perceived benefits are the best predictors of long-term adherence. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of telemonitoring in the first period of treatment with CPAP (auto-titrating PAP) on compliance and the long-term outcome. Patients aged between 18-75&#xa0;years old with symptomatic severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;30) requiring CPAP therapy were included in this single-blind, single-centre, randomised, controlled trial. They were divided into 2 groups (telemonitored standard clinical care versus standard clinical care without telemonitoring). A total of 230 patients (115 patients/group) were included (mean age 54&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;16.6&#xa0;years, BMI 32.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.4&#xa0;kg/m, ESS 13.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.2, AHI 47.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14.8/hr). At week 10 compliance was similar in both groups (telemonitoring vs control 6:27 and 6:35&#xa0;h, respectively, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.57), as were AHI (2.4; 2.4/hr, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.89) and ESS (5.8; 4.9, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22). The number of contacts of a patient with a healthcare professional was significantly higher during the follow-up from week 3 until week 10 (0.25; 0.13, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). The number of patients who could be evaluated after 1&#xa0;year was equally distributed in both groups (104; 104, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.00), as were compliance (6:43; 6:49&#xa0;h, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59) and residual AHI (1.9; 2.2/hr, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41). In patients with severe OSA with standard intensive follow-up during the initial weeks of CPAP therapy and good compliance, telemonitoring did not improve CPAP compliance nor the clinical outcome in the short or long term. The practical consequences can be highly relevant for patients and healthcare professionals.
