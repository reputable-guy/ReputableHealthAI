Study Title: Effectiveness of manual lymphatic drainage in women with fibromyalgia: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
Currently there is no treatment capable of significantly alleviating all the symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM), even though it is a complex syndrome with a high prevalence in the population. Experimental study using a single-blind, randomised, clinical trial. To analyse the efficacy of manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) as an alternative to traditional treatment of fibromyalgia (FM) in women. This was an experimental study using a single-blind, randomised, clinical trial of 20 women between 30 and 55 years old with FM. Patients were divided into an experimental group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) and a control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10). During the study, 3 measurements of pain (visual analogue scale and algometry), FM impact (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), sleep quality (Index Pittsburgh), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were recorded. Treatment of the experimental group consisted of 2 weekly MLD sessions for 6 weeks. The effect of the interaction of MLD showed statistically significant results in Right intercostal space (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.54; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04; np&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.16). The sleep quality was significantly better favour of the treatment (F&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.16; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01; np&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.20). MLD therapy demonstrated effects in the experimental group in contrast to the control group across the intervention period concerning the right intercostal space and sleep-related factors. However, MLD did not result in observable alterations in pain perception.
