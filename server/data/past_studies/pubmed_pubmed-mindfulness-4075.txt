Study Title: Effects of Mindfulness Meditation on Patient Experience During Urodynamics: A Prospective Study.

Study Summary:
Urodynamics (UDS) assesses voiding dysfunction using intravesical, vaginal, or rectal catheters, which can be distressing. This study was aimed at utilizing mindfulness to reduce anxiety and pain in patients undergoing UDS. A single-institution randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients who underwent UDS. Patients were assigned to a mindfulness group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) or a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30). Before UDS testing, all patients completed validated questionnaires assessing lower urinary tract symptoms (Urogenital Distress Inventory 6, UDI-6), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 6, STAI-6), and pain (Visual Analog Scale, VAS). The mindfulness group listened to a mindfulness audio prompt before UDS. All patients received standardized UDS education before UDS testing in a calm environment. After UDS testing, all patients completed validated UDS-perception questionnaires, STAI-6, Likert scale, and VAS surveys. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t tests, independent t tests, Wilcoxon, and Chi-squared tests. Both groups had similar demographics, history of prior UDS, anxiety, and baseline UDI-6 and STAI-6. Post-UDS, anxiety scores decreased in both groups, with the mindfulness group reporting significant improvement in "calmness" (mean&#x2009;1.7, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.84) compared with the control group (mean&#x2009;2.3, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The mindfulness group reported increased relaxation whereas the control group reported decreased relaxation post-UDS. Patients in both groups without a history of UDS had a significant improvement in total anxiety compared with those with a history of UDS. Mindfulness meditation may improve calmness and relaxation for patients undergoing UDS.
