Study Title: Understanding and enhancing post-stroke recovery: Insights from a nested qualitative study within the MindFit Project randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Stroke survivors experience a wide range of physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges. In the MindFit Project, a randomized clinical trial, 141 chronic stroke patients were divided into three groups: mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with computerized cognitive training (CCT), physical exercise (PE) with CCT, and CCT alone. The interventions were conducted remotely over 12 weeks, including online group and individual sessions. This exploratory nested qualitative study aimed to investigate chronic stroke survivors' experiences, opinions, and perceived changes due to the interventions within the MindFit Project. The secondary objective was to describe the broader experience of their recovery journey. Twenty-seven participants were recruited through purposive sampling and engaged in semi-structured one-on-one interviews. Twelve received MBSR+CCT, nine received PE+CCT, and six received CCT-only. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Participants shared insights into their lives after stroke, including emotional and physical challenges, coping mechanisms, and the impact of societal perceptions. The interventions were generally positively valued, with MBSR aiding in emotional regulation, PE enhancing physical capabilities, and CCT improving cognition. The group setting provided valuable peer support and motivation, although some participants noted challenges owing to the heterogeneity. The telematic format was also appreciated for its accessibility, although it posed challenges to personal interaction and intervention supervision. Our study emphasizes the complexity of stroke recovery and the importance of holistic, patient-centered rehabilitation approaches. It also highlights the value of combining physical and non-physical interventions in a group setting, along with the potential of remote platforms to enhance the accessibility of rehabilitation programs. These findings generate hypotheses for future randomized clinical trials aimed at improving post-stroke recovery.
