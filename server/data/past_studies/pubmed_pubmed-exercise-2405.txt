Study Title: Effects of shuttle balance exercises on gait speed, postural control, and quality of life in older males: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Enhancing physical function and quality of life in older adults at higher risk of falls is challenging because of the lack of established interventions. This study examines the impact of a 6-week balance training program using the shuttle balance device on gait speed, postural control, and quality of life in older men. This single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in a research laboratory. Thirty-two participants aged &#x2265;60&#xa0;years were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (EG; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;16) or a control group (CG; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;14). The EG participated in a 6-week shuttle balance exercise program, while the CG maintained regular physical activity routines. The main outcome measures included gait speed (assessed via the timed up and go test), postural control (assessed via center of pressure data on a force plate), and quality of life (evaluated using the SF-36 questionnaire). Post-intervention, the EG showed significant improvements compared with the CG (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The 95% confidence intervals for the differences between groups were as follows: closed eyes (CE) mean velocity (-39.07, -0.13), CE sway area (-48.86, -0.18), SF-36 total score (9.01, 16.81), SF-36 physical functioning (7.00, 24.81), SF-36 physical role functioning (1.80, 27.57), SF-36 pain (15.01, 36.82), SF-36 general health state (7.48, 26.08), SF-36 vitality (5.60, 28.35), and SF-36 mental health (0.21, 21.12). A 6-week shuttle balance training program significantly improves postural control and quality of life in older males. These findings suggest the potential effectiveness of shuttle balance exercises in enhancing physical function and well-being in this population. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the long-term effects with larger sample sizes.
