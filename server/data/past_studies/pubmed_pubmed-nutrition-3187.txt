Study Title: Associations Between Life's Essential 8 and Major Ocular Diseases in the American Middle-Aged and Elderly Population.

Study Summary:
To explore the correlation between cardiovascular health (CVH) and ocular diseases, given their shared risk factors and biological mechanisms, this study utilizes the newly updated Life's Essential 8 (LE8) algorithm. A cross-sectional study. This analysis, conducted from February 15 to April 1, 2024, in Changchun, includes data from 4146 participants aged 40 and above, drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database (2005-2008). It covers information on visual health status, dietary habits through interviews, and professional ophthalmological examinations. Participants' CVH status was assessed using the LE8 algorithm, and relationships with major ocular diseases such as retinopathy, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were explored through weighted logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic splines, stratified analysis, and sensitivity analysis. After multivariable adjustment, lower LE8 scores showed a significant positive relationship with any ocular disease (odds ratio [OR]: 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39-2.96, P = .001), any objectively determined ocular disease (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.48-3.38, P < .001), retinopathy (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.89-4.41, P < .001), diabetic retinopathy (OR: 10.23, 95% CI: 3.11-33.61, P < .001), and glaucoma (OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.47-5.21, P = .003), with all trends significant (all P < .01). Additionally, lower scores in the behavioral subdomain were significantly correlated with an elevated risk of cataracts (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.03-2.04). Subgroup analyses revealed more pronounced negative correlations between LE8 and retinopathy among females and those suffering from chronic kidney disease. A low CVH score was linked to an increased likelihood of ocular diseases in a US-populated-based study. This correlation supports the potential benefits of enhancing cardiovascular wellness to mitigate the development of ocular conditions.
