Study Title: Long-term treatment outcomes of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for fatigue in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: Results of a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Fatigue is prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. Previously, we showed that fatigued IBD patients experienced a significant decrease in fatigue after receiving mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). The current study examined to what extent these short-term beneficial effects of MBCT on fatigue were maintained over nine months follow-up, and whether patient characteristics were associated with clinically relevant improvement in fatigue. A randomized controlled trial, including an MBCT and waiting-list control condition, was performed in fatigued IBD patients in remission. For this study, we analysed long-term outcomes of 108 patients who received MBCT (either directly or after three months waiting). The primary outcome was fatigue, assessed with the Checklist Individual Strenght-20. Secondary outcomes included fatigue interference, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. The reduced level of fatigue post-treatment did not change significantly during follow-up (F(2,76)&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.68, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.19). In total, 29% of patients reported clinically relevant improvement from pre-treatment to nine months follow-up. We found few significant differences in baseline characteristics between those reporting clinically relevant improvement and those not, except that patients who improved were significantly more often unemployed (&#x3c7;(1, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;73)&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.40, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04). Secondary outcomes, which did not change significantly during MBCT, also remained stable during follow-up. Findings suggest that reductions in IBD-related fatigue after receiving MBCT are sustained over nine months follow-up, with around one-third of patients reporting clinically relevant improvement from pre-treatment to follow-up. Employment status might be related to improvements in fatigue. Future research is needed to confirm these long-term outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03162575.
