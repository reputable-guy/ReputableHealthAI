Study Title: Predicting response to stepped-care cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia using pre-treatment heart rate variability in cancer patients.

Study Summary:
This study examined whether high frequency heart-rate variability (HF-HRV) and HF-HRV reactivity to worry moderate response to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) within both a standard and stepped-care framework among cancer patients with comorbid insomnia. Biomarkers such as HF-HRV may predict response to CBT-I, a finding which could potentially inform patient allocation to different treatment intensities within a stepped-care framework. 177 participants (86.3&#xa0;% female; M&#xa0;=&#xa0;55.3, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;10.4) were randomized to receive either stepped-care or standard CBT-I. 145 participants had their HRV assessed at pre-treatment during a rest and worry period. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and daily sleep diary across five timepoints from pre-treatment to a 12-month post-treatment follow-up. Resting HF-HRV was significantly associated with pre-treatment sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency but not ISI score. However, resting HF-HRV did not predict overall changes in insomnia across treatment and follow-up. Similarly, resting HF-HRV did not differentially predict changes in sleep diary parameters across standard or stepped-care groups. HRV reactivity was not related to any of the assessed outcome measures in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Although resting HF-HRV was related to initial daily sleep parameters, HF-HRV measures did not significantly predict longitudinal responses to CBT-I. These findings suggest that HF-HRV does not predict treatment responsiveness to CBT-I interventions of different intensity in cancer patients.
