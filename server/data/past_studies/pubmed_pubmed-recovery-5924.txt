Study Title: Effect of Clavipectoral Fascia Suturing on Postmastectomy Seroma Formation.

Study Summary:
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Post-mastectomy seroma formation is a challenging sequela which has a negative impact on patient recovery and quality of life.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; We aim to publicize our technique of clavipectoral fascia re-closure and to assess its efficacy in reducing the incidence of seroma formation.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective randomized controlled trial, conducted in South Cancer institute, Assiut University, Egypt. It included 84 breast cancer patients who were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (n = 44) and a fascia suture group (n = 40). The patients were followed up until drain removal and then to 3 months after surgery.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The fascia suture group showed significantly shorter duration of drain removal with a significant reduction in the total amount of drained fluid and the amount of drained fluid 1 week postoperatively. One patient in the fascia suture group developed Grade 2-3 seroma vs. 7 in the control group (P &lt; 0.05).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Clavipectoral fascia suture technique is a simple and effective method for reducing seroma formation after mastectomy in breast cancer patients and is advisable in patients at a high risk for seroma formation.&lt;/br&gt.
