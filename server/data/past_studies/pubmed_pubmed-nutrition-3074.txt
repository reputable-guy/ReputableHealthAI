Study Title: Effect of antenatal use of high energy nutritional supplements on cardio metabolic risk markers in underweight primi gravidas; a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Pregnancy is a state of increased metabolic demand, and poor maternal nutrition can exacerbate these changes, potentially increasing the risk of cardiometabolic disorders.This study is significant as it investigates the effect of high energy nutritional supplements on cardio metabolic risk markers in underweight primigravidas. A single blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted from April 2018- August 2019 among the Pakistani tertiary care facilities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A total of thirty six participants were randomized into two groups receiving either high energy nutritional supplement 'MAAMTA' or Placebo. They were instructed to take Placebo/Supplement alongside to their regular prenatal care and food from their first antenatal visit till a week postnatally. Anthropometric measurements and blood samples for biochemical parameters insulinlevels, fasting blood glucose & lipid profile were taken at baseline visit, between 16 and 20 weeks gestation and a post natal visit. The two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a highly significant time effect on participant's Insulin level (F (1.8, 53.6)&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.64, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0 0.000, &#x3b7;p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.269). A highly significant time effect on participant's insulin resistance (F (2, 68)&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.116,P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0 0.001, &#x3b7;p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.193) was also observed. There was a highly significant time effect on participant's LDL level as well (F (2, 68)&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.82, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0 0.000, &#x3b7;p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.258). Supplementation with high energy nutritional supplements may improve insulin levels and insulin sensitivity in underweight primigravidas. https://www. gov ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ISRCTN 10088578.
