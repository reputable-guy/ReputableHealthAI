Study Title: The effect of web-based education delivered as part of cardiac rehabilitation on healthy lifestyle behaviors, and quality of life in patients with coronary artery disease in Turkey: A randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of web-based education delivered as part of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on healthy lifestyle behaviors, and quality of life in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in Turkey. This study is a randomized controlled trial. The experimental group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;35) received web-based education and telephone counseling for 12 weeks after discharge, while the control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;35) received standard care. Post-test healthy lifestyle behaviors scale total score and total scores of all sub-dimensions except nutrition were higher in the experimental group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The post-test international physical activity total score, and VAS scale scores of the experimental group and were significantly higher (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The number of non-smoking patients in the post-test was statistically significantly higher in the experimental group (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The results showed that web-based education delivered as part of CR in a Turkish hospital improved healthy lifestyle behaviors, physical activity level, and quality of life in CAD. Our study proved that web-based education delivered as part of CR, nurse follow-up, and telephone counseling services may be effective tools for CAD patients to adhere to healthy lifestyle behaviors, and to promote quality of life and smoking cessation.
