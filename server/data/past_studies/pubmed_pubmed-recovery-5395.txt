Study Title: Relative effects of serratus anterior plane block performed with dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine or ropivacaine alone on quality of recovery in children undergoing ear reconstruction.

Study Summary:
Dexmedetomidine (Dex) as a local anesthesia adjuvant for nerve block procedures can improve the quality of patient recovery. However, the impact of using Dex as a local anesthetic adjuvant for serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) procedures on recovery quality for children undergoing ear reconstruction remains unclear. Eighty-four patients who underwent ear reconstruction with autogenous costal cartilage (ACC) were randomized into two groups (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42/group) in which SAPB was performed with ropivacaine alone (R group) and with Dex and ropivacaine (DR group). Primary outcomes were patient 15-item quality of recovery (QoR-15) scale scores on days 1 and 2 post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative rest and coughing numerical rating scale (NRS) chest pain scores, duration of analgesia, oral rescue analgesic usage, and opioid-related side effects. Forty patients per group completed the study. QoR-15 scores on days 1 and 2 post-surgery in the DR group were significantly increased relative to the R group (126.35&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9.81 vs. 115.53&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8.58 and 131.78&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8.67 vs. 122.80&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8.59, all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Rest and coughing NRS chest pain scores at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24&#xa0;h postoperatively in the DR group were all significantly lower relative to the R group (all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). The DR group also exhibited significantly longer analgesic duration (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001)&#xa0;and significantly reduced incidences of oral rescue analgesic usage and opioid-related side effect (all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Combining Dex and ropivacaine for SAPB in children undergoing ear reconstruction with ACC can significantly improve the quality of recovery, quality of analgesia, and analgesic duration.
