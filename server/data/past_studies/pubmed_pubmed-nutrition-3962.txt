Study Title: Sweetener System Intervention Shifted Neutrophils from Homeostasis to Priming.

Study Summary:
Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are part of personalized nutrition strategies supporting healthy glycemic control. In contrast, the consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners has been related to person-specific and microbiome-dependent glycemic impairments. Reports on the effects of NNS on our highly individual cellular immune system are sparse. The recent identification of taste receptor expression in a variety of immune cells, however, suggested their immune-modulatory relevance. We studied the influence of a beverage-typical NNS system on the transcriptional profiling of sweetener-cognate taste receptors, selected cytokines and their receptors, and on Casignaling in isolated blood neutrophils. We determined plasma concentrations of saccharin, acesulfame-K, and cyclamate by HPLC-MS/MS, upon ingestion of a soft drink-typical sweetener surrogate. In an open-labeled, randomized intervention study, we determined pre- versus post-intervention transcript levels by RT-qPCR of sweetener-cognate taste receptors and immune factors. Here we show that the consumption of a food-typical sweetener system modulated the gene expression of cognate taste receptors and induced the transcriptional regulation signatures of early homeostasis- and late receptor/signaling- and inflammation-related genes in blood neutrophils, shifting their transcriptional profile from homeostasis to priming. Notably, sweeteners at postprandial plasma concentrations facilitated fMLF (-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe)-induced Casignaling. Our results support the notion of sweeteners priming neutrophils to higher alertness towards their adequate stimuli.
