Study Title: Effects of Acute Ingestion of Guarana () on Soccer Player Performance: A Randomized, Cross-over, Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
To investigate the acute effects of ingesting a beverage containing guarana () seed powder on performance during field tests related to physical capacities that are determinants of soccer performance, such as lower limb power, sprint, agility, and the capacity to carry out intermittent exercise. The study was conducted using a randomized, crossover, and counterbalanced design, with a beverage containing guarana or placebo administered in a double-blind manner. Twenty-seven under-17 soccer players of a professional soccer club performed a battery of tests 60&#x2009;min after the ingestion of guarana (3&#x2009;g of the fruit seed powder) or placebo. Trials were performed with a 7-day washout period. The battery of tests included a countermovement jump test, sprints of 10 and 20&#x2009;m, an Illinois agility test, and a Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (YYIR1). Guarana ingestion did not improve countermovement jump, sprints, or agility (&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). However, guarana ingestion increased the distance covered in the YYIR1, compared with placebo ingestion (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Acute ingestion of guarana improves the capacity to perform intermittent exercise in soccer players but seems to be ineffective to improve lower limb power, sprint, and agility.
