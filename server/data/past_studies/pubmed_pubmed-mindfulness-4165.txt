Study Title: An Online Mindfulness-Based Group Intervention for Tics: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Current treatments for Tourette syndrome (TS) and persistent tic disorder (PTD) are often insufficiently effective, inaccessible, and frequently associated with adverse events. Thus, we must continue to develop and test effective, accessible, and safe treatment options. We aimed to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a novel, videoconference-delivered group mindfulness-based intervention for tics (MBIT) to videoconference-delivered group psychoeducation, relaxation, and supportive therapy (PRST) for adults with TS or PTD. Thirty-two adults with TS or PTD were randomly assigned to receive 8&#x2009;weeks of either MBIT or PRST. Tic severity, tic-related impairment, and global improvement were assessed by a trained, independent evaluator who was masked to treatment condition at baseline (week 0), posttreatment (week 9), 1-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. All study procedures were conducted online via secure videoconferencing. Twenty-eight participants began treatment and were included in analyses. MBIT, relative to PRST, was associated with a significantly greater decline in tic severity (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.85) and tic-related impairment (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.99) from baseline to posttreatment. Treatment response was significantly higher in MBIT (69%) than in PRST (13%). Neither treatment resulted in serious adverse effects. The durability of treatment outcomes is also reported and discussed. The results from this pilot RCT suggest that videoconference-delivered group MBIT may be an efficacious, accessible, and safe intervention for adults with tics. Future research is necessary to confirm these preliminary findings. &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).
