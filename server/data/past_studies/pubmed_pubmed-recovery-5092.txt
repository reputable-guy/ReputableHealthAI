Study Title: Detrimental Effect of Acute Hyperglycemia on the Outcomes of Large Ischemic Region Stroke.

Study Summary:
Although endovascular therapy (EVT) is effective for large ischemic region strokes, the impact of hyperglycemia remains unclear. We analyzed data from the RESCUE-Japan LIMIT (Recovery by Endovascular Salvage for Cerebral Ultra-Acute Embolism-Japan Large Ischemic Core) trial, which randomized stroke patients with Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score of 3 to 5 to EVT versus medical management. Outcomes were compared among patients with normoglycemia (<140&#x2009;mg/dL), moderate hyperglycemia (&#x2265;140, <180&#x2009;mg/dL), and severe hyperglycemia (&#x2265;180&#x2009;mg/dL) on admission. Among 200 patients (median age 76.5&#x2009;years, median glucose level 131&#x2009;mg/dL, EVT 50%), diabetes prevalence was 10.0%, 18.4%, and 71.0% in the groups with normoglycemia (n=120), moderate hyperglycemia (n=49), and severe hyperglycemia (n=31), respectively. Achievement of modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 3 at 90&#x2009;days was less frequent in the group with severe hyperglycemia (6.5%) than in the groups with normoglycemia (25.0%) and moderate hyperglycemia (24.5%), with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of 1.48 (95% CI, 0.59-3.72) for moderate and 0.17 (95% CI, 0.03-0.95) for severe hyperglycemia relative to normoglycemia. The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher for moderate hyperglycemia (6.1%; aOR, 2.86 [95% CI, 0.42-19.71]) and particularly for severe hyperglycemia (25.8%; aOR, 18.59 [95% CI, 2.47-139.87]) compared with normoglycemia (2.5%). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates were similar for EVT and medical management in normoglycemia (1.6% versus 3.4%) and moderate hyperglycemia (5.0% versus 6.9%), but for severe hyperglycemia, the rate was higher in patients with EVT (36.8%) than in those without (8.3%). Severe hyperglycemia was associated with worse functional prognosis and increased symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in large ischemic region strokes. URL:&#xa0;https://clinicaltrials.gov.
