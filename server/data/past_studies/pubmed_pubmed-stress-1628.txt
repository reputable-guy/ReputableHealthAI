Study Title: Altered oxidative neurometabolic response to methylene blue in bipolar disorder revealed by quantitative neuroimaging.

Study Summary:
Cerebral mitochondrial and hemodynamic abnormalities have been implicated in Bipolar Disorder pathophysiology, likely contributing to neurometabolic vulnerability-leading to worsen clinical outcomes and mood instability. To investigate neurometabolic vulnerability in patients with BD, we combined multi-modal quantitative MRI assessment of cerebral oxygenation with acute administration of Methylene Blue, a neurometabolic/hemodynamic modulator acting on cerebral mitochondria. Fifteen euthymic patients with chronic BD-type 1, and fifteen age/gender-matched healthy controls underwent two separate MRI sessions in a single-blinded randomized cross-over design, each after intravenous infusion of either MB (0.5&#xa0;mg/kg) or placebo. MRI-based measures of Cerebral Blood Flow and Oxygen Extraction Fraction were integrated to compute Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Oxygen in Frontal Lobe, Anterior Cingulate, and Hippocampus-implicated in BD neurometabolic pathophysiology. Inter-daily variation in mood rating was used to assess mood instability. A decrease in global CBF and CMROwas observed after acutely administrating MB to all participants. Greater regional CMROreductions were observed after MB, in patients compared to controls in FL (mean&#xa0;=&#xa0;-14.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;19.5&#xa0;% versus 2.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;14.8&#xa0;%), ACC (mean&#xa0;=&#xa0;-14.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;23.7&#xa0;% versus 2.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;15.7&#xa0;%). The effects on CMROin those regions were primarily driven by patients with longer disease duration and higher mood instability. Sample size; medications potentially impacting on response to MB. An altered neurometabolic response to MB, a mitochondrial/hemodynamic modulator, was observed in patients, supporting the hypothesis of vulnerability to neurometabolic stress in BD. Integrating quantitative imaging of cerebral oxygen metabolism with a mitochondrial-targeting pharmacological challenge could provide a novel biomarker of neurometabolic and cerebrovascular pathophysiology in BD.
