Study Title: Bifidobacterium breve M-16V regulates the autonomic nervous system via the intestinal environment: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Study Summary:
We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the potential of Bifidobacterium breve M-16&#xa0;V to improve mood in humans. In this evaluation, we incorporated the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which has been used to evaluate mood states in studies with small sample sizes. Participants were given B. breve M-16&#xa0;V (20 billion cells/day) for 6 weeks, and their mood state was assessed before and after ingestion. NIRS data were collected at rest and during a mental arithmetic task (under stress). Intake of B. breve M-16&#xa0;V decreased the heart rate under stress and increased levels of the GABA-like substance pipecolic acid in stool samples. In addition, B. breve M-16&#xa0;V improved mood and sleep scores in participants with high anxiety levels. These results suggest that B. breve M-16&#xa0;V affects the metabolites of the gut microbiota and has the potential to modulate the autonomic nervous system and to improve mood and sleep.
