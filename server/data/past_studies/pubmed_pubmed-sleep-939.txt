Study Title: Can extending time between vital sign checks improve sleep in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients? Testing feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy.

Study Summary:
Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) experience barriers to quality sleep. Frequent vital sign checks are necessary early posttransplant given risk of complications but can disrupt sleep. This study tested feasibility and acceptability of extending time between checking vitals (EVs) from every 4 to every 6&#xa0;h to improve sleep. HSCT patients ages 8-21 years (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;50, mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;14.06, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.58) and their caregivers were enrolled 1-2 days prior to transplant, and 40 patients completed the 15-day study (NCT04106089). Patients wore an actigraph to estimate sleep and provided self- and caregiver-report of sleep. Sleep was observed for nights 0 to +4 posttransplant, and patients were then randomized to EVs either Days +5 to +9 or +10 to +14. Patients were assessed daily for medical eligibility to receive EVs; on days patients were eligible, nightshift nurses (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;79) reported EV acceptability. Of 200 potential nights for EVs (5 nights x 40 patients), patients were eligible for EVs on 126 nights (63% of eligible nights), and patients received EVs on 116 (92%) of eligible nights. Most patients received EVs &#x2265;3 nights (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26, 65%, median&#xa0;=&#xa0;3 nights). Most patients (85%), caregivers (80%), and nurses (84%) reported that patients used the additional 2&#xa0;h during EVs for sleep, with reporters indicating moderate to high acceptability. There was preliminary evidence of efficacy indicated by caregiver-reported sleep disturbance and actigraphy-estimated improvements in sleep efficiency during EVs. Extending time between vitals checks is highly acceptable to patients, caregivers, and nurses, and may offer a feasible approach to improve sleep in pediatric HSCT.
