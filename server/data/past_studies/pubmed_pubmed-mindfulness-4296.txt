Study Title: Scoping Review of Programmatic Well-Being Interventions and Outcomes to Support Pharmacy Students.

Study Summary:
Recent literature highlights various well-being initiatives implemented across pharmacy programs; however, there is much heterogeneity in their implementation and limited studies assessing the impact and success of these initiatives on pharmacy students' well-being. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify the effectiveness of strategies implemented by pharmacy schools to improve the well-being of pharmacy students. In total, 23 studies were included, and well-being strategies were categorized into 3 groups: organizational wellness programs, curriculum design and educational course activities, and specific relaxation or meditation activities. Strategies included yoga meditation, structured mindfulness courses, and self-directed mindfulness with digital smartphone applications. The majority of studies assessed outcomes of stress, burnout, and mindfulness, though other well-being domains such as resilience and belonging emerged. Some also assessed perceptions and acceptability of the interventions through qualitative approaches. Despite the heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, this review provides a comprehensive scope of well-being domains, assessment tools, interventions, and approaches targeted at pharmacy students and highlights the strongest evidence for interventions on reducing stress. Pharmacy programs can benefit from approaches at both the organization level and those fostering individual accountability by exposing students to a variety of self-help well-being strategies that develop protective factors and motivate them to sustain well-being practices themselves as a shared approach. This scoping review addresses a critical gap by gaining an understanding of the current landscape of well-being initiatives and their effectiveness to better guide pharmacy programs on strategies that are most likely to improve student well-being.
