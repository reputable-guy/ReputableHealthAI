Study Title: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial in Women With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer to Assess the Feasibility of Delivering Group-Based Psychosocial Care via Videoconference.

Study Summary:
The goal of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering group-based psychosocial care via videoconference (ie, Zoom) to women with lung cancer undergoing treatment. At baseline, women indicated their typical computer and internet use and were then randomized to a group-based intervention that either focused on mindfulness training or psychoeducation. Participants completed 1 Zoom "practice run" prior to starting the 5 group sessions (1 per week). After the last session, they evaluated their experiences with the intervention and its delivery. With a consent rate of 68%, 54 women (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;66&#x2009;years; 69% non-Hispanic White; 48% with stage IV disease) were equally randomized. Attendance was high in both arms (session mean, mindfulness&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.38; education&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.75; 85% attended all sessions). Across arms, all women rated the program as useful; most preferred group-based delivery (67%) and remote delivery (50%) or had no preference. Although the sample's typical computer use was relatively low (eg, 19% said that they rarely or never use a computer), most women (76%) indicated that Zoom was "very easy" or "easy" to use. After only 0 to 1 attempts, 56% felt comfortable but 26% stated that they never felt comfortable with the technology. It seems to be feasible to deliver group-based psychosocial interventions via videoconference in women with lung cancer undergoing treatment. Challenges regarding scheduling the group sessions and familiarizing older rather than infrequent computer users with the technology were encountered but resolved over the course of the trial.
