Study Title: Effect of sugammadex with neostigmine on postoperative bowel function and on recovery of neuromuscular functions: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Early recovery of neuromuscular and bowel function after abdominal surgery are important clinical indicators of postoperative recovery. This study aimed to investigate the effects of sugammadex, and neostigmine added to sugammadex, on postoperative bowel function and recovery from neuromuscular blocking agents. Ninety gynecological surgery patients, aged 18 to 65 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists of 1 to 2 were randomly assigned to 3 groups: sugammadex 2&#x2009;mg/kg (Group S), sugammadex 1 m/kg with neostigmine 20 &#xb5;g/kg&#x2005;+&#x2005;atropine 10 &#xb5;g/kg (Group S1N), and sugammadex 1.5&#x2009;mg/kg with neostigmine 20 &#xb5;g/kg&#x2005;+&#x2005;atropine 10 &#xb5;g/kg (Group S2N), for reversal at the end of surgery during moderate block (train-of-four [TOF] count 1-2). Propofol, remifentanil, rocuronium, and sevoflurane were used for general anesthesia, and neuromuscular function was assessed using kinemyography. The primary outcomes assessed the effects of sugammadex alone and in combination with neostigmine on the time to first flatus. The secondary outcomes included time to first defecation and recovery time; defined as the administration of reversal agent to TOF ratio 90%. Data from 90 female patients who underwent abdominal gynecological surgery were analyzed. No significant differences were found between the groups in term of the time to first flatus, defecation, or postoperative nausea and vomiting after surgery. However, significant differences were observed in the time to reach a TOF ratio 90% (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001) and extubation time (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.003). The addition of neostigmine to sugammadex did not affect bowel function recovery. However, combining 20 &#x3bc;g/kg neostigmine with 1.5&#x2009;mg/kg sugammadex or 2&#x2009;mg/kg sugammadex alone antagonized moderate-depth nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade with similar efficacy.
