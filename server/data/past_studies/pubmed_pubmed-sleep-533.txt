Study Title: Intervention effects of telenursing based on M-O-A model in empty-nest older adult individuals with chronic diseases: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study aims to verify the effectiveness of M-O-A telenursing intervention model in improving the health status and quality of life of the empty-nest older adult individuals with chronic diseases by a randomized comparative trial. M-O-A telenursing intervention model was constructed based on the needs of the participants. The control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;39) received routine nursing, the experimental group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;39) received M-O-A telenursing intervention in addition to routine nursing. After 12&#x2009;weeks of intervention, the intervention effects of being a participant in the two groups were evaluated. SPSS 26.0 was used for data analysis. After 12&#x2009;weeks of intervention, for the experimental group, each dimension of quality of life based on EQ-5D-3L became better, especially for "pain/discomfort," "anxiety/depression," "HRQoL" and "EQ-VAS" (all&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and each dimension of quality of life based on SF-36 became better too, especially for "GH," "BP," "RE," "MH," "VT," "SF," "PCS," "MCS," "SF-36" (all&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In addition, there was a statistical downward trend in blood pressure, blood glucose, weight, BMI, fat rate, nap duration, number of nocturnal awakenings, light sleep rate and a statistical upward trend in water rate, basal metabolic rate, nighttime sleep duration, deep sleep rate, rapid eye movement sleep rate, especially at the end of intervention (all&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). While for the control group, there was no statistical improvement in all these aspects. The M-O-A telenursing model could effectively regulate quality of life and health condition of the empty-nest older adult individuals with chronic diseases, making it worthy of further promotion and application.
