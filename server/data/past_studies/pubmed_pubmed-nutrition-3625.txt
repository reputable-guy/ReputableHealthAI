Study Title: Survivorship wellness: a multidisciplinary group program for cancer survivors.

Study Summary:
National mandates require cancer centers provide comprehensive survivorship care. We created an 8-session, group intervention, the Survivorship Wellness Group Program (SWGP), that covered 8 topics: nutrition, physical activity, stress, sleep/fatigue, sexuality/body image, emotional wellbeing/fear of cancer recurrence, spirituality/meaning, and health promotion/goal setting. This study examined the acceptability and preliminary outcomes of SWGP. We evaluated SWGP using questionnaire data collected at program entry and 15-week follow-up. Questionnaires assessed acceptability and impact on anxiety, depression, quality of life, and perceived knowledge of topics. Enrollees who consented to participate in research and completed the baseline and 15-week follow-up were included in the analysis (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;53). We assessed acceptability and preliminary outcomes using paired-samples t-tests. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SWGP transitioned to telehealth partway through data collection. Post-hoc analyses compared outcomes by intervention delivery. Participants completed an average of 7.44/8 classes. Participants reported a mean response of 3.42/4 regarding overall program satisfaction and 90.6% reported being "very likely" to recommend SWGP. SWGP was associated with decreases in anxiety and depression; increases in physical, emotional, functional, and overall quality of life; and increases in knowledge of all health behavior domains. No outcomes differed significantly between delivery in person versus telehealth. SWGP offers an acceptable and replicable model for cancer centers to meet national survivorship care guidelines. SWGP provides a comprehensive service for cancer survivors post-treatment, and was associated with better quality of life, fewer mental health symptoms, and increased knowledge in multiple domains of wellness.
