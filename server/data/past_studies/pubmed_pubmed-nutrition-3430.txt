Study Title: [The dynamic monitoring of gastric residual volume by ultrasound was used to guide the early nutritional treatment of patients with severe mechanical ventilation to gradually achieve the standard].

Study Summary:
To explore the application value of dynamic monitoring of gastric residual volume (GRV) in achieving different target energy in severe mechanical ventilation patients. A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted. Forty-two patients with mechanical ventilation admitted to the department of critical care medicine of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from July to December 2022 were enrolled. According to the random number table method, patients were divided into GRV guided enteral nutrition by traditional gastric juice pumpback method (control group, 22 patients) and GRV guided enteral nutrition by bedside ultrasound (test group, 20 patients). General data were collected from both groups, and clinical indicators such as hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), neutrophil percentage (Neut%), procalcitonin (PCT), absolute lymphocytes (LYM), prealbumin (PA), and retinol-binding protein (RBP) were dynamically observed. Inflammation, infection, immunity, nutritional indicators, and the incidence of reflux/aspiration, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were compared between the two groups, and further compared the proportion of patients with respectively to reach the target energy 25%, 50%, and 70% on days 1, 3, and 5 of initiated enteral nutrition. (1) There were no significant differences in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), duration of mechanical ventilation, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), severe nutritional risk score (NUTRIC) at admission between the two groups, indicating comparability. (2) On day 1 of initiated enteral nutrition, there were no significant differences in infection, inflammation, immunity and nutrition indicators between the two groups. On day 3 of initiated enteral nutrition, the hs-CRP in the test group was lower than that control group, LYM and PA were higher than those control group [hs-CRP (mg/L): 129.60&#xb1;75.18 vs. 185.20&#xb1;63.74, LYM: 1.00&#xb1;0.84 vs. 0.60&#xb1;0.41, PA (mg/L): 27.30&#xb1;3.66 vs. 22.30&#xb1;2.55, all P < 0.05]. On day 5 of initiated enteral nutrition, the hs-CRP, Neut%, PCT in the test group were lower than those control group, LYM and PA were higher than those control group [hs-CRP (mg/L): 101.70&#xb1;54.32 vs. 148.40&#xb1;36.35, Neut%: (85.50&#xb1;7.66)% vs. (92.90&#xb1;6.01)%, PCT (&#x3bc;g/L): 0.7 (0.3, 2.7) vs. 3.6 (1.2, 7.5), LYM: 1.00&#xb1;0.68 vs. 0.50&#xb1;0.38, PA (mg/L): 27.10&#xb1;4.57 vs. 20.80 &#xb1; 3.51, all P < 0.05]. There were no significantly differences in IL-6 and RBP between the two groups at different time points. (3) The proportion of 50% and 70% of achieved target energy in the test group on day 3, day 5 of initiated enteral nutrition were higher than those of the control group (70.0% vs. 36.4%, 70.0% vs. 36.4%, both P < 0.05). (4) The incidence of reflux/aspiration and VAP in the test group on day 5 of initiated enteral nutrition were significantly lower than those control group (incidence of reflux/aspiration: 5.0% vs. 28.6%, incidence of VAP: 10.0% vs. 36.4%, both P < 0.05). Dynamic monitoring of GRV by bedside ultrasound can accurately improve the proportion of 50% of achieved target energy on day 3 and 75% on day 5 in severe mechanical ventilation patients, improve the patient's inflammation, immune and nutritional status, and can prevent the occurrence of reflux/aspiration and VAP.
