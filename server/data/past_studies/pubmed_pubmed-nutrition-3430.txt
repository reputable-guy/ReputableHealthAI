Study Title: Satisfaction with a meal kit delivery program and feasibility of a phase I trial in the intervening in food insecurity to reduce and mitigate (InFoRM) childhood obesity study.

Study Summary:
Food and nutrition security interventions have been demonstrated to optimize health, prevent and treat chronic diseases among adult populations. Despite the increasing prevalence and intersection of food insecurity and childhood obesity in the United States, there are few food and nutrition security interventions targeted to children and families. The primary purpose of this phase I randomized, crossover trial was to assess the safety, acceptability and satisfaction of a meal kit delivery program among children with obesity living in households with food insecurity. Secondarily, we assessed the feasibility of our study design, recruitment and retention to inform future larger scale trials. We delivered 6&#x2009;weeks of healthy meal kits, which included fresh pre-portioned ingredients and simple picture-based recipes (two recipes/week) in English or Spanish to prepare one-pot, under 30-min meals (after preparation ~&#x2009;10 servings/week). Caregivers received and prepared the meal kits and reported overall satisfaction with the meal kit delivery program. A meal kit delivery intervention for children with obesity and food insecurity is acceptable and a phase I randomized, crossover trial is feasible.
