Study Title: Efficacy of a self-made tracheostomy oxygen delivery device for oxygen therapy during postoperative anesthesia recovery.

Study Summary:
Patients with tracheotomy are often monitored in the anesthesia recovery room after reoperation. During this period, oxygen therapy is necessary, and the existing tracheostomy oxygen supply device has many defects. To evaluate the efficacy of a self-made tracheostomy oxygen delivery device on oxygen therapy during postoperative anesthesia recovery. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, E and C, with 30 patients in each group, and admitted to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Patients in group E received oxygen through a self-made tracheostomy oxygen delivery device, while patients in group C were supplied oxygen through a unilateral nasal cannula. Respiration (R), pulse oximetry (SpO2), and the number of patients on ventilators were recorded at the time of admission (T0) and one hour after admission (T1). Rapid dry blood gas analyses were performed on 0.6 ml samples of arterial blood collected at T0 and T1. Compared to group C, patients in group E had significantly higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), total carbon dioxide (T-CO2), and actual bicarbonate (AB), while arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was significantly reduced (P< 0.01 or < 0.05). Compared to T0, PaO2 decreased in both groups at T1, PaCO2 decreased in group E, while SaO2, T-CO2, and AB decreased in group C (P< 0.01 or < 0.05). We found that using the self-made tracheostomy oxygen delivery device in postoperative anesthesia recovery had advantages such as a secure connection to the tracheostoma, adjustable oxygen concentration, air filtration, and the ability to switch oxygen supply between the ventilator and humidifier.
