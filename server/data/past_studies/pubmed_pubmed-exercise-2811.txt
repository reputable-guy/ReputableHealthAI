Study Title: A randomized trial of behavioral interventions yielding sustained reductions in distracted driving.

Study Summary:
Distracted driving is responsible for nearly 1 million crashes each year in the United States alone, and a major source of driver distraction is handheld phone use. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of interventions designed to create sustained reductions in handheld use while driving (NCT04587609). Participants were 1,653 consenting Progressive&#xae; Snapshot&#xae; usage-based auto insurance customers ages 18 to 77 who averaged at least 2 min/h of handheld use while driving in the month prior to study invitation. They were randomly assigned to one of five arms for a 10-wk intervention period. Arm 1 (control) got education about the risks of handheld phone use, as did the other arms. Arm 2 got a free phone mount to facilitate hands-free use. Arm 3 got the mounta commitment exercise and tips for hands-free use. Arm 4 got the mount, commitment, and tipsweekly goal gamification and social competition. Arm 5 was the same as Arm 4,offered behaviorally designed financial incentives. Postintervention, participants were monitored until the end of their insurance rating period, 25 to 65 d more. Outcome differences were measured using fractional logistic regression. Arm 4 participants, who received gamification and competition, reduced their handheld use by 20.5% relative to control (< 0.001); Arm 5 participants, who additionally received financial incentives, reduced their use by 27.6% (< 0.001). Both groups sustained these reductions through the end of their insurance rating period.
