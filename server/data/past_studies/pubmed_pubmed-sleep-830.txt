Study Title: Botulinum toxin-A effects on pain, somatosensory and psychosocial features of patients with refractory masticatory myofascial pain: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.

Study Summary:
The antinociceptive effect of BoNT-A have been well documented in animal studies; however, results of few but well-designed randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials about BoNT-A efficacy in masticatory myofascial pain (MFP) are inconsistent. Therefore, the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of BoNT-A in patients with refractory MFP. Twenty-eight patients with pain reduction of less than 30% despite conservative treatment and with an average pain intensity of&#x2009;>&#x2009;50&#xa0;mm on the visual analogue scale (VAS) participated. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a total of 80&#xa0;U of BoNT-A or saline solution (SS) injected into the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles. Pain intensity (VAS), quantitative sensory testing (QST), conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and psychosocial status were examined. Follow-up was performed at 1 and 6&#xa0;months. For repeated-measure comparisons between evaluation times, Friedman test with Bonferroni correction was used for pain and somatosensory variables and the Wilcoxon test for the psychosocial variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used for all comparisons between groups. The BoNT-A group had a significant decrease in pain intensity at follow-ups compared with the SS group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). QST assessment revealed higher pressure pain threshold values in the masseter muscle for BoNT-A group compared to SS (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.03) at all follow-ups. No differences were found for mechanical pain threshold and wind-up ratio values (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05) in the entire study. The BoNT-A group presented the most efficient CPM effect (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.03) only at the 1&#xa0;month follow-up in the masseter muscle. There was a significant time effect for BoNT-A in all psychosocial variables (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and a drug effect in the Central Sensitization Inventory (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.004), and Healthy Survey 36 (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) at 6&#xa0;months follow-up. The study demonstrates that a single injection-session of BoNT-A has positive effects on the hall pain spectrum of patients with refractory masticatory myofascial pain.
