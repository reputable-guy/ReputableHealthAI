Study Title: Effect of Black Garlic Consumption on Endothelial Function and Lipid Profile: A Before-and-After Study in Hypercholesterolemic and Non-Hypercholesterolemic Subjects.

Study Summary:
Black garlic is obtained from raw garlic (L.), by a fermentation process, under humidity and heat treatment, showing a high concentration of organosulfur compounds, which have been related to benefits in the prevention or delay of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The objective of the research was to evaluate whether long-term consumption of black garlic improves endothelial function and lipid profile in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Single center, controlled clinical trial with two branches: Hypercholesterolemia vs. Healthy condition. Sixty-two subjects of both sexes were distributed in two groups, the hypercholesterolemia group (= 31) (total cholesterol (TC) range 200-300 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol range 135-175 mg/dL) and the healthy group (= 31). The intervention consisted of the ingestion of 4 cloves of black garlic (12 g) daily for 12 weeks. significant increases in Apolipoprotein (Apo)A1 occurred in both groups: Hypercholesterolemia (&#x394; 11.8 mg/dL< 0.001) vs Healthy (&#x394; 11.1 mg/dL< 0.001). Besides, significant reductions for endothelial adhesion molecules monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (&#x394; -121.5 pg/mL= 0.007 vs. &#x394; -56.3 pg/mL= 0.015), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (&#x394; -39.3 ng/mL< 0.001 vs. &#x394; 63.5 ng/mL< 0.001), and vascular cyto-adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (&#x394; -144.4 ng/mL< 0.001 vs. &#x394; -83.4 ng/mL= 0.061) were observed, for hypercholesterolemic and healthy subjects, respectively. These data show that black garlic consumption could improve some parameters related to endothelial function and lipid profile, which may have a favorable impact on the risk of CVDs, although more long-term studies are necessary to confirm.
