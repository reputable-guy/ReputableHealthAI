Study Title: Effects of qigong exercise on physical fitness and patient-reported health outcomes in lung cancer survivors.

Study Summary:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a three-month Guolin Qigong (GQ) intervention on physical fitness and patient-reported health outcomes among patients with lung cancer. This pilot study was a non-randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants who were over 18&#xa0;years of age and diagnosed with stage I-IV lung cancer were enrolled in the study and received either the GQ intervention or usual care (UC). Participants in the GQ group performed GQ at least twice a week (one&#xa0;hour per session) for three&#xa0;months. Physical fitness (chair stand, arm curl, sit and reach, back scratch, 8-foot up and go, 6-min walk test) was assessed at baseline, post-intervention, six&#xa0;months, and 12&#xa0;months. Self-reported quality of life and sleep (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and six&#xa0;months. Forty-nine participants (65% females, 59.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.0&#xa0;years old, ranging from 39 to 71&#xa0;years old) were enrolled in the study, and 25 participants completed all tests at 12-month follow-up (13 in GQ vs. 12 in UC; 68% females, 59.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.5&#xa0;years old). Compared to the UC group, results for the chair stand and arm curl tests improved significantly in the GQ group from baseline to post-intervention (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.041, respectively). Similarly, the 8-foot up and go test improved in the GQ group from baseline to post-intervention and 12&#xa0;months (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008, respectively) when compared to the UC group. Between-group analyses also revealed a statistically significant improvement in global health status/quality of life from baseline to six&#xa0;months (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018) and quality of sleep from baseline to post-intervention (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034) in favor of the GQ group. GQ had a beneficial effect on lower and upper body strength, locomotor performance (speed, agility, and balance while moving), quality of sleep, and quality of life among lung cancer survivors, but further randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings. The trial has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200059145).
