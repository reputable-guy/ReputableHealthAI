Study Title: Mindfulness-based eating awareness training versus itself plus implementation intention model: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Obesity causes many physical and mental illnesses. This study compares mindfulness-based eating awareness training (MB-EAT) versus MB-EAT plus implementation intention model for effectiveness on body mass index (BMI), weight self-efficacy, and physical activity in obese women with BMIs&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;25 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;52). In this randomized clinical trial, the participants were selected by the simple random sampling method and randomly divided into three groups. A 12-session MB-EAT of 150&#xa0;min per session was performed for experimental group I. The experimental group II received MB-EAT alone for physical activity planning and MB-EAT plus implementation intention; also, both groups were compared to the control group. Data were measured by the scales, a questionnaire, and a checklist, and the P-values are based on the results of the generalized estimating equation (GEE) test. P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001 were considered the significance level. The MB-EAT and MB-EAT&#x2009;+&#x2009;implementation intention effectiveness on the two experimental groups' BMI, weight self-efficacy, and physical activity was significantly different from the control group. In the integrated group versus the MB-EAT group, BMI, physical activity, and physical discomfort, were more effective than the weight self-efficacy subscales. Both intervention groups were effective on BMI, weight self-efficacy, and physical activity, but the integrated group's effectiveness was more. The MB-EAT effectiveness trial is theory-based, reducing weight and the psychological and behavioral consequences of overweight and obese adults. The MB-EAT&#x2009;+&#x2009;the Implementation intention model is to plan regular and daily exercise according to each individual's specific circumstances. The trial registration number: (IRCT20200919048767N1).
