Study Title: Patient-reported benefits from nabiximols treatment in multiple sclerosis-related spasticity exceed conventional measures.

Study Summary:
This prospective, multicenter, open-label, noninterventional 12-week study investigated the effectiveness and tolerability of add-on nabiximols oromucosal spray (Sativex) in the real-world setting in Germany.The main analysis set comprised 51 adult patients (49 nabiximols responders) with multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity.The mean overall goal attainment scale score (primary outcome measure) increased by 46% from baseline to week 12 (35.2 vs 51.4; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Mean gait speed was improved by 23% at 4 and 12&#xa0;weeks. Clinically meaningful improvements in mean 0-10 numerical rating scale scores for spasticity, pain, sleep quality and urinary bladder dysfunction were recorded at 4 and 12&#xa0;weeks.Nabiximols is a useful therapeutic option for patients with MS spasticity.
