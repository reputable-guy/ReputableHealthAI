Study Title: Effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as adjunctive treatment for chronic headache in adults with clinically stable systemic lupus erythematosus (SHADE): a randomised double-blind multiarm sham controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Chronic headache is a 'silent' neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus symptom with heterogeneous prevalence, potentially reaching 54.4%. It may reduce quality of life by increasing the likelihood of depression and sleep disturbance. While pharmacotherapy remains the first-line treatment, the current management is still challenging and needs other non-invasive modalities. An effective, tolerable and disease-specific treatment modality including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is considered to reduce the frequency of chronic headaches, including in SLE. Until recently, there was no standard protocol for tDCS in treating headaches. SHADE is a single-centre randomised double-blind multiarm sham-controlled trial for adults with clinically stable SLE, chronic headaches and without history of traumatic brain injury, brain infection, stroke or brain tumour. Random allocation is conducted to 88 subjects into 3 treatment groups (administration at primary motor, primary sensory and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and control group in 1:1:1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is reduced number of headache days after adjunctive tDCS. The secondary endpoints are reduced headache intensity, increased quality of life, increased sleep quality, decreased depression and reduced analgesics use. The outcome is measured monthly until 3-month postintervention using headache diary, 36-Item Short Form Survey, Chronic Headache Quality of Life Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview version 10 (MINI ICD 10). Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to determine the best tDCS electrode placement. Ethical approval had been obtained from the local Institutional Review Board of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia. Results will be published through scientific relevant peer-reviewed journals. NCT05613582.
