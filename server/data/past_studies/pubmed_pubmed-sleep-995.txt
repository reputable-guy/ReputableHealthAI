Study Title: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure but Not GLP1-mediated Weight Loss Improves Early Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Randomized Proof-of-Concept Study.

Study Summary:
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, but the benefit of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is uncertain. However, most randomized controlled trials have focused on the role of CPAP in secondary prevention, although there is growing evidence of a potential benefit on early CV disease. Weight loss in combination with CPAP may be superior but is difficult to achieve and maintain with conventional measures alone.The aim of this study was to gain insights into the effect of CPAP on early atherosclerotic processes and to compare it with a glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1-mediated weight loss regimen in patients with OSA.We performed a randomized proof-of-concept study comparing CPAP, a GLP1-mediated weight-loss regimen (liraglutide [Lir]), and both in combination for 24&#x2009;weeks in 30 consecutive patients with OSA (apnea-hypopnea index&#x2009;>15&#x2009;events/h; body mass index 30-40&#x2009;kg/m; and no history of diabetes, heart failure, or unstable CV disease). In addition to extensive evaluation for CV risk factors and endothelial function at baseline and end of study, subjects underwentF-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) for the measurement of aortic wall inflammation (target-to-background ratio) and coronary computed tomography angiography for semiautomated coronary plaque analysis.Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. CPAP alone and in combination resulted in greater reduction in apnea-hypopnea index than Lir alone (mean difference, -45 and -43 events/h, respectively, vs. -12 events/h;&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Both Lir and combination treatment led to significant weight loss, but only CPAP alone resulted in significant decrease in vascular inflammation (aortic wall target-to-background ratio from 2.03&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.34 to 1.84&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.43;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010), associated with an improvement in endothelial function and a decrease in C-reactive protein. Low-attenuation coronary artery plaque volume as a marker of unstable plaque also decreased with CPAP (from 571&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;490 to 334&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;185 mm) and with combination therapy (from 401&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;145 to 278&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;126 mm) but not with Lir.These data suggest that CPAP therapy, but not GLP1-mediated weight loss, improves vascular inflammation and reduces unstable plaque volume in patients with OSA. Further large randomized controlled studies are warranted to assess the benefit of CPAP therapy in modifying early CV disease. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04186494).
