Study Title: Value of Knowing: Health-Related Behavior Changes following Amyloid PET Results Disclosure in Mild Cognitive Impairment.

Study Summary:
Growing evidence supports the clinical utility of amyloid PET, however, whether patients at risk for dementia use knowledge of their brain amyloid status to alter their health behaviors remains unclear. To explore the effect of amyloid PET results disclosure on self-reported health behaviors in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Self-reported health behaviors were a secondary outcome of the Return of Amyloid Imaging Scan Results (RAISR) randomized clinical trial of amyloid PET results disclosure for individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Academic medical center. RAISR study participants included 82 patients with mild cognitive impairment who were 92% non-Hispanic white, 59% male, and, on average, 73 &#xb1; 8.61 years old with 16.25 &#xb1; 2.49 years of education. Participants were assigned to a scan group with the opportunity to have an amyloid PET scan and learn their results or to a control group consisting only of a mild cognitive impairment education session and no opportunity for an amyloid PET scan. A 14-item health behavior questionnaire supplemented with qualitative data from the open-ended text entries to describe "other" health behaviors and follow-up semi-structured interviews. Baseline assessments were conducted prior to group assignment. For the present analysis, 71 participants had available data and scan group participants were divided by amyloid status, creating three groups for comparison: amyloid positive, amyloid negative, and control (no scan). Over 12 months of follow-up, no significant differences were observed in lifestyle, vitamin/supplement use, stress reduction activities, cognitive stimulation, or advance directive completion. Amyloid-negative participants were less likely than controls to consider long-term care insurance (63.6% vs. 89.2%; P = .025), and to endorse behaviors classified as "other" (36.4% vs. 64.9%; P = 0.037). After adjusting for education level, gender, and Mini-Mental State Exam score, logistic regression showed that amyloid-negative patients were 74% less likely than controls to report "other" behaviors (OR = 0.26, 95% CI [0.08, 0.85], P = 0.025), and 78% less likely to consider long-term care insurance (OR= 0.22, 95% CI [0.06, 0.86], P = 0.03). Qualitative analysis of open-ended questionnaire data and supplemental interviews with scan group participants revealed "other" activities to include changes in areas like employment, driving, and residential status, and engagement in other non-medical activities (e.g., pursuing bucket lists). This exploratory analysis of health-related behavior changes following amyloid PET disclosure suggests that the value of knowing one's brain amyloid status may differ by scan result and encompass actions that focus more on maximizing quality of life than promoting cognitive health.
