Study Title: Neurocognitive effects of atypical antipsychotics in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.

Study Summary:
Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia. The effects of atypical antipsychotics on the cognitive functions of patients with first-episode schizophrenia have not been comprehensively investigated so far. This study aims to compare neurocognitive effects of risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole for first-episode schizophrenia.The study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial. 546 patients were randomly divided into three medication groups, and followed up for 1 year. Cognitive performance was evaluated with a neuropsychological test battery. The Clinical trials.gov ID of the study is NCT01057849.At 6&#x2009;months, treatment resulted in significant improvements in all three groups in most cognitive domains except verbal learning and memory. At 12&#x2009;months, three treatment groups had further improvements in three cognitive domains, but visual learning and memory performance dropped back to baseline.All three atypical antipsychotics tested in the study can potentially improve cognitive performance in first-episode schizophrenia, but no significant difference in the degree of improvement was found between drugs.
