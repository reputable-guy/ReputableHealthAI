Study Title: The effect of applying emotional intelligence components on coping strategies in adolescents with beta-thalassemia major: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Thalassemia is one of the most common genetic disorders. Patients with beta-thalassemia major confront serious clinical and psychosocial challenges in their all lives, which require coping strategies. It appears that psychological interventions are necessary to improve their coping skills. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of applying emotional intelligence components on coping strategies in adolescents with beta- thalassemia major. This randomized clinical trial study involved 60 teenagers with beta- thalassemia major who were divided equally into intervention and control groups. The experimental group participated in 9 sessions of an emotional intelligence program consisting of 90&#xa0;min, held both virtually and in person, two sessions per week. We investigated problem-focused and emotion-focused (including positive emotion-focused and negative emotion-focused) coping strategies of both groups of adolescents using the Billings and Moos questionnaire before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and one month after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21. Then, according to the research objectives, independent t-tests, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni test were used. In experimental group, the mean score of problem-focused (problem-solving, cognitive evaluation) and positive emotion-focused (social support) coping increased from (14.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.6) and (5.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5) before the intervention to (29.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.1) and (10.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.3) one month after the intervention, respectively (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). However, the mean score of emotional inhibition and somatic inhibition (negative emotion-focused) decreased from (13.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.7) and (6.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5) before the intervention to (8.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.0) and (3.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.8) one month after the intervention, respectively (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). While the mean score of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies before and one month after the intervention remained stable in the control group. Adolescents with beta-thalassemia suffer from psychosocial disorders and they also cope maladaptive with their illness. Applying emotional intelligence has improved their coping strategies. Caregivers should be encouraged to assess coping skills in teenagers with beta-thalassemia major and use methods such as emotional intelligence to improve them. Therefore, it can help these adolescents to deal effectively with stress and complications of the disease. IRCT20210521051356N1 (17/06/2021).
