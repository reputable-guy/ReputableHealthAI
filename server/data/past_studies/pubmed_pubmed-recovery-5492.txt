Study Title: Defining optimal perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing laparotomy for advanced gynecologic malignancy: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways utilize multimodal analgesia. In pathways already utilizing incisional injection of liposomal bupivacaine (ILB), we assessed the benefit of adding intrathecal opioid analgesia (ITA). In this randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in patients undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic malignancy, we allocated patients 1:1 to ILB alone versus ITA&#xa0;+&#xa0;ILB with 150 &#x3bc;g intrathecal hydromorphone. The primary endpoint was the Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score (OBAS) at 24&#xa0;h following surgery. Secondary endpoints included pain scores, intravenous opioid use, and cost of care. Demographic and surgical factors were balanced for 105 patients. For the primary endpoint, ILB alone was non-inferior to ITA&#xa0;+&#xa0;ILB (median OBAS at 24&#xa0;h of 4 vs 4; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.70). We observed a significant reduction in the need for intravenous opioids (26% vs 71%; p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and total opioid requirements (median 7.5 vs 39.3&#xa0;mg morphine equivalents, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) in the first 24&#xa0;h. Clinically relevant improvements in pain scores were identified in the first 16&#xa0;h after surgery favoring ITA&#xa0;+&#xa0;ILB. Total cost of the index episode, pharmacy costs, and costs at 30&#xa0;days were not statistically different. Using OBAS as the primary endpoint, ILB alone was non-inferior to ITA&#xa0;+&#xa0;ILB. However, important cost-neutral benefits for ITA&#xa0;+&#xa0;ILB in the first 24&#xa0;h post-operatively included lower pain scores and reduced need for intravenous opioids. These early, incremental benefits of adding ITA to ERAS bundles already utilizing ILB should be considered to optimize immediate post-operative pain.
