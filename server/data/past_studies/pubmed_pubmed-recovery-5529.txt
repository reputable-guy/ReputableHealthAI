Study Title: Study on the recovery of bladder function in patients with cervical cancer after operation by portable ultrasound combined.

Study Summary:
Postoperative urination dysfunction is a common complication after surgery in patients with cervical cancer. Portable bladder ultrasound are commonly utilized in clinical practice for measuring residual urine volume. This study aimed to the effect of bladder function training combined with portable ultrasound monitoring on bladder function recovery in patients with cervical cancer after training. A total of 40 postoperative patients with cervical cancer were randomly divided into a control group (A) and an experimental group (B) of 20 cases each. Group A was given routine postoperative care, while group B was given bladder function training. Urgent urine bladder volume were taken twice daily after removal of the urinary catheter and monitored for five consecutive days. The difference of urgent urine bladder volume and bladder filling rate were compared by-test and chi-square test respectively. The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was used to evaluate the quality of life of patients before and after intervention, and compared by Mann-Whitneytest. There was no significant difference in preoperative urgent urine volume between the two groups. After catheter removal, the bladder volume of patients in the B increased, while the bladder volume of patients in the A increased less and fluctuated greatly. The bladder filling rate in the A was significantly lower than that in the B (5/15 vs 17/18,&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). After intervention, the quality of life of the experimental group was better than that of the control group, including scores of general health, mental health, vitality, and physical role (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Postoperative cervical cancer patients trained to hold urine by portable ultrasound monitoring are able to recover bladder function.
