Study Title: Enhancement of Pulmonary Function and Reduction of Complications Through EIT-Guided Yoga Breathing Exercise After Esophagectomy.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the impact of EIT-guided yoga breathing training on postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) for esophageal cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Total of 62 patients underwent radical resections of esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer patients were randomized to the standard care group, or the intervention group receiving an additional complete breathing exercise under the guidance of EIT in AICU. Following extubation after the esophagectomy, pulmonary functions were evaluated by EIT with center of ventilation (CoV), dependent silent spaces (DSS), and non-dependent silent spaces (NSS). RESULTS Sixty-one older esophageal cancer patients (31 in the Control group and 30 in the EIT group) were included in the final analysis. Forty-four patients experienced pulmonary complications after esophagectomy, 27 (87.1%) in the Control group and 17 (36.7%) in the EIT group (RR, 0.42 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.69). The most common pulmonary complication was pleural effusion, with an incidence of 30% in the EIT group and 74.2% in the Control group, with RR of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.73). Time for the first pulmonary complication was significantly longer in the EIT group than in the Control group (hazard ratio, HR, 0.43; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.87; P=0.019). Patients in the EIT group had significantly higher scores in CoV, DSS, and NSS than in the Control group. CONCLUSIONS Guided by EIT, the addition of the postoperative breathing exercise to the standardized care during AICU could further improve pulmonary function, and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications after esophagectomy.
