Study Title: Cardiorespiratory Fitness Benefits of High-Intensity Interval Training After Stroke: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Limited evidence supports the effects of short-interval high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for improving cardiorespiratory fitness (V&#x307;Opeak) after stroke. We aimed to compare the effects of 12 weeks of short-interval HIIT versus moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on V&#x307;Opeak, cardiovascular risk factors, and mobility outcomes among individuals &#x2265;6 months poststroke. This study was a multi-site, 12-week randomized controlled trial (NCT03614585) with an 8-week follow-up. Participants were randomized into 3 d/wk of HIIT (10&#xd7;1 minute 80%-100% heart rate reserve interspersed with 1 minute 30% heart rate reserve [19 minutes]) or MICT (20-30 minutes 40%-60% heart rate reserve). Secondary outcomes of the trial, including V&#x307;Opeak, cardiovascular risk factors (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, blood pressure, and waist-hip ratio), and mobility (6-minute walk test, 10 m gait speed), were reported. Linear mixed model analyses with a group&#xd7;study time point interaction evaluated between-group differences. Of the 305 potential participants, 82 consented (mean [SD] age 64.9 [9.3] years, 32 females [39%], 1.8 [1.2] years poststroke) and were randomized to HIIT (n=42, mean [SD] baseline V&#x307;Opeak 17.3 [5.9] mL/kg&#xb7;min) or MICT (n=40, mean [SD] baseline V&#x307;Opeak 17.2 [6.0] mL/kg&#xb7;min). Participants attended 82% of visits (n=2417/2952). No adverse events occurred during the study period. A significant group&#xd7;study time point interaction was found (&#x3c7;=8.46;=0.015) for V&#x307;Opeak at 12 weeks (mean difference, 1.81 [95% CI, 0.58-3.04];=0.004) whereby the HIIT group had greater gains in V&#x307;Opeak (&#x2206;3.52 mL/kg&#xb7;min [95% CI, 2.47-4.57];<0.001) compared with the MICT group (&#x2206;1.71 mL/kg&#xb7;min [95% CI, 0.55-2.86];=0.001). There was no between-group difference in V&#x307;Opeak (mean difference, 1.08 [95% CI, -0.26 to 2.42];=0.11) at 8-week follow-up. No group&#xd7;study time point interactions were found for cardiovascular risk factors or mobility outcomes. Short-interval HIIT may be an effective alternative to MICT for improving V&#x307;Opeak at 12 weeks postintervention. URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03614585.
