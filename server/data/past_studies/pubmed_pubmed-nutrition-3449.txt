Study Title: The NUTRIENT Trial (NUTRitional Intervention among myEloproliferative Neoplasms): Results from a Randomized Phase I Pilot Study for Feasibility and Adherence.

Study Summary:
Chronic inflammation is integral to myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) pathogenesis. JAK inhibitors reduce cytokine levels, but not without significant side effects. Nutrition is a low-risk approach to reduce inflammation and ameliorate symptoms in MPN. We performed a randomized, parallel-arm study to determine the feasibility of an education-focused Mediterranean diet intervention among patients with MPN. We randomly assigned patients with MPN to either a Mediterranean diet or standard U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans (USDA). Groups received equal but separate education with registered dietician counseling and written dietary resources. Patients were prospectively followed for feasibility, adherence, and symptom burden assessments. Biological samples were collected at four timepoints during the 15-week study to explore changes in inflammatory biomarkers and gut microbiome. The Mediterranean diet was as easy to follow for patients with MPN as the standard USDA diet. Approximately 80% of the patients in the Mediterranean diet group achieved a Mediterranean Diet Adherence Score of &#x2265;8 throughout the entire active intervention period, whereas less than 50% of the USDA group achieved a score of &#x2265;8 at any timepoint. Improvement in symptom burden was observed in both diet groups. No significant changes were observed in inflammatory cytokines. The diversity and composition of the gut microbiome remained stable throughout the duration of the intervention. With dietician counseling and written education, patients with MPN can adhere to a Mediterranean eating pattern. Diet interventions may be further developed as a component of MPN care, and potentially incorporated into the management of other hematologic conditions. Diet is a central tenant of management of chronic conditions characterized by subclinical inflammation, such as cardiovascular disease, but has not entered the treatment algorithm for clonal hematologic disorders. Here, we establish that a Mediterranean diet intervention is feasible in the MPN patient population and can improve symptom burden. These findings warrant large dietary interventions in patients with hematologic disorders to test the impact of diet on clinical outcomes.
