Study Title: The web-based Pleasure&Pregnancy programme in the treatment of unexplained infertility: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Does offering the Pleasure&Pregnancy (P&P) programme rather than expectant management improve naturally conceived ongoing pregnancy rates in couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility? The P&P programme had no effect on the ongoing pregnancy rates of couples with unexplained infertility. Underpowered studies suggested that face-to-face interventions targeting sexual health may increase pregnancy rates. The impact of an eHealth sexual health programme had yet to be evaluated by a large randomized controlled trial. This is a nationwide multi-centre, unblinded, randomized controlled superiority trial (web-based randomization programme, 1:1 allocation ratio). This RCT intended to recruit 1164 couples within 3&#xa0;years but was put on hold after having included 700 couples over 5&#xa0;years (2016-2021). The web-based P&P programme contains psychosexual information and couple communication, mindfulness and sensate focus exercises aiming to help maintain or improve sexual health, mainly pleasure, and hence increase pregnancy rates. The P&P programme additionally offers information on the biology of conception and enables couples to interact online with peers and via email with coaches. Heterosexual couples with unexplained infertility and a Hunault-prognosis of at least 30% chance of naturally conceiving a live-born child within 12&#x2009;months were included, after their diagnostic work-up in 41 Dutch secondary and tertiary fertility centres. The primary outcome was an ongoing pregnancy, defined as a viable intrauterine pregnancy of at least 12&#x2009;weeks duration confirmed by an ultrasound scan, conceived naturally within 6&#xa0;months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were time to pregnancy, live birth, sexual health, and personal and relational well-being at baseline and after 3 and 6&#xa0;months. The primary analyses were according to intention-to-treat principles. We calculated relative risks (RRs, pregnancy rates) and a risk difference (RD, pregnancy rates), Kaplan-Meier survival curves (live birth over time), and time, group, and interactive effects with mixed models analyses (sexual health and well-being). Totals of 352 (one withdrawal) and 348 (three withdrawals) couples were allocated to, respectively the P&P group and the expectant management group. Web-based tracking of the intervention group showed a high attrition rate (57% of couples) and limited engagement (i.e. median of 16 visits and 33&#x2009;min total visitation time per couple). Intention-to-treat analyses showed that 19.4% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;68/351) of the P&P group and 22.6% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;78/345) of the expectant management group achieved a naturally conceived ongoing pregnancy (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.86; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.64-1.15, RD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-3.24%; 95% CI -9.28 to 2.81). The time to pregnancy did not differ between the groups (Log rank&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.23). Live birth occurred in 18.8% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;66/351) of the couples of the P&P group and 22.3% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;77/345) of the couples of the expectant management group (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.84; 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.63-1.1). Intercourse frequency decreased equally over time in both groups. Sexual pleasure, orgasm, and satisfaction of women of the P&P group improved while these outcomes remained stable in the expectant management group. Male orgasm, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction decreased over time with no differences between groups. The intervention did not affect personal and relational well-being. Non-compliance by prematurely starting medically assisted reproduction, and clinical loss to follow-up were, respectively, 15.1% and 1.4% for the complete study population. Per protocol analysis for the primary outcome did not indicate a difference between the groups. Comparing the most engaged users with the expectant management group added that coital frequency decreased less, and that male sexual desire improved in the intervention group. The intended sample size of 1164 was not reached because of a slow recruitment rate. The achieved sample size was, however, large enough to exclude an improvement of more than 8% of the P&P programme on our primary outcome. The P&P programme should not be offered to increase natural pregnancy rates but may be considered to improve sexual health. The attrition from and limited engagement with the P&P programme is in line with research on other eHealth programmes and underlines the importance of a user experience study.
