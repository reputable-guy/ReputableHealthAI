Study Summary:
Mindfulness meditation has been shown to alleviate pain and may be an appealing adjunctive pain management option.To compare measures of pain, mindfulness, and opioid usage, and collect evaluative feedback among patients undergoing septorhinoplasty with and without guided meditation.Patients undergoing septorhinoplasty were randomized to online-guided meditation postoperative days 0-3 versus standard care; all received the same pain medications. Primary outcome measures included pain intensity, opioid consumption, mindfulness scores, and evaluative feedback.Twenty-one patients received guided meditation and 24 received standard care. No significant difference in opioid consumption or pain scores was seen with the exception of higher opioid use in patients with intranasal splints in the standard care group. Twenty out of 21 patients provided evaluative feedback; all recommended mindfulness meditation to friends undergoing nasal surgery, 90% reported it was beneficial, 85% believed it eased pain/discomfort, and 80% believed it aided with sleep.Although no objective difference was found in opioid consumption or pain scores, most patients reported that guided mindfulness meditation was beneficial to their recovery following septorhinoplasty.
