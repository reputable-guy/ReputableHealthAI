Study Title: Ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block versus thoracic epidural block for postoperative analgesia in pediatric Nuss surgery: a randomized noninferiority trial.

Study Summary:
Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) is often used for analgesia after thoracic surgery. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) has been proposed to provide adequate analgesia. We hypothesized that ESPB would be noninferior to TEA as a part of multimodal analgesia in pediatric patients undergoing the Nuss procedure. Patients aged 7-18&#xa0;years and scheduled for the Nuss procedure were randomly allocated to receive bilateral single-shot ESPB or TEA and a multimodal analgesic regimen including parent-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). At 6&#xa0;h, 12&#xa0;h, 18&#xa0;h, and 24&#xa0;h postoperatively, pain was evaluated using the numeric rating scale (NRS) and opioid consumption was assessed by counting the number of PCIA boluses. The joint primary outcomes were the average pain score and opioid consumption at 24&#xa0;h after surgery. The secondary outcomes were the NRS scores and the number of opioid boluses administered at different postoperative time points, adverse events, and recovery quality. Three hundred patients underwent randomization, and 286 received ESPB (147 patients) or TEA (139 patients). At 24&#xa0;h postoperatively, ESPB was noninferior to TEA in terms of the average NRS score (mean difference,&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.1, 95% confidence interval [CI],&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.3-0.1, margin&#x2009;=&#x2009;1, P for noninferiority&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and the number of opioid boluses administered (mean difference,&#x2009;-&#x2009;1.1, 95% CI,&#x2009;-&#x2009;2.8-0.6, margin&#x2009;=&#x2009;7, P for noninferiority&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Adverse events and patient recovery were comparable between groups. The results demonstrate that combined with a multimodal analgesia, ESPB provides noninferior analgesia compared to TEA with respect to pain score and opioid consumption among pediatric patients undergoing the Nuss procedure.
