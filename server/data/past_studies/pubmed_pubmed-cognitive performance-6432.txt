Study Title: Eight weeks of intermittent fasting versus calorie restriction does not alter eating behaviors, mood, sleep quality, quality of life and cognitive performance in women with overweight.

Study Summary:
Human trials that compare intermittent fasting (IF) to calorie restriction (CR) with psychological, behavioral and cognition outcomes are limited. We hypothesized that there would be no difference between CR and IF on perceived eating behaviors, mood, sleep quality, quality of life (QOL) and cognition in women with overweight and obesity. In this prespecified secondary analysis of an open-label, single center, parallel assignment, randomized controlled trial, healthy women with overweight or obesity (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;46, mean [SD] age 50 [9] years, BMI 32.9 [4.4] kg/m), without a diagnosed eating disorder and who were randomized into 2 weight loss groups (prescribed 70% of calculated energy requirements as IF or CR) were included. Measurements were assessed in both IF and CR groups following a 12-hour overnight fast during baseline and week 8 and additionally following a 24-hour fast in the IF group only at week 8. We observed that IF produced greater weight and body fat loss than CR (P < .001). We did not detect any statistical difference between groups for the change in dietary restraint, disinhibition, hunger, mood, sleep quality, and QOL. An increase in cognitive performance was found in both IF (P = .036) and CR (P = .006) groups in one of the cognitive tasks, but there was no statistical difference between groups. Perceived eating behaviors, mood, sleep quality and cognitive performance were not changed by an acute 24-hour fast within the IF group (all P > .05). IF may be a viable alternative to CR for weight loss, in the short-term, without adversely impacting eating behaviors, mood, sleep quality, QOL or cognition in healthy women with overweight or obesity. However, larger and long term trials are required.
