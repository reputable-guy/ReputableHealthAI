Study Title: Overcoming Compassion Fatigue and Burnout in Pediatric Oncology Nurses: Implementation of a Staff Well-Being Program.

Study Summary:
As frontline healthcare workers, pediatric oncology nurses are at high risk for burnout, compassion fatigue, and decreased compassion satisfaction. Research indicates that up to 60% of oncology staff experience some form of burnout. This can lead to difficulties in personal and professional relationships, decreased staff retention, and negative effects on patient safety. This evidence-based practice project evaluated the impact of a staff well-being program on pediatric oncology nurses in a 28-bed hematology-oncology unit at a children's hospital.After reviewing the literature related to compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue, burnout, and well-being, an interdisciplinary team identified best practices for implementing a staff well-being program. This program integrated the components of Code Lavender, which is an alert designed to reduce stress and provide psychological first aid, including social support and a purposeful break from the unit, with staff debriefings, or dedicated time to reflect and focus on the team's emotional response and coping strategies.Nurses reported that Code Lavender met their expectations; 69% agreed or strongly agreed that it had an immediate positive impact on their well-being. The team experienced challenges in coordinating debriefings with consistency, so the process was modified to develop a format that would address the needs of those who access the well-being program. There was a marginally significant improvement in compassion satisfaction from baseline to 12 months (=&#x2009;.05).Promoting healthcare worker well-being continues to be a priority to reduce burnout and to improve compassion satisfaction. Implementation of Code Lavender and debriefings is an important step toward improving the well-being of pediatric oncology nurses.
