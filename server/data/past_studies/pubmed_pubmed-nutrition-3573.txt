Study Title: Neurodevelopmental Outcome in Very Preterm Infants Randomised to Receive Two Different Standardised, Concentrated Parenteral Nutrition Regimens.

Study Summary:
We have previously shown that increasing parenteral protein (target: 3.8 versus 2.8 g/kg/d) and energy (12% versus 10% glucose; 3.8 versus 2.8 g/kg/d) intake using a Standardised, Concentrated with Added Macronutrients Parenteral (SCAMP) nutrition regimen ameliorates early head growth failure in very-preterm infants (VPIs). We hypothesised that the SCAMP nutrition regimen would also improve neurodevelopmental outcome. The original double-blind randomised, controlled study (ISRCTN: 76597892) received ethical approval. VPIs were randomised to either start SCAMP or remain on the control regimen. The consent process included neurodevelopmental assessments (Bayley III), all of which were performed (blinded) at 2-3.5 years of corrected gestational age. Bayley III assessments were performed for 38/60 SCAMP survivors and 41/63 control survivors at means of (sd) 29.2 (3.7) and 20.0 (3.9) months, respectively. Motor, cognitive, language, and combined scores were all higher in the SCAMP intervention group, but none of the differences were statistically significant. Nutrient intake and biochemical monitoring data confirmed that protein/energy ratios were maintained in the SCAMP intervention group without increasing the incidence of hyperglycaemia, insulin treatment, or the derangement of plasma mineral/electrolyte levels. This study did not show a statistically significant improvement in neurodevelopmental outcome when administering higher parenteral protein/energy intakes despite optimal energy and mineral intakes.
