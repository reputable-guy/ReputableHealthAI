Study Title: An open trial of biofeedback for long COVID.

Study Summary:
Biofeedback is a therapeutic treatment model that teaches self-regulation of autonomic functions to alleviate stress-related symptoms. "Long COVID" refers to chronic physical and cognitive sequelae post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study examined the efficacy of a six-week intervention, consisting of weekly one-hour sessions combining heart rate variability and temperature biofeedback, for alleviating mood symptoms, somatic symptoms and sleep disturbance of patients diagnosed with long COVID. Data were collected from 20 adult participants aged 22-63 (M&#xa0;=&#xa0;44.1, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.2) with varying long COVID symptoms. Within this single arm design, 16 of the 20 participants completed all six sessions of biofeedback; 14 completed an assessment at the three-month post-treatment time point. Participants self-reported significant improvements in somatic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, sleep quality, quality of life, and number of "bad days" immediately after the intervention and three months later (Cohen's d effect size (ES)&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.09-0.46). Reduced number of medical doctor visits (ES&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.85) and prescription drug use over the last month (odds ratio&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.33), as well as improved emotional wellbeing (ES&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.97) were observed at the three-month time point only. Results suggest that this short, readily scalable intervention can be potentially efficacious in alleviating symptoms of long COVID. Despite notable improvements, the major limitation of this study is its lack of control group. While a randomized trial merits study, biofeedback appears to be a brief, effective, non-invasive, and low-cost treatment option for patients with chronic somatic symptoms secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. govID: NCT05120648.
