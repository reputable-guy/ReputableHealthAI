Study Title: Aerobic exercise training and neurocognitive function in cognitively normal older adults: A one-year randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Current evidence is inconsistent on the benefits of aerobic exercise training for preventing or attenuating age-related cognitive decline in older adults. To investigate the effects of a 1-year progressive, moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise intervention on cognitive function, brain volume, and cortical thickness in sedentary but otherwise healthy older adults. We randomized 73 older adults to a 1-year aerobic exercise or stretching-and-toning (active control) program. The primary outcome was a cognitive composite score calculated from eight neuropsychological tests encompassing inductive reasoning, long-term and working memory, executive function, and processing speed. Secondary outcomes were brain volume and cortical thickness assessed by MRI, and cardiorespiratory fitness measured by peak oxygen uptake (VO). One-year aerobic exercise increased peak VOby &#x223c;10% (p < 0.001) while it did not change with stretching (p = 0.241). Cognitive composite scores increased in both the aerobic and stretching groups (p < 0.001 for time effect), although no group difference was observed. Total brain volume (p < 0.001) and mean cortical thickness (p = 0.001) decreased in both groups over time, while the reduction in hippocampal volume was smaller in the stretching group compared with the aerobic group (p = 0.040 for interaction). Across all participants, improvement in peak VOwas positively correlated with increases in cognitive composite score (r = 0.282, p = 0.042) and regional cortical thickness at the inferior parietal lobe (p = 0.016). One-year aerobic exercise and stretching interventions improved cognitive performance but did not prevent age-related brain volume loss in sedentary healthy older adults. Cardiorespiratory fitness gain was positively correlated with cognitive performance and regional cortical thickness.
