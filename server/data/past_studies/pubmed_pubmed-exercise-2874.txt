Study Title: Impact of probiotic supplementation on exercise endurance among nonelite athletes: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel trial investigated whether generally healthy adult, nonelite runners would have a greater time-to-exhaustion during submaximal treadmill running with probiotic versus placebo supplementation. It was hypothesized that the probiotic would impact training progression by reducing gastrointestinal (GI) and cold/flu symptoms. Participants who typically ran &#x2265;24&#xa0;km/week, ran or cross-trained 3-5 days per week, and had a maximal oxygen intake (V&#x307;Omax) in the 60-85th percentile were enrolled. V&#x307;Omax was used to establish individualized workload settings (85% of V&#x307;Omax) for the submaximal endurance tests at baseline and following 6 weeks of supplementation with a probiotic (Lafti L10, 5&#xd7;10CFU/capsule/day) or placebo. Participants self-reported GI and cold/flu symptoms and physical activity via daily and weekly questionnaires. Outcomes were tested using a linear model to determine if mean response values adjusted for baseline differed between groups. Twenty-eight participants (&#xa0;=&#xa0;14/group), aged 25&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5 years (mean&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;SD) with a body mass index of 23 &#xb1; 3&#xa0;kg/m, completed the study. At the final visit the probiotic group had a lower time-to-exhaustion versus the placebo group (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01) due to an increase in time-to-exhaustion with the placebo (1344&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;188 to 1565&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;219 s,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01) with no change with the probiotic (1655&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;230 to 1547&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;215 s,&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.23). During the intervention, the probiotic group completed fewer aerobic training sessions per week (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) and trained at a lower intensity (&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007) versus the placebo group. Few GI and cold/flu symptoms were reported with no differences between groups. Time-to-exhaustion increased in the placebo group, possibly due to differences in training habits.
