Study Title: Testosterone and resistance training improved physical performance and reduced fatigue in frail older men: 1 year follow-up of a randomized clinical&#xa0;trial.

Study Summary:
To improve health conditions among hypogonadal men &#x2265;70&#x2009;years of age using testosterone undecanoate (TU) injections, progressive strength training, and oral supplements of vitamin D, calcium, and protein. This study is a 1-year follow-up of a double-blind RCT lasting 20&#x2009;weeks, including 148 older men &#x2265;70&#x2009;years old with low testosterone levels and mobility problems. During 52&#x2009;weeks, 4 groups received either testosterone therapy (TU) or progressive resistance training (Training), both (Combo), or no intervention (Controls). Physiotherapists supported the training groups until week 20, while these participants continued trained on their own during weeks 21 to 52. The main outcome measure was the 30-s chair stand test. The following numbers of participants completed the trial: 20 (Combo), 20 (Controls), 24 (TU), and 14 (Training). When examining 30-s chair stand test performance within each group at baseline, and at weeks 4, 20 and 52, only the Combo group improved (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, Friedman Test). Compared to controls, only the Combo group experienced reduced fatigue and tiredness (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Fifty-two weeks of testosterone supplementation combined with progressive resistance training may enhance physical performance, alleviate fatigue, and had no notable detrimental impacts among males aged &#x2265;70 suffering from mobility issues and testosterone insufficiency.Clinical Trials NCT02873559.
