Study Title: Effect of repeated sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation on subjective and objective measures of recovery and performance in soccer players following a soccer match simulation.

Study Summary:
We investigated the effect of repeated sessions of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) on subjective and objective measures of recovery, cognitive and sport-specific performance in professional soccer players following a soccer match simulation (SMS). Sixteen soccer players participated in this randomized, crossover, and sham-controlled study. They completed baseline assessments of well-being, total quality recovery (TQR), electromyographic activity (EMG) of the thigh muscles, countermovement jump (CMJ), and cognitive and Loughborough soccer passing test (LSPT) skills. Then, the participants engaged in an SMS routine (2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;45&#xa0;min, 15-min intervals). There was no significant difference in rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during the SMS in the anodal (17.25&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.85) and sham (16.93&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.92) conditions (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.19). Following the SMS, the participants were randomized to receive three sessions of a-tDCS (2&#xa0;mA, 20&#xa0;min,&#x2009;+F3/-F4) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or sham immediately after, 24&#xa0;h, and 48&#xa0;h after the SMS. Finally, the same outcome measures were evaluated 24 and 48&#xa0;h following the SMS. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed that a-tDCS stimulation improved passing skills (decreased time to perform the LSPT and number of errors; all ps&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01; d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.56-2.9) and increased the feeling of well-being (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02; d&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.8), with no effect on TQR, cognitive performance, CMJ performance, and EMG. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate, for the first time, that repeated a-tDCS could be used as an adjunct method to accelerate soccer players' well-being and technical performance recovery, particularly after congested matches and/or training sessions. These findings may also be applicable to other team sports with characteristics similar to soccer (e.g., futsal, handball, basketball, etc.).
