Study Title: Three-arm clinical trial of improved flour targeting intestinal microbiota (MALINEA).

Study Summary:
The main objective of this project was to compare in the field conditions two strategies of re-nutrition of children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) aged from 6 to 24 months, targeting the microbiota in comparison with a standard regimen. A three-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomised trial was conducted in four countries (Niger, CAR, Senegal and Madagascar). Children received for 12 weeks either fortified blended flour (FBF control)&#x2009;=&#x2009;arm 1, or FBF&#x2009;+&#x2009;azithromycin (oral suspension of 20&#x2009;mg/kg/day daily given with a syringe) for the first 3 days at inclusion&#x2009;=&#x2009;arm 2 or mix FBF with inulin/fructo-oligosaccharides (6&#x2009;g/day if age &#x2265;12 months and 4&#x2009;g if age <12 months)&#x2009;=&#x2009;arm 3. For each arm, children aged from 6 to 11 months received 100&#x2009;g x 2 per day of flours and those aged from 12 to 24 months received 100&#x2009;g &#xd7; 3 per day of FBF. The primary endpoint was nutritional recovery, defined by reaching a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ)&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;-1.5 within 12 weeks. Overall, 881 children were randomised (297, 290 and 294 in arm 1, arm 2 and arm 3, respectively). Three hundred and forty-four children were males (39%) and median/mean age were 14.6/14.4 months (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.9, IQR&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.5-18.4). At inclusion, the three arms were comparable for all criteria, but differences were observed between countries. Overall, 44% (390/881) of the children recovered at week 12 from MAM, with no significant difference between the three arms (41.4%, 45.5% and 45.9%, in arm 1, arm 2 and arm 3, respectively, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.47). This study did not support the true advantages of adding a prebiotic or antibiotic to flour. When using a threshold of WHZ&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;-2 as an exploratory endpoint, significant differences were observed between the three arms, with higher success rates in arms with antibiotics or prebiotics compared to the control arm (66.9%, 66.0% and 55.2%, respectively, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005).
