Study Title: The effect of individualized nutrition training of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) on their growth and development a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the effectiveness of individualized nutrition training for mothers of children who underwent congenital heart disease (CHD) surgery on their children's growth and development. The researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial at &#xc7;ukurova University Medical Faculty Balcal&#x131; Hospital in Adana, Turkey, between January 20th, 2021, and June 30th, 2021. They recruited 42 children with CHD and their families. Researchers used a personal information form, growth parameter measurements, and the Ankara Developmental Screening Inventory to assess the children. Participants were randomly divided into three groups. Control group, received standard care. Experimental group 1 (orally fed), received family-centered care and individualized nutrition training focused on age-appropriate food content, preparation methods, and meeting children's caloric needs. Experimental group 2 (orally and nutritionally fed), received the same interventions as group 1. The training programs for the experimental groups included information on strengthening breast milk and additional nutritional nutrition support. The training programs for the experimental groups likely addressed feeding challenges specific to children with CHD. The study found a statistically significant difference in weight gain between the first and third follow-ups within the training group (children who received individualized nutrition education). This suggests that the training may have positively impacted weight gain. Additionally, the children in the training groups who were breastfed for longer than 12 months had better growth parameters and developmental scores compared to those with shorter breastfeeding durations. This study suggests that individualized nutrition training for mothers of children with CHD surgery may support their children's growth and development, particularly when combined with prolonged breastfeeding.
