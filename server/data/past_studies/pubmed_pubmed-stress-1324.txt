Study Title: Polyphenol-Rich Cranberry Beverage Positively Affected Skin Health, Skin Lipids, Skin Microbiome, Inflammation, and Oxidative Stress in Women in a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to determine whether a polyphenol-rich cranberry beverage affects skin properties, lipids, and the microbiome in women using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Twenty-two women with Fitzpatrick skin types 2-3 were randomized to drink a cranberry beverage or placebo for six weeks. After a 21-day washout, they consumed the opposite beverage for six weeks. Six weeks of cranberry beverage significantly reduced UVB-induced erythema, improved net elasticity on the face and forearm, smoothness on the face, and gross elasticity on the forearm compared to the placebo. When stratified by age, these effects of the cranberry beverage were primarily observed in women >40 years old. SOD activities were improved after six weeks of cranberry beverage consumption compared to the placebo, while glutathione peroxide and TNF-&#x3b1; were improved compared to baseline. These effects were found to differ by age group. Skin lipid composition was modulated by both the cranberry beverage and the placebo. Cranberry beverages did not change &#x3b1;- or &#x3b2;-diversity but altered the abundance of several skin microbes at the species and strain level. Consumption of a cranberry beverage for six weeks improved specific skin properties and oxidative stress and modulated skin lipids and microbiome compared to placebo.
