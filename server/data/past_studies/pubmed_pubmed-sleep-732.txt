Study Title: System-level recommendations for improved wellness for gynecologic oncologists: A Society of Gynecologic Oncology Review.

Study Summary:
Burnout and its negative sequelae are a persistent problem in gynecologic oncology, threatening the health of our physician workforce. Individual-level interventions such as stress management training, physical activity, and sleep hygiene only partially address this widespread, systemic crisis rooted in the extended work hours and stressful situations associated with gynecologic oncology practice. There is an urgent need for systematic, institution-level changes to allow gynecologic oncologists to continue the crucial work of caring for people with gynecologic cancer. We present recommendations for institution-level changes which are grounded in the framework presented by the National Plan for Health Workforce Well-Being by the National Academy of Medicine. These are aimed at facilitating gynecologic oncologists' well-being and reduction of burnout. Recommendations include efforts to create a more positive and inclusive work environment, decrease administrative barriers, promote mental health, optimize electronic medical record use, and support a diverse workforce. Implementation and regular evaluation of these interventions, with specific attention to at-risk groups, is an important next step.
