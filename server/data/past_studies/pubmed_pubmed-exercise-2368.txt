Study Title: The effects of balance training in patients with total hip arthroplasty : A&#xa0;randomized controlled pilot study.

Study Summary:
Total hip arthroplasty (THA) causes damage to hip joint mechanoceptors, which in turn leads to decrease in proprioception and increase in balance disorders. Few research has focused on balance training in patients with arthroplasty and none investigated the long-term effect of balance training using objective balance assessment methods in THA patients. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of balance training in patients with THA until 26 weeks postoperatively. For this study 24 patients with hip osteoarthritis, who were candidates for THA were recruited. Of the patients with THA 16&#xa0;completed the study protocol and the patients were randomized to 2&#xa0;groups: conventional rehabilitation (CR, n&#x202f;=&#x2009;8) or conventional rehabilitation plus balance training (CR&#x202f;+&#x2009;BT, n&#x202f;=&#x2009;8). The CR group completed typical surgery-specific exercise programs, while the CR&#x202f;+&#x2009;BT group completed the CR plus balance exercises. The patients were evaluated by a&#xa0;hand-held dynamometer, single leg stance test (SLST), Tetrax balance system, Harris hip score, lower extremity function scale, 5&#xa0;times sit to stand test and 50-foot timed walk test preoperatively and 8, 14 and 26 weeks postoperatively. While the CR&#x202f;+&#x2009;BT group showed significant improvement for the right extremity eyes closed SLST score (p&#x202f;<&#x2009;0.05), there was no significant difference for other assessment parameters between the CR and CR&#x202f;+&#x2009;BT groups (p&#x202f;>&#x2009;0.05). There were significant improvements in both groups until 26 weeks following THA (p&#x202f;<&#x2009;0.05). The results of our study indicate that there were similar improvements in the balance and functional parameters in the CR and CR&#x202f;+&#x2009;BT groups. There was no additional benefit after 26 weeks of controlled balance exercises following THA.
