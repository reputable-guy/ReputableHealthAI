Study Title: An Intensive Culinary Intervention Programme to Promote Healthy Ageing: The SUKALMENA-InAge Feasibility Pilot Study.

Study Summary:
Dietary interventions are a key strategy to promote healthy ageing. Cooking skills training emerges as a promising approach to acquiring and maintaining healthy eating habits. The purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of a culinary programme to improve healthy eating habits among overweight/obese adults (55-70 years old). A total of 62 volunteers were randomly (1:1) assigned to an culinary intervention group (CIG) or a nutritional intervention group (NIG). Dietary, cooking, and health-related outcomes, including body advanced glycation end product (AGE) levels, were evaluated at baseline and after four weeks. Mixed-effects linear models were used to assess the effects of the interventions within and between groups. Among the 56 participants who completed the trial, CIG participants achieved a significant improvement in Mediterranean diet adherence (1.2; 95%CI, 0.2 to 2.2) and a reduction in the use of culinary techniques associated with a higher AGE formation in foods (-2.8; 95%CI, -5.6 to -0.2), weight (-1.5; 95%CI, -2.5 to -0.5), body mass index (-0.5; 95%CI, -0.8 to -0.2), waist circumference (-1.4; 95%CI, -2.6 to -0.2), and hip circumference (-1.4; 95%CI, -2.4 to -0.4) compared with the NIG participants. Although a greater confidence in cooking in the CIG was found, attitudes and cooking habits did not improve. No significant differences in biochemical parameters or AGEs were found between groups. In conclusion, a culinary intervention could be successful in promoting healthy eating and cooking habits compared to a programme based on nutrition education alone. Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to strengthen attitudes and beliefs about home cooking, to address potential barriers and understand the impact of cooking interventions on biological parameters. Larger studies with longer follow-ups are needed to evaluate the relationship between cooking, diet, and health.
