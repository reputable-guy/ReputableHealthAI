Study Title: Evaluating the impact of adjunct bright light therapy on subjective sleep quality in major depressive disorder.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbances are a fundamental feature of depression, with their persistence after remission serving as a key risk factor for recurrence of depressive episodes, suicide, and hypnotics abuse. Though Adjunct Bright Light Therapy (BLT) has shown efficacy in treating depression by improving sleep duration and timing, its impact on subjective sleep quality remains underexplored. This study investigates the effect of adjunct BLT on the subjective experience of sleep quality of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) inpatients. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken with 100 MDD consecutively admitted inpatients on consistent antidepressant regimens. Participants were divided into two groups; Group A, received pharmacotherapy augmented with BLT, Group B, received pharmacotherapy alone. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale assessed depressive symptoms, while the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) evaluated subjective sleep quality. While both groups displayed enhanced depressive symptomatology, only Group A manifested significant improvement in perceived sleep quality (PSQI scores: A T0 8.05&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.07 vs. T1 5.64&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.64, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001; B T0 7.11&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.17 vs. T1 6.50&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.04, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.072). Study limitations include its single-site design, lack of objective sleep measurement, and exclusive SSRI use, suggesting caution in generalizing findings. Further, the absence of placebo control and unmeasured expectancy effects may influence treatment outcomes. These findings underscore the criticality of subjective sleep quality in clinical evaluations and highlight the potential of adjunct BLT as an augmentation therapeutic strategy to ameliorate sleep perception in MDD patients, emphasizing its potential role in enhancing therapeutic outcomes.
