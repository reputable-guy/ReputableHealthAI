Study Title: Addition of progesterone to feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy in transgender individuals for breast development: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) for transgender individuals traditionally includes estradiol and androgen deprivation. Research has demonstrated that breast size as a result of GAHT in transgender women is often limited. Therefore, transgender women often choose to undergo breast augmentation surgery. Progesterone is important for breast development in cisgender women during puberty. A potential role for progesterone in breast development in transgender women has not been investigated in a randomized controlled experimental set-up. The primary objective of this study is to explore the effects on breast volume of addition of oral progesterone to GAHT with estradiol in transgender women after vaginoplasty or orchiectomy. Secondary objectives include assessment of safety, satisfaction, mood, sleep and sexual pleasure. This is a non-blinded, non-placebo, randomized controlled trial using a factorial design in adult transgender individuals assigned male sex at birth who have undergone GAHT for at least one year and underwent vaginoplasty or orchiectomy. The study design allows for rapid assessment of potential synergistic effects of various dose combinations of estradiol and progesterone on breast volume change: Ninety participants will be randomized into six groups of 15 subjects each, receiving either the baseline dose of estradiol, the baseline dose of estradiol and progesterone 200&#xa0;mg daily, the baseline dose of estradiol and progesterone 400&#xa0;mg daily, twice the baseline dose of estradiol, twice the baseline dose of estradiol and progesterone 200&#xa0;mg daily or twice the baseline dose of estradiol and progesterone 400&#xa0;mg daily, all for a duration of 12 months. The main study parameters include changes in breast volume as determined by 3D measurements. Participants will be followed-up with laboratory testing including serum progesterone concentrations as well as surveys for satisfaction, mood, sleep quality and sexual pleasure. This study will indicate whether progesterone is safe and of additional value with regard to breast volume change in transgender individuals receiving feminizing GAHT. The results of this study will be useful for innovation of feminizing GAHT.
