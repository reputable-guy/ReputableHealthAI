Study Title: Comparing the Efficacy of Digital and In-Person Weight Loss Interventions for Patients with Obesity and Glycemic Disorders: Evidence from a Randomized Non-Inferiority Trial.

Study Summary:
Digital weight loss interventions present a viable and cost-effective alternative to traditional therapy. However, further evidence is needed to establish the equal effectiveness of both approaches. This randomized controlled non-inferiority trial aimed to compare the effects of an intensive in-person weight loss intervention program with Vitadio digital therapy. One hundred patients with obesity and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or insulin resistance were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. Over a 6-month period, the control group received five in-person consultations with a physician who specialized in obesity treatment, a dietitian and/or a nutrition nurse, while the intervention group followed the digital program based on a multimodal therapeutic approach. The extent of weight loss was assessed and compared between the groups. Additionally, changes in body composition and metabolic parameters for the digital intervention group were analyzed. The study results demonstrated comparable effectiveness of both treatments for weight reduction. The positive effects of Vitadio were further evidenced by favorable changes in body composition and lipid metabolism and improved glycemic control in the intervention group. These findings suggest that Vitadio is an effective tool for assisting patients with managing obesity and preventing diabetes progression.
