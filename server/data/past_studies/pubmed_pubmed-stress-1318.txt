Study Title: Effectiveness of the mom supports mom peer support intervention in treating antenatal mental health difficulties in women.

Study Summary:
Up to 75 % of at-risk perinatal women do not receive treatment in Czechia. Pregnant women with mental health difficulties are more likely to undergo less controversial nonpharmaceutical treatment during pregnancy, but structural and psychological barriers interfere with their capacity to seek professional help. We tested the effectiveness of the telephone-based peer support intervention Mom Supports Mom (MSM) in Czech pregnant women at risk of mental disorder. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess risk in women (EPDS &#x2265; 10). Women at risk were randomized into two groups; the intervention group received the MSM, while the control group received the care as usual, which did not contain any psychological support intervention. One month after completing the EPDS, the women's mental statuses were again measured and compared, this time with data before and after the intervention, using the Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale (PASS) to measure anxiety, the EPDS to measure depression, the Prenatal Psychosocial Profile (PPP) to measure stress, and the Prenatal Attachment Inventory - Revised (PAI-R) to measure attachment. The trial was registered under the name Pregnancy without psychosocial stress (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04853693). A total of 167 women were included in the study and randomized into two groups. Depressive symptoms did not decrease (Cohen&#xb4;s d; 95 % CI = 0.48; 0.17-0.79; p = .002), but levels of anxiety (Cohen&#xb4;s d; 95 % CI = 0.44; 0.13-0.75; p = .005) and psychosocial stress (Cohen&#xb4;s d; 95 % CI = 0.55; 0.20-0.82; p = .002) were reduced in women in the intervention group compared with women in the control. In addition, prenatal attachment increased among intervened women (Cohen&#xb4;s d; 95 % CI = 0.48; 0.17-0.79; p = .002). The telephone-based peer support intervention MSM is effective in reducing stress and anxiety and increasing prenatal attachment but does not reduce depression among high-risk women.
