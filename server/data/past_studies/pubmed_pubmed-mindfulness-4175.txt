Study Title: Using a Biofeedback-Based Mindfulness Practice System to Enhance Mindfulness and Alleviate Anxiety in College Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
College students experience intense anxiety, for which biofeedback mindfulness techniques show effectiveness in relief. However, typical biofeedback products often lead to user fatigue and boredom because of a single or fixed feedback and lack of focus on mindfulness enhancement.In this research, we developed Mindjourney, a VR-based respiratory feedback mindfulness system, designed to enhance mindfulness and alleviate anxiety through continuous/noncontinuous feedback and nonjudgmental reward/punishment for self-perception and attention management. A randomized controlled trial involved 72 college students, split equally into short-term (= 34, age: 23.11&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.729) and 4-week long-term (= 38, age: 24.12&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.408) groups, with equal randomization for intervention and control groups. Pre/postintervention tests were measured by using Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) for long-term groups and Galvanic Skin Response and State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) for short-term groups.Results showed that the long-term intervention group showed a significant increase in mindfulness (= 0.001 for FFMQ total score). Furthermore,andsubscales showed significant increase after intervention (= 0.034 for,< 0.001 for) compared with the control group. Both intervention groups demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety levels compared with the control groups (= 0.049 for SAI,= 0.01 for TAI). Moreover, participants expressed high interest in this biofeedback mindfulness system and willingness for long-term usage.The proposed biofeedback mindfulness practice system could potentially facilitate mindfulness practice and serve as a convenient tool for anxiety relief in campus college students.
