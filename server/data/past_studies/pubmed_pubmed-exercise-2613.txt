Study Title: Comparison of Outcomes of Physical Therapy Exercises Combined with Either a Video-Based Smartphone Application System or a Written Exercise Program Handout in 34 Patients with Non-Specific Neck Pain.

Study Summary:
BACKGROUND An exercise program was developed using risk factors for non-specific neck pain. This study aimed to compare the effects video-based versus image- and text-based remote home training performed using this exercise program in patients with non-specific neck pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS Among the 37 patients with non-specific neck pain recruited, 34 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. The participants were randomized into the experimental (n=17) and control (n=17) groups. The patients in the experimental group performed exercises using a video-based application system, whereas those in the control group performed exercises using an image- and text-based printout. In-home training was implemented for 6 weeks in both groups. The neck pain intensity, disability index, active range of motion (aROM), forward head posture (FHP), and compensatory neck flexion were measured before and after the intervention. The within-group and between-group differences were analyzed at the end of the interventions. RESULTS Improvements in pain intensity, cervical ROM, disability index, FHP, and compensatory neck flexion were observed after in-home training in the experimental group (P.05). Between-group comparison revealed that the experimental group exhibited greater improvement in pain intensity, cervical ROM, and FHP than the control group (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest that the video-based home exercise program improved pain intensity, aROM, neck disability index, FHP, and compensatory neck flexion in patients with non-specific neck pain.
