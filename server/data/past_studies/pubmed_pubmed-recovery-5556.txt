Study Title: A randomized translational study on protein- and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscles evaluated by gene-ontology, following preoperative oral carbohydrate loading compared to overnight peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) before major cancer surgery.

Study Summary:
Effects of preoperative drinks on muscle metabolism are unclear despite general recommendations. The aim of the present study was therefore to compare metabolic effects of a preoperative oral nutrition drink, recommended by protocols for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), compared to overnight preoperative peripheral total parenteral nutrition (PPN) on skeletal muscle metabolism in patients aimed at major gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Patients were randomized, based on diagnosis and clinical characteristics, to receive either a commercial carbohydrate-rich nutrition drink (Drink); or overnight (12&#xa0;h) peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) as study regimens; compared to isotone Ringer-acetate as Control regimen. Arterial blood- and abdominal muscle tissue specimens were collected at start of surgery. Blood chemistry included substrate- and hormone concentrations. Muscle mRNA transcript analyses were performed by microarray and evaluated for changes in gene activities by Gene Ontology algorithms. Patient groups were comparable in all measured preoperative assessments. The Nutrition Drink had significant metabolic alterations on muscle glucose metabolism (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), without any significant effects on amino acid- and protein metabolism. PPN showed similar significant effects on glucose metabolism as Drinks (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), but indicated also major positive effects on amino acid- (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and protein anabolism (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), particularly by inhibition of muscle protein degradation, related to both ubiquitination of proteins and autophagy/lysosome pathways (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Conventional overnight preoperative PPN seems effective to induce and support improved muscle protein metabolism in patients aimed at major cancer surgery while preoperative oral carbohydrate loading, according to ERAS-protocols, was ineffective to improve skeletal muscle catabolism and should therefore not be recommended before major cancer surgery.
