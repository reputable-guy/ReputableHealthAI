Study Title: Effectiveness of moringa biscuit (Moringa oleifera) and snakehead fish (Channa striata) in improving the nutritional status of pregnant women with chronic energy deficiency.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of moringa biscuits and snakehead fish in improving the nutritional status of pregnant women with chronic energy deficiency (CED). The study was a randomized control trial carried out in two stages. The first stage was carried out in 2020, while the second stage was implemented in 2021 in Sigi Regency, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Thirty pregnant women with CED were divided into two groups. Five pieces of biscuits (60g) were given every day for three months to women in the intervention group while the control group were given biscuits without moringa and snakehead fish. The analysis consisted of paired t-test statistics. The results showed that giving biscuits significantly improved the nutritional status of pregnant women with CED, with the mean body mass index Centre (BMI) having a value of (P 0.000). In contrast, the upper arm circumference did not differ between the intervention and control groups. (P 0.247). We conclude that the consumption of moringa and snakehead fish biscuits provides a higher average contribution of energy and nutrients in pregnant women with CED.
