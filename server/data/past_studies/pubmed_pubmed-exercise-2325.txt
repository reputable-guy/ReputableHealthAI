Study Title: The ventilatory efficiency parameters outperform peak oxygen consumption in monitoring the therapy effects in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Study Summary:
We sought the cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) parameter that most accurately reflected therapeutic efficacy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Well-being questionnaire, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide measurements, echocardiography, and CPET were performed in patients with symptomatic non-obstructive HCM during phase II, randomized, open-label multicentre study, before and after 16&#xa0;weeks of traditional or sacubitril/valsartan treatment. Patients were followed 36&#xa0;months after the initial CPET. Primary endpoints were changes in: 1) peak oxygen consumption (VO); 2) VOat anaerobic threshold (AT); 3) oxygen pulse; 4) minute ventilation (VE)/carbon-dioxide (CO) production slope; 5) VE/VCOat AT (VE/VCO_AT); 6) VE/VCOnadir; 7) VE/VCOintercept; and 8) partial end-tidal pressure of carbon-dioxide (PCO) change during CPET. Of 115 screened patients, 61 (52&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;14&#xa0;years, 43&#xa0;% women) were included. Within subject therapy effects were detected only by the VE/VCOintercept and PCOchange, whereas the differences between medical regimens were detected by differences in VE/VCOnadir and VE/VCO_AT changes after the treatment. The best predictors of the change in well-being were left ventricular outflow tract maximal gradient and VE/VCOintercept (B&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.41,0.36; SE&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.16,0.30; CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.14-0.79, 0.15-1.14; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006,0.016, respectively). Adverse cardiac events were best predicted by the initial VE/VCOnadir. Ventilatory efficiency parameters outperform peak VOin gauging therapy effects in patients with HCM.
