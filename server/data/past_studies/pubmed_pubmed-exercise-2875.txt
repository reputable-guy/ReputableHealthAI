Study Title: High-intensity interval versus moderate-intensity continuous cycling training in Parkinson's disease: a randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Exercise training is recommended to improve the quality of life in those living with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the optimal prescription to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and disease-related motor symptoms remains unknown. Twenty-nine participants with PD were randomly allocated to either 10 wk of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (= 15; 6 female) or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) (= 14; 5 female). The primary outcome was the change in maximal oxygen consumption (V&#x307;o). Secondary outcomes included changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III motor score, Parkinson's Fatigue Scale (PFS)-16, resting and exercise cardiovascular measures, gait, balance, and knee extensor strength and fatigability. Exercise training increased V&#x307;o(main effect of time,< 0.01), with a clinically meaningful difference in the change following HIIT versus MICT (&#x394;3.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.7 vs. 1.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.2 mL&#xb7;kg&#xb7;min,= 0.099). The UPDRS motor score improved over time (< 0.001) but without any differences between HIIT versus MICT (&#x394;-9.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.3 vs. -8.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.4,= 0.51). Self-reported subjective fatigue (PFS-16) decreased over time (< 0.01) but was similar between HIIT and MICT groups (= 0.6). Gait, balance, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) were unchanged with training (all> 0.09). Knee extensor strength increased over time (= 0.03) but did not differ between HIIT versus MICT (&#x394;8.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.9 vs. 11.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.2 Nm,= 0.69). HIIT alone increased the muscular endurance of the knee extensors during an isotonic fatigue task to failure (= 0.04). In participants with PD, HIIT and MICT both increased V&#x307;oand led to improvements in motor symptoms and perceived fatigue; HIIT may offer the potential for larger changes in V&#x307;oand reduced knee extensor fatigability.The optimal exercise prescription to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and disease-related motor symptoms in adults with Parkinson's disease remains unknown. In a single-center randomized trial consisting of either 10 wk of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), we found that both training modes increased V&#x307;o, with a larger clinically meaningful difference following HIIT. Both exercise modes improved motor symptoms and subjective fatigue, whereas HIIT increased the muscular endurance of the knee extensors.
