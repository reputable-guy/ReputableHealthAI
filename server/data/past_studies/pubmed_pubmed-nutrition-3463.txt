Study Title: Five-Year Mortality Outcomes for Eating As Treatment (EAT), a Health Behavior Change Intervention to Improve Nutrition in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Stepped-Wedge, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition affects up to 80% of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and is associated with higher burden of disease, poorer treatment outcomes, and greater mortality. The Eating As Treatment (EAT) intervention is a behavioral intervention previously demonstrated to be effective in improving nutritional status, depression, and quality of life in patients with HNC. This article examines the effects of the EAT intervention on 5-year mortality among participants. A multicenter, stepped-wedge, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 5 Australian hospitals. Dietitians were trained to deliver EAT, a combination of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy strategies, to patients with HNC receiving radiation therapy. Secondary analyses of survival benefit on an intention-to-treat basis were performed. Differences in proportions of 5-year all-cause mortality between the control and EAT intervention arms were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, and 5-year survival rates were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Analyses controlled for temporal effects (study duration), hospital site (clustering), and baseline nutritional status differences. Overall, there were 64 deaths in the 5 years after enrollment, 36 (24%) among those assigned to the control condition and 28 (18%) among those assigned to EAT. Logistic regression showed statistically significant reduced odds in favor of EAT (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.11-0.96), with an absolute risk reduction of 17% (95% CI, 0.01-0.33) and a relative risk reduction of 55% (95% CI, 0.22-0.92), resulting in a number needed to treat of 6 (95% CI, 4-13). Survival analysis revealed that risk of death was significantly reduced by the EAT intervention (hazard ratio, 0.39; 0.16-0.96). Participation in EAT provided a statistically and clinically meaningful survival benefit, likely via improved nutrition during radiation therapy. This survival benefit strengthens the finding of the main trial, showing that a behavioral intervention focused on nutrition could improve HNC outcomes. Replication studies using stepped-wedge designs for implementation into clinical practice may be warranted.
