Study Title: Salivary cortisol is associated with cognitive changes in patients with fibromyalgia.

Study Summary:
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a stress-related chronic pain disorder with common cognitive complaints. This study characterized cognitive dysfunction in patients with FM and explored whether these changes are linked to altered cortisol levels. Consecutive 44 patients with FM and 48 healthy controls were enrolled for the assessments of subjective and objective cognitive functions and diurnal levels of salivary cortisol (sampled at awakening, 30&#xa0;min after awakening, 3&#xa0;pm, and bedtime). All measurements were compared between the groups and evaluated for clinical correlation. The FM group had more subjective cognitive complaints and performed poorer in objective cognitive testing in memory (delayed recall in Chinese Version Verbal Learning Test and Taylor Complex Figure Test), language (Boston Naming Test), and executive domains (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) after adjustments for education. The diurnal cortisol levels of patients with FM tended to be lower, especially at 30&#xa0;min after awakening and bedtime. Moreover, moderate positive correlations existed between the Chinese Version Verbal Learning Test, Boston Naming Test and the morning cortisol levels within the FM group. We suggested the altered cognitive function in FM may be linked to stress maladaptation. Future studies are warranted to elucidate whether stress management improves cognitive performance in patients with FM.
