Study Title: Comparison of the effects of training in the standing and lying positions on the quality of life and clinical symptoms in women with mild varicose veins: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Patients with varicose veins are prevented from prolonged standing. Considering that exercise can be implemented in different positions, the aim of the current study was to compare the effects of training at standing and lying positions on quality of life, and clinical symptoms in women with mild varicose veins. Twenty-five women with mild varicose veins aged 35-50 years were randomly assigned to three groups; exercise at standing position (n=10), exercise at lying position (n=8) and control (no treatment) group (n=7). Each exercise program involved 6 weeks of training. Quality of life, pain severity, ankle swelling, and lower leg and ankle circumferences were measured using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), four-point pitting edema grading scale, and tape measure, respectively at baseline and at the end of the study. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the least significant difference (LSD) as post hoc test. Following a 6-week exercise program, there was a significant improvement in the quality of life of the participants in both exercise groups, and a significant reduction in pain, ankle swelling, and lower leg and ankle circumferences compared to pre-training and control group (P <0.05). However, there was no significant difference between two exercise groups in terms of study variables (P >0.05). The current study showed that exercise program comprising standing position exercises can significantly reduce the symptoms of mild varicose veins.
