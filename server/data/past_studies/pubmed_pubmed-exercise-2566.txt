Study Title: Impact of a multimodal effort re-education programme on functionality, physical performance, and functional capacity in cancer patients with dyspnoea: a randomised experimental study.

Study Summary:
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the survival rates of cancer patients. However, this has also led to an increase in side effects, such as dyspnoea, which can negatively impact of patients. We propose a programme for re-educating effort. The main objective is to test the effectiveness of this programme in improving respiratory symptoms and functionality in cancer patients. Experimental, prospective, longitudinal, randomised study with a parallel fixed-assignment scheme (CG-IG). The patients were selected from the Medical Oncology Service of the University Hospital Complex of Salamanca (CAUSA), Spain. Two parallel intervention programmes were designed for the two study groups (Conventional Clinical Practice-Effort Re-education Programme). Primary variables: dyspnoea (MRC), functionality (Barthel); secondary variables: physical performance (SPPB) and functional capacity (ECOG) and the socio-demographic variables (age, sex, anatomopathological diagnosis, and number of treatment lines). The study sample consisted of 182 patients, with 12 excluded, resulting in a final sample size of n&#x2009;=&#x2009;170. Sex distribution (CG: 52.9% male and 47.1% female; IG: 49.4% male and 50.6% female). The primary oncological diagnosis was lung cancer, and the most frequent tumour stages were III and IV. Statistically significant differences were found between the IG and CG scores (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.887, 95% CI) and between the IG and CG scores (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.358, 95% CI), indicating that the IG performed better. The results of this study support the beneficial effects of an exercise re-education programme, carried out by an interdisciplinary team in improving the autonomy of oncology patients with dyspnoea. The clinical trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04186754). (03 September 2019).
