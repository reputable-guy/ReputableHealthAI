Study Title: Effects of Prebiotic Yeast Mannan on Gut Health and Sleep Quality in Healthy Adults: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Human gut health is closely related to sleep. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of yeast mannan (YM) in improving bowel habits and sleep quality, along with metabolomics in fecal samples. A total of 40 healthy adults (age range, 22-64 years) with discomfort in defecation were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive either YM (= 20; 1.1 g/day) or placebo (= 20) for four weeks. Participants recorded their defecation habits throughout the test periods. Sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using an EEG device and fecal sampling were performed pre- and post-treatment. The YM group significantly increased defecation frequency and stool volumes compared to the placebo group. After 4 weeks of treatment, the non-REM sleep stage 3 (N3) duration in the YM group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group. YM ingestion significantly lengthened total time in bed (TIB) and significantly shortened N3 latency compared to placebo intake during the trial. The metabolomics analysis found a total of 20 metabolite differences between the YM and placebo groups. As a result of stepwise linear regression, changes in fecal propionate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were identified as the primary factors explaining changes in TIB and N3 latency, respectively. Our findings suggest that the prebiotic YM could be beneficial to gut health and sleep quality.
