Study Title: Somatosensory and dynamic balance improvement in older adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy through sensorimotor exercise: A multisite randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To examine the effect of the Feldenkrais method on lower legs and foot somatosensory postural control-related function, dynamic balance, fear of falling and quality of life in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy in the short and mid-term. A single-blinded, parallel, multicentric randomized control trial was conducted in two health hospitals. Subjects with diabetic polyneuropathy and older than 55 years with a history of falls or dynamic balance dysfunction were recruited from the hospital databases and randomly allocated to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received 16 sessions of sensorimotor training based on the Feldenkrais method. Both groups received diabetic foot care instructions. The results were measured at the 3 and 6-month follow-up periods. The mean age was 70&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;8. A total of 44 participants were enrolled in the study, and 27 completed the process. No adverse events were reported. After the intervention, significant somatosensory results were obtained (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). The results of the Up and Go and POMA tests were significant after the intervention (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and during the 3-month follow-up period for POMA (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.018). The fear of falling showed significant results at the 3-month follow-up period (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03), and the quality of life in all measurements. Significant short-term effects were obtained on somatosensory postural control-related function, dynamic balance, and fear of falling. Significant short and mid-term effects were achieved on quality of life. Older adults with diabetic polyneuropathy, dynamic balance impairment, or a history of falls can improve their abilities through the Feldenkrais method. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05262946.
