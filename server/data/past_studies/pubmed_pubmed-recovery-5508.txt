Study Title: Patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve reduced postprandial glucose levels during insulin intensive therapy may have a better recovery of &#x3b2;-cell function.

Study Summary:
To explore parameters that may determine the improvement in C-peptide levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. The trial included a lead-in period for collecting baseline parameters and correcting hyperglycemia, a 4-day CGM period, and a 2-3&#xa0;weeks treatment period. After screening, patients were hospitalized and randomized to the metformin add-on NovoRapid group or the Prandilin group. Once the glycemic target was reached, all patients underwent a 4-day CGM, with treatments maintained for 2-3&#xa0;weeks. OGTTs were performed at baseline and endpoint. The primary endpoint was identifying factors contributing to better &#x3b2;-cell function recovery after CSII therapy. A total of 99 recruited patients were admitted as inpatients and achieved glycemic control within 3.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;days. Of these, 83 (84&#xa0;%) patients showed improvement in C-peptide levels, while 16 (16&#xa0;%) did not show any change in C-peptide levels at the endpoint. Pearson analysis showed a negative correlation between the incremental AUC of glucose concentration (from 0700 to 1000) and the increase in incremental AUC of C-peptide levels (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.199, P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). Drug-na&#xef;ve T2D patients with lower postprandial glucose concentration during CSII therapy exhibit better &#x3b2;-cell function recovery.
