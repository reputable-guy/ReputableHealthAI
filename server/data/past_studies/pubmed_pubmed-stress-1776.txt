Study Title: Effectiveness of Mobile-Based Progressive and Fixed Physical Activity on Depression, Stress, Anxiety, and Quality of Life Outcomes Among Adults in South Korea: Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Depression acts as a significant obstacle to the overall well-being of individuals. Given the significant consequences, timely recognition and proactive steps to manage symptoms of depression become essential. Such actions not only reduce personal distress but also play a crucial role in reducing its far-reaching impact on society as a whole. In response to this concern, the objective of this study was to explore the use of mobile-based interventions as a possible remedy. More specifically, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of 2 types of physical activity (PA), progressive and fixed, within a mobile-based app on depression, perceived stress, anxiety, physical health, and psychological health, aiming to contribute to the optimization of mental health benefits. Participants (N=60; mean age 25.29, SD 6.10 years) were recruited using a combination of web-based and offline methods, and the study lasted for 8 weeks. The baseline and posttest questionnaires were administered to all participants. The participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: progressive group (n=20; performing mobile-based progressive PA), fixed group (n=20; performing mobile-based fixed intensity PA), and control group C (n=20). Data analysis involved comparing scores between the experimental and control groups using a one-way ANOVA, paired sample t tests (2-tailed), and repeated measures ANOVA with a 3 (group)&#xd7;2 (time) design. The findings revealed significant improvements in mental health indicators among participants engaged in both fixed and progressive PA groups compared with the control group. However, the fixed PA group demonstrated more significant reductions in symptoms. Specifically, the progressive PA group showed significant reductions in depression (F=6.941; P=.01; &#x3b7;=0.16) and perceived stress (F=5.47; P=.03; &#x3b7;=0.13), while the fixed PA group exhibited significant reductions in depression (F=5.36; P=.03; &#x3b7;=0.12), perceived stress (F=7.81; P=.008; &#x3b7;=0.17), and general anxiety disorder (F=5.45; P=.03; &#x3b7;=0.13) compared with the control group. This study underscores the potential of mobile-based PA in improving mental health outcomes. The findings offer significant insights for mental health professionals and researchers aiming to optimize mental well-being through innovative mobile therapies.
