Study Title: Predictors of concerned others' mental health and quality of life over 12&#xa0;months following adults' entry into treatment for an alcohol use disorder.

Study Summary:
People in treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) can negatively impact their Concerned Others (COs). This longitudinal study examined patient and CO characteristics associated with CO outcomes. Participants were 279 dyads of patients entering residential treatment and their CO. Outcomes were COs' mental health and quality of life. The study collected patient and CO predictors and CO outcomes at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups as part of a randomized controlled trial. In the first set of models, the analytic approach identified baseline patient predictors associated with COs' outcomes measured at baseline and follow-ups. In the second set of models, we examined whether those effects remained after adding baseline CO characteristics. In the first set of models, COs of older age and whose patient reported less CO-patient relationship stress had better mental health. Also, married COs and those with higher income and whose patient reported no violence in the CO-patient relationship had better quality of life. In the second set of models, COs whose patient entered treatment due to criminal justice involvement, with more social support, less reported stigma, and less use of avoidance coping had better mental health. Also, married COs, those with higher income, and less reported discrimination stigma had better quality of life. Understanding patient and CO characteristics that are associated with COs' outcomes may inform AUD treatment programs' efforts to help COs. Identifying modifiable determinants of CO outcomes is important to clinical practice regardless of whether the patient chooses to obtain treatment.
