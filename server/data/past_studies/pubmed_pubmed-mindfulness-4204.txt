Study Title: Examination of eating competence in a geo-diverse sample with metabolic syndrome.

Study Summary:
Eating competence (EatC) is an intra-individual approach to eating attitudes and behaviors associated with greater well-being. EatC research has not included persons with confirmed metabolic syndrome (MetS). Therefore, EatC of persons with MetS was explored to identify unique associations and inform implementation of MetS lifestyle interventions using baseline data from a multisite, randomized trial of a 2-year lifestyle intervention with MetS. EatC, measured with the Satter Eating Competence Inventory 2.0 (ecSI 2.0&#x2122;), was examined for relationships with bioclinical measures (e.g., blood pressure, lipids), medication use, BMI, waist circumference, fruit/vegetable intake, and psychosocial factors, (e.g., stress, mindfulness). Data were collected in person and video call by trained research personnel. EatC was examined as a continuous score and as a categorical variable with ecSI 2.0&#x2122; scores &#x2265; 32 considered eating competent. Participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;618) were predominantly female (76%), White (74%), college educated (60%). Mean age was 55.5 &#xb1; 11&#xa0;y. Mean ecSI 2.0&#x2122; was 29.9 &#xb1; 7.4 and 42% were eating competent. EatC was greater for males, persons who were older and food secure. Competent eaters (vs. non-eating competent) had lower waist circumference (112.7 &#xb1; 12.5&#xa0;cm vs.116.8 &#xb1; 16.0&#xa0;cm; P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and BMI (35.0 &#xb1; 6.1 vs. 37.5 &#xb1; 7.3; P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Serum triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and blood pressure did not differ by EatC status. Compared to non-eating competent persons, competent eaters perceived less stress, were more mindful, indicated better physical function, and more habitual vegetable intake (all P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001) and sensory awareness (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). EatC in MetS paralleled the non-MetS profile. EatC was associated with a healthier psychosocial profile, waist circumference and BMI. Findings support further research to examine the mediational or moderating influence of EatC in the treatment of MetS.
