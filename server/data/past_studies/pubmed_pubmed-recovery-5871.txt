Study Title: Role of preoperative zinc, magnesium and budesonide gargles in Postoperative Sore Throat (POST) - a randomised control trial.

Study Summary:
Post-operative sore throat (POST) has an incidence ranging from 21 to 80%. To prevent the development of POST, several pharmacological measures have been tried. Aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of preoperative zinc, magnesium and budesonide gargles in reducing the incidence and severity of POST in patients who underwent endotracheal intubation for elective surgeries. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled equivalence trial in 180 patients admitted for elective surgical procedures under general anaesthesia. Patients were randomised into three groups; group Z received 40&#xa0;mg Zinc, group M received 250&#xa0;mg Magnesium Sulphate and group B received 200&#xa0;&#xb5;g Budesonide in the form of 30&#xa0;ml tasteless and colourless gargle solutions. Sore throat assessment and haemodynamic recording was done postoperatively at immediate recovery (0&#xa0;h) and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24&#xa0;h post-operatively. POST was graded on a four-point scale (0-3). POST score was comparable at all recorded time points i.e. 0,2,4,6,8,12 and 24&#xa0;h. Maximum incidence was seen at 8&#xa0;h in group B (33.3%) and the minimum incidence was at 24&#xa0;h in group Z (10%) (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). It was found that the incidence of POST was more in the surgeries lasting longer than 2&#xa0;h in all groups. This difference was found to be statistically significant in Groups M and B. The incidence of POST was found to be comparable between laparoscopic and open procedures. Magnesium, zinc and budesonide have an equivocal effect in the prevention of POST at different time points. The incidence of sore throat increases significantly in surgeries lasting more than two hours if magnesium or budesonide have been used as premedicant. Duration of surgery is an independent predictor for POST. CTRI/2021/05/033741 Date-24/05/2021(Clinical Trial Registry of India).
