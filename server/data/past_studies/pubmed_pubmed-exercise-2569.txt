Study Title: Karate Kata training: A promising intervention for behavioral problems in elementary school children.

Study Summary:
Behavioral issues frequently arise in primary school children, affecting their academic performance, social interactions, and general welfare. These concerns encompass challenges related to attention, concentration, aggression, oppositional behavior, and social maladaptation. The purpose of the current study was to examine the impacts of karate Kata training on extrinsic behavioral problems of elementary school students. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaire was given to all fourth- to sixth-grade students from a male elementary school, totaling 241 students, in Mashhad, Iran. A total of 76 eligible school-aged children with a total score of 65 and above in attention, aggression, oppositional defiance, and social maladaptation issues were selected and randomly assigned to an exercise group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38) or a no-exercise control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38). Participants in the exercise group were instructed to engage in Kata training, which consists of a series of choreographed movements designed to enhance physical and mental discipline, for a duration of 12 60-min sessions, whereas the participants in the control group followed their daily activities. The CBCL from the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment was used to assess dependent variables such as attention and concentration, aggression, oppositional defiance, and social maladaptation at baseline and post-intervention. The repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that Kata training results in significant improvements in attention and concentration and significant reductions in aggression, oppositional defiance, and social maladaptation among elementary school students (all ps&#xa0;<&#xa0;.001). These results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating Kata training into interventions aimed at improving the behavioral outcomes of children.
