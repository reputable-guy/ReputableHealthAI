Study Title: Phase 1 dose escalation study of the MDM2 inhibitor milademetan as monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine in patients with myeloid malignancies.

Study Summary:
Mouse double minute-2 homolog (MDM2) plays a key role in downregulating p53 activity in hematologic malignancies, and its overexpression is associated with poor outcomes. This phase 1 study assessed the safety and efficacy of different dosing regimens of the MDM2 inhibitor milademetan as monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine (AZA) in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Seventy-four patients (monotherapy, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;57; milademetan-AZA combination, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) were treated. The maximum tolerated dose of milademetan was 160&#x2009;mg once daily given for the first 14-21&#x2009;days of 28-day&#x2009;cycles as monotherapy and on Days 5-14 in combination with AZA. Dose-limiting toxicities were gastrointestinal, fatigue, or renal/electrolyte abnormalities. Treatment-emergent adverse events related to milademetan occurred in 82.5% and 64.7% of participants in the monotherapy and AZA combination arms, respectively. Two participants (4.2%) in the monotherapy arm achieved complete remission (CR), and 1 (2.1%) achieved CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). Two participants (13.3%) achieved CRi in the combination arm. New TP53 mutations, detected only during milademetan monotherapy, were found pre-existing below standard detection frequency by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Milademetan was relatively well tolerated in this population; however, despite signals of activity, clinical efficacy was minimal.
