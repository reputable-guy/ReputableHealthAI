Study Title: Efficacy of a Combination Treatment of Ablative Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy and Recombinant Human Epidermal Growth Factor for Atrophic Acne Scars.

Study Summary:
Atrophic acne scars (AAS) are disfiguring and permanent changes caused by inflammatory acne. Fractional carbon dioxide is a common ablative device used to treat this condition. However, issues such as unclear effectiveness, frequent treatments, and potential side effects exist. In recent years, recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) has also been frequently reported for its application in the treatment of acne scars. To explore the potential synergistic effect of fractional carbon dioxide laser combined with rhEGF in AAS treatment. We enrolled 15 patients with AAS. They received fractional carbon dioxide laser treatment and were then randomly assigned to receive either rhEGF or a placebo on one side of the face. The procedure was repeated three times, and the results were evaluated using the &#xe9;chelle d'&#xe9;valuation clinique des cicatrices d'acn&#xe9; (ECCA) score and analyzed using the CBS camera system, 3D analysis (3DMD). Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) examination was also conducted. Both sides exhibited significant improvement in the appearance of the acne scars after treatment, as confirmed by the ECCA score, 3DMD data, and CBS texture score. On the rhEGF-treated side, the pore number and epidermal pigment area significantly improved as compared to the control side, whereas no significant differences were observed in the other data. Under RCM, a significant increase in epidermal thickness and appearance of reticular collagen fibers in the dermal layer after treatment was observed. Compared to the sole use of laser, the combination of fractional carbon dioxide laser and rhEGF does not significantly enhance scar therapeutic effects. However, it does shorten the recovery period after laser treatment and improves the pore appearance.
