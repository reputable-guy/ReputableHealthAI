Study Title: Report on the 4th Board Meeting of the International Human Phenome Consortium.

Study Summary:
Phenome has become a consensus as the next innovation source of biomedicine. As the global network dedicated to large-scale research efforts on human phenome and promoting the Human Phenome Project, the Board of International Human Phenome Consortium (IHPC) plays an essential role to guide the strategy and implementation of international human phenome project and to ensure coordination across the IHPC members. The 4th International Human Phenome Consortium Board Meeting was held virtually on December 13, 2022. During the meeting, the keynote speeches highlighted the latest advancements in phenomics. The construction and discoveries of the first human phenome Atlas had shown promising potential in limb development, disease prevention, and early diagnosis. Combining genome-phenome sequencing, analysis, and wellness coaching enhanced individual wellness. Phenomics trajectories from healthy to diseased states and recovery provided insight into the metabolic risk spaces associated with COVID-19. Board members from Ghana, Malaysia, India, and Russia presented their own plans and research progress. The IHPC Board deliberated on the "Framework Guidelines for Human Phenome-related Measurements" and "Proposal of the PhenoBank Initiative". The meeting also featured a presentation of the annual report of the IHPC Journal. Laboratory coordination, interoperable databases, and standardized platforms were productively discussed, which would enable concerted research efforts of the Human Phenome Project.
