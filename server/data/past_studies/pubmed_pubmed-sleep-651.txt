Study Title: Effects of sleep deprivation on food-related Pavlovian-instrumental transfer: a randomized crossover experiment.

Study Summary:
Recent research suggests that insufficient sleep elevates the risk of obesity. Although the mechanisms underlying the relationship between insufficient sleep and obesity are not fully understood, preliminary evidence suggests that insufficient sleep may intensify habitual control of behavior, leading to greater cue-elicited food-seeking behavior that is insensitive to satiation. The present study tested this hypothesis using a within-individual, randomized, crossover experiment. Ninety-six adults underwent a one-night normal sleep duration (NSD) condition and a one-night total sleep deprivation (TSD) condition. They also completed the Pavlovian-instrumental transfer paradigm in which their instrumental responses for food in the presence and absence of conditioned cues were recorded. The sleep&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;cue&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;satiation interaction was significant, indicating that the enhancing effect of conditioned cues on food-seeking responses significantly differed across sleep&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;satiation conditions. However, this effect was observed in NSD but not TSD, and it disappeared after satiation. This finding contradicted the hypothesis but aligned with previous literature on the effect of sleep disruption on appetitive conditioning in animals-sleep disruption following learning impaired the expression of appetitive behavior. The present finding is the first evidence for the role of sleep in Pavlovian-instrumental transfer effects. Future research is needed to further disentangle how sleep influences motivational mechanisms underlying eating.
