Study Title: Integrative Effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Acustimulation and Autonomic-Endocrine Mechanisms on Postprocedural Recovery in Patients With Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the integrative effects and mechanisms of transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) on postprocedural recovery from endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). A total of 86 patients for elective ERCP were randomly ordered to receive TEA (n&#xa0;= 43) at acupoints PC6 and ST36 or Sham-TEA (n&#xa0;= 43) at sham points from 24 hours before ERCP (pre-ERCP) to 24 hours after ERCP (PE24). Scores of gastrointestinal (GI) motility-related symptoms and abdominal pain, gastric slow waves, and autonomic functions were recorded through the spectral analysis of heart rate variability; meanwhile, circulatory levels of inflammation cytokines of tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) and interleukin (IL)-10 and GI hormones of motilin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1) TEA, but not Sham-TEA, decreased the post-ERCP GI motility-related symptom score (2.4&#xa0;&#xb1; 2.6 vs 7.9&#xa0;&#xb1; 4.6, p&#xa0;< 0.001) and abdominal pain score (0.5&#xa0;&#xb1; 0.7 vs 4.1&#xa0;&#xb1; 2.7, p&#xa0;< 0.001) at PE24, and decreased the post-ERCP hospital day by 20.0% (p &#xff1c;0.05 vs Sham-TEA); 2) TEA improved the average gastric percentage of normal slow waves and dominant frequency by 34.6% and 33.3% at PE24, respectively (both p&#xa0;< 0.001 vs Sham-TEA); 3) TEA, but not Sham-TEA, reversed the ERCP-induced increase of TNF-&#x3b1; but not IL-10 at PE24, reflected as a significantly lower level of TNF-&#x3b1; in the TEA group than in the Sham-TEA group (1.6&#xa0;&#xb1; 0.5 pg/mL vs 2.1&#xa0;&#xb1; 0.9 pg/mL, p &#xff1c; 0.01); 4) compared with Sham-TEA, TEA increased vagal activity by 37.5% (p &#xff1c; 0.001); and 5) TEA caused a significantly higher plasma level of ghrelin (1.5&#xa0;&#xb1; 0.8 ng/ml vs 1.1&#xa0;&#xb1; 0.7 ng/ml, p &#xff1c; 0.05) but not motilin, VIP, or CCK than did Sham-TEA at PE24. TEA at PC6 and ST36 accelerates the post-ERCP recovery, reflected as the improvement in GI motility and amelioration of abdominal pain, and suppression of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x3b1; may mediate through both autonomic and ghrelin-related mechanisms.
