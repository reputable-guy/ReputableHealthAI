Study Title: Effectiveness of an ERAS-based exercise-nutrition management model in enhancing postoperative recovery for thoracoscopic radical resection of lung cancer: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To analyze the effect of an exercise-nutrition management model based on the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) concept on patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical surgery for lung cancer. From June 2019 to December 2022, 85 lung cancer patients who underwent thoracoscopic radical lung cancer surgery were randomly divided into 2 groups. The control group, consisting of 42 patients, received routine nursing care during the perioperative period. The study group, comprising 43 patients, implemented an exercise-nutrition management model based on the ERAS concept during the perioperative period. We compared general data, perioperative indicators, compliance, and complications between the 2 groups. Additionally, we assessed the nutritional status using the patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), and hemoglobin (Hb), as well as lung function, including forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), in the patient population following the Piper intervention. In the study group, the times to first defecation and getting out of bed, the duration of thoracic drainage tube indwelling, and the length of hospital stay were shorter than those in the control group. The VAS scores on the 2nd and 3rd postoperative days were lower in the study group than in the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Medication compliance was higher in the study group compared to the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Post-intervention, the PG-SGA scores in the study group were lower, while PA, ALB, and Hb levels were higher than those in the control group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). The MVV, FEV1, and FVC values were higher in the study group than in the control group after the intervention (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). The PFS and mMRC scores were lower in the study group compared to the control group after the intervention, and the QLQ-C30 scores were higher (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). The incidence of complications was 6.98% in the study group, which was not significantly different from 11.90% in the control group (P&#x2005;>&#x2005;.05). The exercise-nutrition management model, based on the ERAS concept, exhibits significant perioperative effects in patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical resection of lung cancer, improving their nutritional status and reducing complications.
