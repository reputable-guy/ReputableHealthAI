Study Title: Impacts of a Multi-Professional Family versus Isolated Intervention on Food Level Processing in Overweight Adolescents: A Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
The food consumption of adolescents has changed nowadays, with an increase in ultra-processed food that in general shows higher calories and lower nutrients. Because of this, the objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of a 12-week multi-professional family versus isolated intervention on the food level processing of overweight adolescents. A randomized clinical trial study was carried out in which adolescents (43; mean aged 13.73 years) who were divided into FG-family group (21; the adolescents performed the activities with their parents) and IG-isolated group (22; the adolescents performed the activities alone). The parameters measured before and after 12 weeks of multi-professional intervention (physical exercise, nutrition and psychoeducation) were: body mass, height and body mass index-BMI. The level of food processing was analyzed using a three-day food recall (24hR), classified according to the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population (fresh, minimally, processed and ultra-processed foods). The main results show that there was only a significant reduction in the consumption of processed foods (FG: 7.93%; IG: 49.73%) and ultra-processed foods (FG: 35.06%; IG: 67.16%) in grams (FG: 22.29%; IG: 65.23%) and calories (0.05; for all comparisons). The consumption of fresh foods in grams (FG:61.97%; IG: 147.13%) and calories (FG: 147.13%; IG: 118.03%) and minimally processed foods (FG: 27.45%; IG: 14.64%) in grams increased significantly (0.05; for all comparisons). However, no significant differences were observed between all variables analyzed for the groups, nor any interaction (0.05). In conclusion, both groups who participated in the activities showed positive changes with increased consumption of fresh foods and reduced consumption of processed foods, without difference between them.
