Study Title: Randomized double-masked controlled trial of cognitive training in breast cancer survivors: a preliminary study.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the acceptability, satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of cognitive training for improving cognitive function and health outcomes in breast cancer survivors (BCS). BCS enrolled in this 2-group randomized, double-masked controlled trial of cognitive training. Primary outcomes included the acceptability and satisfaction of the interventions. Secondary outcomes included examining the effect size and reliable improvement of perceived cognitive function and health outcomes, including work ability, health perception (status and change), and quality of life. Exploratory outcomes were performance on neuropsychological tests and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Data were collected at baseline and immediately post-intervention. Using ANCOVA models, the intervention was compared to attention control while adjusting for covariates and baseline values. The effect sizes for differences in means and the reliable improvement percentage were reported. Thirty-six BCS completed the study and were on average 57.6 (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.0) years old, 59.4% Caucasian, and had some college education (74.5%). Both programs were reported to be satisfactory and acceptable. Non-significant small effect sizes were noted for the intervention on cognitive abilities (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.26) and cognitive concerns (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.32), with reliable improvement noted in 32% and 28% of BCS, respectively. Small to medium effect sizes were noted in improvement in work ability (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.37) and health perception status (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.30) and change (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.60, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Cognitive training was acceptable to BCS and resulted in improvement in perceived cognitive function and perceptions of "real-world" health benefits. A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted to determine its effectiveness for objective cognitive performance.
