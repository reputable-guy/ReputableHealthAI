Study Title: Mindful self-compassion for psychological distress associated with skin conditions: An online intervention study.

Study Summary:
Background Chronic skin conditions are different from internal illnesses since they are often immediately visible to others. Patients feel self-conscious and often go through depression, anxiety, fear of stigma and a substantial psychological, social and economic impact. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to gather information about various strategies and psychosocial interventions that can be used to manage psychological distress associated with skin conditions and avoid it from being neglected amidst other health conditions. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) can be used for this. It is a resource-building mindfulness-based self-compassion training programme that uses a combination of personal development training and psychotherapy designed to enhance one's capacity for self-compassion by cultivating spacious awareness as a basis for compassionate action. Aims This study examined the impact of mindful self-compassion on depression, anxiety, stress, dermatology-specific quality of life, self-esteem and well-being in a sample of 88 adults aged 18-55 years suffering from chronic skin conditions. Methods This study used an experimental waitlist control design. Participants were recruited from two skin clinics using purposive sampling in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Pre-test data was collected through self-reported questionnaires on psychological distress, dermatology-specific quality of life, self-esteem and well-being. Participants who were experiencing psychological distress were randomly assigned to either the experimental or waitlist control group. The intervention named 'mindful self-compassion' was delivered through an online platform, twice a week, over a period of 4 weeks. Post-test data was collected later on all variables. Results ANCOVA was utilised where pre-test scores were used as covariates. Differences in pre-test and post-test scores between the intervention group and waitlist control group for depression, anxiety, stress, dermatology-specific quality of life, self-esteem and well-being were analysed. Participants in the intervention group were found to have lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress as compared to the waitlist control group and also had enhanced levels of self-esteem, well-being and dermatological quality of life. These differences were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Limitations The sample reflected heterogenous skin conditions, not a specific skin condition. The study was quantitative in nature, and we could not use any qualitative methods to assess the subjective experience of participants. Due to time constraints, follow-up data could not be gathered from participants to assess long-term effects on participants. Conclusion Mindful self-compassion can be effectively used to manage psychological distress in skin conditions. Dermatologists can become acquainted with basic signs of mental distress and the importance of psychological interventions. By collaborating with mental health professionals, patients can be given holistic treatment.
