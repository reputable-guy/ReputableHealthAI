Study Title: Tele-Mindfulness for Dementia's Family Caregivers: A Randomized Trial with a Usual Care Control Group.

Study Summary:
Caring for a family member with dementia is stressful and challenging. Family caregivers, as a vulnerable marginalized population and invisible backbone of the health care system, need accessible and effective interventions that are tailored to their particular needs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a live online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (tele-MBCT) intervention for family caregivers of individuals with dementia. Family caregivers were assigned to a tele-MBCT intervention or a usual care control group. Tele-MBCT participants attended eight weekly live online training and practiced mindfulness practices at home. All participants completed surveys at baseline, post-intervention, and 4-week follow-up. 26 participants (age 60&#xb1;13 years) were enrolled and randomized (14 in the intervention and 12 in the control group), and 92.3% completed the study. 88% of the participants were female, and 70% were caring for a parent for a mean of 5.12&#xb1;2.88 years. 84% of the participants in the intervention group attended at least seven sessions and the average of daily practice was 23.58&#xb1;45.71 minutes. All participants were satisfied with the intervention, and 88.8% were satisfied with the online delivery method. Participants in the intervention group showed Pre-Post improvement in self-compassion (t (11) = -2.49, p=0.03) and coping strategies (t (11) = 3.62, p=0.004) compared to the control group. Tele-MBCT is a feasible intervention and may improve psychological outcomes and adaptive coping in family caregivers of individuals with dementia. A larger controlled trial is warranted.
