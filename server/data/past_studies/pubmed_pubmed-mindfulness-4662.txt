Study Title: Brief adjunctive mindfulness-based cognitive therapy via Telehealth for anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Study Summary:
While cognitive-behavioral therapy is a highly efficacious treatment for anxiety, additional research is needed to identify adjunctive interventions that may augment treatment outcome. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an open feasibility trial of brief (i.e., four 75- to 90-minute sessions) mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for anxiety via telehealth for patients (&#x2009;=&#x2009;23) receiving individual CBT at an outpatient specialty clinic. Self-report measures of home practice compliance (weekly), intervention acceptability (post-intervention), mindfulness and self-compassion, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and transdiagnostic processes (pre- and post-intervention) were administered as part of routine clinical practice. Results indicated good retention and attendance rates, few technical difficulties, good home practice compliance, and high levels of perceived importance. Participants indicated that they would highly recommend the group to others and also recommended extending the group beyond four sessions. There were significant improvements in mindfulness and self-compassion and reductions in intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety sensitivity, distress intolerance, emotion dysregulation, and anxiety symptoms from pre- to post-intervention. Brief MBCT as an adjunctive treatment for anxiety via telehealth is feasible and acceptable, and shows promise in terms of engaging treatment targets and transdiagnostic processes and reducing anxiety symptoms.
