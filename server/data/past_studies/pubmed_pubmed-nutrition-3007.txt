Study Title: Effectiveness of a Nutrition Counseling Intervention on Food Consumption, According to the Degree of Processing: A Community-Based Non-Randomized Trial of Quilombola Communities in South Brazil.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition counseling intervention on food consumption according to the Nova classification that reflects levels of food processing. Controlled community trial was conducted in quilombola communities in the South of Brazil. Four communities were allocated to the control group (CG) and the intervention group (IG), two communities comprised each group. A total of 158 individuals (CG = 87; IG = 68) were included in the study. The intervention consisted of six theoretical and practical workshops on food and nutrition education, conducted over a 4-month period. We used a 24-hour recall at baseline and another post-intervention. There was an increase in the consumption of traditional quilombola food as an effect of the intervention (from 14.5% to 20.7% in the IG, and from 12.7% to 16.0% in the CG,= 0.05). There was no significant variation in the other Nova food groups according to time and intervention. An increase in traditional quilombola food indicates a resumption of traditional food intake and appreciation of local culture as an effect of this intervention at the community level.www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT02489149.
