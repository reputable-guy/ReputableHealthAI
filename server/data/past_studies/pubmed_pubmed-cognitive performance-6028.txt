Study Title: Extensive Familiarization Is Required Before Assessing Acute Changes in Multiple Object Tracking Performance.

Study Summary:
The Neurotracker CORE assessment is an 8-minute multiple object tracking (MOT) program used in sport science research and clinical rehabilitation as a perceptual-cognitive training tool; however, it has garnered interest for its potential use as an acute assessment of cognitive performance. Although some data exist regarding the learning effect of repeated exposures, it is often overlooked with investigators focusing primarily on the presence of transfer effects to other cognitive realms. As a result, exclusive data on the effect of repeated testing, or subsequent periods of no testing (ie,&#xa0;detraining) on test-retest reliability, and on MOT performance are sparse. Repeated-measures/reliability. Twenty-three recreationally active men and women completed 15 training sessions consisting of 2 CORE assessments per session (30 assessments). Participants were randomized to either 1 or 2&#xa0;weeks of detraining prior to completing 15 retraining sessions (30 assessments). Training and retraining periods were divided into 10 blocks (3 assessments/block) for analysis. MOT speed threshold (MOT-ST), consistency, fastest trial score success speed, lowest trial score miss speed, the number of perfect, near misses, and significant miss trials within each block were used to determine performance. Intraclass correlation coefficient, standard error of measurement, and minimal detectable change were used to determine reliability. Significant improvements in MOT-ST and fastest trial score success speed were noted within training blocks 1 to 6 and 1 to 7, respectively (P < .05). MOT-ST and fastest trial score success speed demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability between blocks 8 and 9. There was no effect of detraining period on performance during retraining. Eighteen tests are necessary to overcome training effects and establish a reliable baseline when MOT-ST is used as the performance outcome. Detraining periods up to 2&#xa0;weeks did not impact performance. The average of 3 discrete tests should be used when assessing MOT-ST performance.
