Study Title: Hybrid Delivery of Mindfulness Meditation and Perceived Stress in Pediatric Resident Physicians: A Randomized Clinical Trial of In-Person and Digital Mindfulness Meditation.

Study Summary:
Physicians are experiencing epidemic levels of work-related stress and burnout. Determine efficacy of mindfulness meditation delivered as a hybrid (in-person and digital) format to reduce perceived stress in pediatric residents. Pediatric residents (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;66) were block randomized to a hybrid Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) intervention, comprised of one in-person 60-min session and 6-week access to a digitally delivered MAPs curriculum (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;27) or wait-list control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;39). Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was administered at baseline and post-intervention as the primary outcome measure. A priori secondary outcomes were measured using the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory-9, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. After the first session, 58% participated at least one digital session (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.0; SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.3). MAPs participants showed significant decrease in PSS compared to controls, with between-group mean difference of 2.20 (95% CI 0.47-3.93) at post-intervention (effect size 0.91; 0.19-1.62). No secondary outcome group differences were detected. Exposure to a hybrid mindfulness intervention was associated with improvement in perceived stress among pediatric residents.Trial Registration: NCT03613441.
