Study Title: Efficacy of Standardized Process Management of Early Postoperative Enteral Nutrition After Laparoscopic Hepatectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
We sought to investigate the efficacy of standardized process management of early postoperative enteral nutrition in patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy. From January 2022 to January 2023, a total of 98 patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy in our hospital were enrolled in this prospective study. The participants were allocated into the study group (49 cases, given standardized process management of early postoperative enteral nutrition) and the control group (49 cases, given conventional early postoperative enteral nutrition) based on a random number table. Observation indicators included postoperative recovery, nutritional status, quality of life, and complications. The time of first anal exhaust, eating, off-bed, first defecation, and postoperative hospital stay in the 2 groups was significantly shorter than those in the control group ( P <0.05). After the intervention, the levels of transferrin, prealbumin, and albumin in the study group were evidently higher than those in the control group ( P <0.05). The scores of overall health, body pain, body function, physiological function, vitality, social function, emotional function, and mental health in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group after intervention ( P <0.05). The standardized process management of early postoperative enteral nutrition showed promising results in effectively improving the nutritional status, rehabilitation, and quality of life, as well as reducing the incidence of related complications among patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy, which supports a wide application in clinical practice.
