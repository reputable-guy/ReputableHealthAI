Study Title: Neurobehavioral functions during recurrent periods of sleep restriction: effects of intra-individual variability in sleep duration.

Study Summary:
To investigate whether neurobehavioral impairments are exacerbated during successive cycles of sleep restriction and recovery in young adults, and whether a variable short sleep schedule can mitigate these impairments relative to a stable one. Fifty-two healthy young adults (25 males, aged: 21-28) were randomly assigned to the stable short sleep group, the variable short sleep group, or the control group in this laboratory-based study. They underwent two baseline nights of 8-hour time-in-bed (TIB), followed by two cycles of "weekday" sleep opportunity manipulation and "weekend" recovery (8-hour TIB). During each manipulation period, the stable short sleep and the control groups received 6- and 8-hour TIBs each night respectively, while the variable short sleep group received 8-hour, 4-hour, 8-hour, 4-hour, and 6-hour TIBs from the first to the fifth night. Neurobehavioral functions were assessed five times each day. The stable short sleep group showed faster vigilance deterioration in the second week of sleep restriction as compared to the first. This effect was not observed in the variable short sleep group. Subjective alertness and practice-based improvement in processing speed were attenuated in both short sleep groups. In young adults, more variable short sleep schedules incorporating days of prophylactic or recovery sleep might mitigate compounding vigilance deficits resulting from recurrent cycles of sleep restriction. However, processing speed and subjective sleepiness were still impaired in both short sleep schedules. Getting sufficient sleep consistently is the only way to ensure optimal neurobehavioral functioning.
