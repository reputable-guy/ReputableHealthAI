Study Title: Initial Study on the Impact of Probiotics on Postoperative Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gut Microbiota after Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Placebo-Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become the predominant bariatric surgery, leading to significant weight loss and reductions in obesity-related complications. However, postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation and bloating are common. This study aims to evaluate the impact of probiotic supplementation on postoperative gastrointestinal symptoms in patients undergoing SG. The secondary aim is to analyze laboratory and stool test results. This prospective, placebo-controlled study included patients undergoing SG at a single center. Participants were adults without specific gastrointestinal diseases. They were randomly assigned to either the Probiotics or Controls group. Gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory and stool tests were assessed before surgery and one month after. Thirty-one patients participated, with 15 in the Probiotics group and 16 in the Controls group. Probiotic supplementation significantly increased the number of stools per week (= 0.027) and reduced constipation incidence (= 0.002). Patients in the Probiotics group reported easier defecation and greater bowel movement completeness (= 0.015,= 0.004). No significant differences in weight loss or laboratory tests were observed between the groups. Stool microbiota analysis showed a return to normal levels of,, andin the Probiotics group and an increase in the Controls group. Probiotic supplementation after SG significantly reduces constipation without adverse effects. These findings suggest that incorporating probiotics into postoperative care protocols can enhance patient comfort and recovery.
