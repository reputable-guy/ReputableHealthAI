Study Title: Treatment adherence and wellness, nutrition, and physical&#xa0;activity outcomes of diabetic patients with comorbid&#xa0;depression during the 18-month follow-up of the TELE-DD study.

Study Summary:
A good adherence to pharmacological treatment in chronic pathologies such as type 2 diabetes and clinical depression is essential to improve illness prognosis. The main goal of the TELE-DD study was to analyze the effectiveness of a telephone, psychoeducational, and individualized intervention carried out by nurses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and comorbid clinical depression with prior nonadherence to pharmacological treatment. In this paper, we describe and analyze secondary outcomes of the trial intervention. A prospective cohort study was used to assess the effectiveness of a telephonic intervention (IG) in n&#x2009;=&#x2009;191 participants with a similar control group (CG). Adherence to pharmacological treatment was assessed using the patient's self-perceived adherence questionnaire. In addition to clinical (HbAc1, HDL, LDL), physical (body mass index, blood pressure) and psychological measures (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 affective state), and psychosocial distress due to Diabetes Distress Scale Questionnaire at 3, 6, 12, and 18&#x2009;months of follow-up were also analyzed. The proportion of "Total Adherents" in the IG was higher throughout the study. This was particularly true at month 18 of the intervention. Self-perceived adherence rates increased by 27.1% in the IG and by 1.1% in the CG. Results of clinical and physical measures were higher in the IG than in the CG at month 18 of the intervention. The interview based on positive reinforcement as well as individualized attention and flexibility in making telephone calls and dissemination of the intervention in the media closest to the patients were key to achieving good participation and collaboration as well as continuity in adherence to treatment and self-care.
