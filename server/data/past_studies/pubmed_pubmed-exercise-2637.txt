Study Title: Immediate effects of upper limb exercises with and without deep breathing on lung function after cardiac surgery - a randomized crossover trial.

Study Summary:
Open heart surgery, involving median sternotomy, may cause diminished chest wall motion and restrictive pulmonary function in the early postoperative period. Thoracic and upper extremity range of motion (ROM) exercises are often recommended after surgery but have not been evaluated regarding effect on lung volumes and oxygenation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immediate effect of upper limb elevations, with or without simultaneous deep breathing, on lung function after cardiac surgery. In a randomized 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;2 crossover trial, 22 adult patients (>&#x2009;18 years old) were assessed during one of the first days after surgery in the spring of 2022 at &#xd6;rebro University Hospital, Sweden. Exercises involving five bilateral upper limb elevations, performed either with simultaneous deep breathing (ROM-DB) or without (ROM), while sitting in an upright position at the edge of the bed, were evaluated. Peripheral oxygen saturation (Rad-5v; Masimo, Irvine, USA) was the primary outcome. Tidal volume and respiratory rate were recorded continuously during the exercises (Spiropalm; Cosmed, Rome, Italy). Heart rate, pain, exertion and dyspnoea were evaluated before and after the exercises. Both ROM-DB and ROM momentarily increased peripheral oxygen saturation (+&#x2009;1% &#xb1; 1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004 and +&#x2009;1% &#xb1; 1, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, respectively), with no significant differences between these exercises (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.525). ROM-DB significantly increased the Vcompared with ROM (798&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;316 vs. 602 mL&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;176, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). However, ROM-DB induced more pronounced pain (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012), exertion (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035) and dyspnoea (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) than ROM. Upper limb elevations improved oxygenation momentarily, both performed with and without simultaneous deep breathing, with no significant differences between these exercises. The additive deep breathing improved tidal volume compared with upper limb elevations alone, but induced more pain, exertion and dyspnoea during the performance of exercise.
