Study Title: Protein Supplementation Increases Adaptations to Low-Volume, Intra-Session Concurrent Training in Untrained Healthy Adults: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
Combined endurance and resistance training, also known as "concurrent training", is a common practice in exercise routines. While concurrent training offers the benefit of targeting both cardiovascular and muscular fitness, it imposes greater physiological demands on the body compared to performing each modality in isolation. Increased protein consumption has been suggested to support adaptations to concurrent training. However, the impact of protein supplementation on responses to low-volume concurrent training is still unclear. Forty-four untrained, healthy individuals (27 &#xb1; 6 years) performed two sessions/week of low-volume high-intensity interval training on cycle ergometers followed by five machine-based resistance training exercises for 8 weeks. Volunteers randomly received (double-blinded) 40 g of whey-based protein (PRO group) or an isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin, PLA group) after each session. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO) and overall fitness scores (computed from volunteers' VOand one-repetition maximum scores, 1-RM) significantly increased in both groups. The PRO group showed significantly improved 1-RM in all major muscle groups, while the PLA group only improved 1-RM in chest and upper back muscles. Improvements in 1-RM in leg muscles were significantly greater in the PRO group versus the PLA group. In conclusion, our results indicate that adaptations to low-volume concurrent training, particularly leg muscle strength, can be improved with targeted post-exercise protein supplementation in untrained healthy individuals.
