Study Title: Leveraging Trauma Informed Care for Digital Health Intervention Development in Opioid Use Disorder.

Study Summary:
Digital health refers to the use of information and communication technologies in medicine (including smartphone apps, wearables, other non-invasive sensors, informatics and telehealth platforms) to prevent illness, deliver treatment, and promote wellness. This rapidly proliferating group of technologies has the potential to reduce harm for people with opioid use disorder (OUD) and facilitate the recovery process; however, development in this space for OUD has been slower compared to that for other medical conditions. Unique issues with OUD management surrounding patient provider relationships, interaction with the healthcare system, autonomy and trust sometimes hinder care approaches, including those in digital health. The trauma informed care framework (TIC), developed for use by organizations to support individuals who have experienced trauma, has particular applicability for digital health interventions in OUD care. This manuscript will serve as a review of TIC principles and how they can be applied to digital health interventions to increase access, equity, and empowerment for people with OUD. We will highlight representative current and pipeline digital technologies for OUD, challenges with these technologies, TIC models for OUD, and the integration of TIC principles into digital technology development to better serve people with OUD. Finally, we will posit strategies to incorporate the aforementioned principles into future research efforts. We ultimately aim to use TIC as a lens through which to develop digital technologies to help individuals with OUD while minimizing harm.
