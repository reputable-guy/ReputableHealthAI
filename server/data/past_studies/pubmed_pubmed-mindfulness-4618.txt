Study Title: Predicting Perceived Problems in Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Recalls: A Quantitative Think-Aloud Study Comparing Automated Self-Assisted 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24) and INTAKE24&#xa9; in University Students.

Study Summary:
Demographic and psychosocial factors concerning dietary assessment error have been explored, but few studies have investigated the perceived problems experienced when completing dietary recalls. The aim of this research was to (i) compare the perceived problems encountered in two commonly used self-administered 24-hour dietary recall (24HR) programs (INTAKE24&#xa9; and ASA24&#xae;) and (ii) explore whether mindful and habitual eating are associated with perceived problems during dietary recall. A randomised quantitative crossover design and think-aloud methodology were employed. Undergraduate university students (N = 55, Mage = 25.5, SD = 8.2, 75% female) completed a food habits and mindfulness questions pre-program, one 24HR (whilst thinking aloud), and a systems usability scale post-program. A week later, they completed the other 24HR (whilst thinking aloud). During a pilot, a coding frame of perceived problems was devised to quantify participants&#x2019; perceived problems. INTAKE24&#xa9; generated significantly fewer perceived problems across all categories compared to ASA24&#xae; (17.2 vs. 33.1, p < 0.001). Of the participants, 68% reported a preference for INTAKE24&#xa9; over ASA24&#xae;. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that habits and systems usability were significant predictors of perceived problems for INTAKE24&#xa9; only. No significant predictors were found for ASA24&#xae;. The results provide insight into perceived problems people may encounter when using 24HR tools.
