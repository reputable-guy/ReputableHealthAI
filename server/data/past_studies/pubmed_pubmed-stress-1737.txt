Study Title: Receiving self-compassion in the virtual world: Testing the potential value of biofeedback.

Study Summary:
Self-compassion training has been shown to deliver mental health benefits and preliminary evidence suggests it might also be possible to deliver these benefits effectively via virtual reality (VR) technology. However, which features of the VR training environment influence these training benefits remains poorly understood. This study was designed to provide the first empirical test of the potential value of visual biofeedback during self-compassion training. It was theorised that the provision of biofeedback may increase the benefits of training by increasing mindfulness, a core component of self-compassion. Sixty participants were randomly allocated to one of two experimental conditions, both of which comprised VR-based self-compassion training, but only one of which included visual biofeedback (a red pulsating light representing heart rate). Relative to scores at baseline, participants reported greater self-compassion, and lower self-criticism, anxiety, and stress after VR self-compassion training. However, the provision of biofeedback did not influence the strength of these training effects. These data provide further evidence that VR administered self-compassion training may deliver potentially important mental health benefits, but also meaningfully extends this literature by proving the first evidence that visual biofeedback does not influence the strength of these benefits.
