Study Title: Effects of hospital-to-home transitional care on health outcomes of elderly patients in Islamic Republic of Iran.

Study Summary:
Hospitalization has a negative effect on the functional and clinical outcomes of elderly patients. To evaluate the effect of a care transition intervention on functional and clinical outcomes and quality-of-life of elderly patients in the Islamic Republic of Iran after hospital discharge during a 3-month follow-up. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 304 elderly hospitalized patients in Tehran from December 2018 to January 2020. The intervention group (n = 152) received care transition intervention and the control group (n = 152) received routine hospital discharge. All patients were assessed during hospital stay and at 30, 60 and 90 days after hospital discharge. Participants were evaluated using the Minimum Data Set-Home Care form, which assesses daily living activity, instrumental daily living activity, cognitive performance, cognition, pain, and depression. Rehospitalization and qualityof- life were evaluated, and differences between the groups and trends in quality-of-life were assessed. Only instrumental daily living activity in the functional outcomes and quality-of-life were greater in the intervention group than the controls. The intervention (odds ratio (OR): 0.11; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.01-0.97), age (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.01-1.33), and cognition (OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.02-1.51) predicted instrumental daily living activity. Age (coefficient: -0.009, P = 0.001), depression (coefficient: -0.157; P < 0.001), cognition (coefficient: -0.023, P < 0.001) and pain (coefficient: -0.106, P = 0.007) predicted quality-of-life. Care transition interventions can help maintain the independence of older adults after hospital discharge and improve their quality-of-life.
