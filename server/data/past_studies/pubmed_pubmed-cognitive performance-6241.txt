Study Title: Contrasting expectancy effects with objective measures in adults with untreated ADHD during QbTest.

Study Summary:
Expectancy has been associated with neuropsychological assessments and cognitive performance. However, little is known about the effects of expectations in clinical assessments during drug trials with continuous performance tests (CPTs). In a randomized, double-blind study with cross-over design, we examined if the participants' self-reported expectations changed after one-single dose immediate release methylphenidate (MPH) and after one-single dose placebo during the QbTest. Forty adults between 19 and 64&#x2009;years (72.5% women) with un treated ADHD were consecutively enrolled in the study and their assessments of expected performance, mental effort, perceived performance and help from the pill were analyzed. The study comprised two trial days with four days in between. The QbTest was performed twice on the same day, before and 80 minutes after a pill. Our study demonstrates that there were expectancy effects during CPTs. Participants reported lower mental effort and improved their performance in the coronary parameter QbInattention both after MPH and after placebo. No significant differences in expected performance were reported. The participants seemed to show some uncertainty when assessing their expected performance, however, they could evaluate their performance afterwards. In clinical practice, the focus should be on reinforcing patients' expectations in order to increase treatment effects.
