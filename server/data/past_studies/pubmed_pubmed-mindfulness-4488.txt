Study Title: The Effect of Internet-delivered Mindfulness Stress Reduction Combined with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy on Health Anxiety and Quality of Life of Caregiver of Patients Infected by COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a widespread disease all over the world that has caused many psychological complications such as health anxiety (HA) and low quality of life (QOL). Mindfulness-based approaches could improve these complications. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of Internet-delivered mindfulness stress reduction combined with acceptance and commitment therapy (IMSR-ACT) on QOL and HA of caregivers of patients infected by COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial, 72 people from Golpayegan city, Iran, who had a patient with COVID-19 in their family were selected from March to June 2020. A caregiver with a score above 27 on the Health Anxiety inventory (HAI-18) was selected using simple random sampling. Participants were assigned in the intervention or control group by permuted block random allocation. The intervention group was trained by MSR and ACT techniques for 9 weeks accomplished via WhatsApp. All participants completed the QOLQuestionnaire-12 (SF-12) items and HAI-18 before and after completing IMSR-ACT sessions. The data were analyzed through SPSS-23 software, using Chi square, independent and paired t-test, and analysis of covariance, and P-value<0.05 was considered as significant. The results showed that the intervention group compared to the control group had a significant decrease in all subscales of HAI after the intervention including worry about consequences (5.78&#xb1;2.66 vs. 7.37&#xb1;1.34, P=0.004) and awareness of bodily sensation or changes (8.90&#xb1;2.77 vs. 11.75&#xb1;2.30, P=0.001), worry about health (10.94&#xb1;2.38 vs. 13.09&#xb1;1.92, P=0.001), and total score of HAI (25.62&#xb1;4.93 vs. 32.25&#xb1;3.93, P=0.001). Also, the intervention group compared to the control group had better QOL after the intervention in general health perceptions (3.03&#xb1;0.96 vs. 2.43&#xb1;0.95, P=0.01), mental health (7.12&#xb1;2.25 vs. 6.34&#xb1;1.85 and P=0.01) and mental component summary) 16.78&#xb1;3.75 vs. 15.43&#xb1;3.05, P=0.01), physical component summary (16.06&#xb1;2.66 vs. 15.19&#xb1;2.25, P=0.01), and total score of SF-12 (32.84&#xb1;5.39 vs. 30.62&#xb1;4.34, P=0.004). Internet-delivered MSR combined with ACT could improve the HA and QOL of caregivers with patients infected by COVID-19. Thus, it can used in other similar situations for now and future. Also, it seems to be a useful approach for caregivers of the other illnesses.IRCT20180909040974N.
