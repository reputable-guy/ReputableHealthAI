Study Title: Effect of intraoperative injection of esketamine on postoperative analgesia and postoperative rehabilitation after cesarean section.

Study Summary:
Following cesarean section, a significant number of women encounter moderate to severe pain. Inadequate management of acute pain post-cesarean section can have far-reaching implications, adversely impacting maternal emotional well-being, daily activities, breastfeeding, and neonatal care. It may also impede maternal organ function recovery, leading to escalated opioid usage, heightened risk of postpartum depression, and the development of chronic postoperative pain. Both the Chinese Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines and the American ERAS Society guidelines consistently advocate for the adoption of multimodal analgesia protocols in post-cesarean section pain management. Esketamine, functioning as an antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor, has been validated for pain management in surgical patients and has exhibited effectiveness in depression treatment. Research has suggested that incorporating esketamine into postoperative pain managementpain pumps can lead to improvements in short-term depression and pain outcomes. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of administering a single dose of esketamine during cesarean section. To investigate the effect of intraoperative injection of esketamine on postoperative analgesia and postoperative rehabilitation after cesarean section. A total of 315 women undergoing elective cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia were randomized into three groups: low-dose esketamine (0.15 mg/kg), high-dose esketamine (0.25 mg/kg), and control (saline). Postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were recorded at 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were noted on 2 days, 7 days and 42 days. Ramsay sedation scores were assessed at specified intervals post-injection. Postoperative adverse reactions were also recorded. Low-dose group and high-dose group compared to control group, had significantly lower postoperative VAS pain scores at 6 hours 12 hours, and 24 hours (< 0.05), with reduced analgesic usage (< 0.05). EPDS scores and postpartum depression rates were significantly lower on 2 days and 7 days (< 0.05). No significant differences in first exhaust and defecation times were observed (> 0.05), but ambulation times were shorter (< 0.05). Ramsay scores were higher at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and upon room exit (< 0.05). Low-dose group and high-dose group had higher incidences of hallucination, lethargy, and diplopia within 2 hours (< 0.05), and with low-dose group had lower incidences of hallucination, lethargy, and diplopia than high-dose group (< 0.05). Esketamine enhances analgesia and postpartum recovery; a 0.15 mg/kg dose is optimal for cesarean sections, balancing efficacy with minimized adverse effects.
