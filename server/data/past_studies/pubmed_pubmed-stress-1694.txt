Study Title: Effectiveness of Group Health Education on "Perceived Stress" among High-School Children of Kolar: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Adolescents are exposed to various psycho-physiological stressors due to rapid changes in their bodies along with increased academic pressure, peer pressure, and pressures from other sources of society. Group health education sessions in schools could have a positive outcome in not only the way they perceive stress but also tackle it efficiently. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of group health education intervention on "perceived stress" among the high school children of Kolar. An open-label cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among high school students (8th, 9th, and 10th standard) in selected English Medium Schools of Kolar Taluk. The study was conducted in three phases spanning 5 months of duration. Phase I included baseline data collection wherein "perceived stress" level was captured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) 10 questionnaire. Phase II was the interventional phase in the form of group health education sessions. Phase III was end-line assessment. Before the intervention, 6.2%, 92.4%, and 1.5% of the students had mild, moderate, and severe stress, respectively, in the intervention group. After the intervention in the intervention group, about 57.9% had mild stress, 42.1% had moderate stress, and none had severe stress. The difference in difference analysis (DID) showed that the mean PSS scores in the intervention group changed by -8.84 while in the control group by 0.40. Group health education delivered was effective in reducing the perceived stress levels among high school children and it is a feasible and acceptable intervention for stress in school-going adolescent children.
