Study Title: Effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on well-being and work-related stress in the financial sector: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.

Study Summary:
Work-related stress is a common phenomenon, often noticed in the employees of the finance sector. It mirrors counter effects on the wellness of employees, their mental well-being, and physical health. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) raise awareness and attention to the present moment experiences by adopting coping skills. It is necessary to promote employee well-being and reduce work-related stress; hence, the need arises to associate between the level of mindfulness, employee well-being, and work-related stress. A systematic review on the effectiveness of MBIs in the finance sector is necessary to facilitate evidence for the future utility to reduce work-related stress and promote employee well-being. In this review, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized control trials, cohort, and cross-sectional and case-control studies that assess the effectiveness of MBIs on the employees in the finance sector will be considered. We propose to perform a literature search which will be conducted from the years 2000 to 2021 on CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search terms will include controlled and accessible terms such as mindfulness-based interventions, mindfulness training, workplace, employees, workers, well-being, employee wellness, occupational health, and finance sector. The outcomes will include the effect on employee well-being and reduction in work-related stress. Two researchers will independently conduct the screening and data extraction and assess the risk of bias. Based on the availability of data, a meta-analysis will also be performed. This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis-Protocol (PRISMA-P) guidelines. "Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews" will be used to assess the quality of this review. The review attempts to methodically analyse the effectiveness of MBIs among finance sector employees. It will foster to facilitate a detailed description and evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of MBIs on improving work-related stress, mindful awareness, and employee wellness and well-being in employees in the finance sector. The current study will provide an evidence base to researchers, academicians, and practitioners in the selection of mindfulness-based therapies for employees in the finance sector.
