Study Title: Targeting Aging and Longevity with Exogenous Nucleotides (TALENTs): Rationale, Design, and Baseline Characteristics from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Older Adults.

Study Summary:
Nucleotides (NTs), important biomolecules involved in numerous cellular processes, have been proposed as potential candidates for anti-aging interventions. However, whether nucleotides can act as an anti-aging supplement in older adults remains unclear. TALENTs is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that evaluates the efficacy and safety of NTs as an anti-aging supplement in older adults by exploring the effects of NTs on multiple dimensions of aging in a rigorous scientific setting. Eligible community-dwelling adults aged 60-70 years were randomly assigned equally to two groups: nucleotides intervention group and placebo control group. Comprehensive geriatric health assessments were performed at baseline, 2-months, and 4-months of the intervention. Biological specimens were collected and stored for age-related biomarker testing and multi-omics sequencing. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 4 months on leukocyte telomere length and DNA methylation age. The secondary aims were the changes in possible mechanisms underlying aging processes (immunity, inflammatory profile, oxidative stress, gene stability, endocrine, metabolism, and cardiovascular function). Other outcomes were changes in physical function, body composition and geriatric health assessment (including sleep quality, cognitive function, fatigue, frailty, and psychology). In the RCT, 301 participants were assessed for eligibility and 122 were enrolled. Participants averaged 65.65 years of age, and were predominately female (67.21%). All baseline characteristics were well-balanced between groups, as expected due to randomization. The majority of participants were pre-frailty and had at least one chronic condition. The mean scores for physical activity, psychological, fatigue and quality of life were within the normal range. However, nearly half of the participants still had room for improvement in cognitive level and sleep quality. This TALENTs trial will represent one of the most comprehensive experimental clinical trials in which supplements are administered to elderly participants. The findings of this study will contribute to our understanding of the anti-aging effects of NTs and provide insights into their potential applications in geriatric healthcare.
