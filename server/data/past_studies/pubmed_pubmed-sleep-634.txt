Study Title: Empowering people living with HIV (PLHIV): unveiling care gaps and identifying opportunities for improving care for PLHIV in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Study Summary:
This study explored the behaviours of people living with HIV in Singapore and Hong Kong in terms of achieving and maintaining their physical and psychological wellbeing in relation to HIV, to identify the challenges and support needed in HIV care. This qualitative study involved 90-minute interviews among Singapore and Hong Kong people living with HIV aged &#x2265;18 years to explore health-related quality of life perceptions and gaps in patient empowerment in HIV care during February-May 2022. The COM-B (C: Capability; O: Opportunity; M: Motivation; B: Behaviour) framework was used during data analysis to identify behaviour facilitators and barriers for people living with HIV to achieve and maintain their wellbeing. Detailed accounts of respondents' experience of living with and managing HIV, that is what worked well, unmet needs and perceived significance of wellbeing indicators, were analysed qualitatively via a combination of inductive content and deductive frameworks. A total of 30 and 28 respondents were recruited from Singapore (SG) and Hong Kong (HK), respectively. Most respondents were aged 20-49 years (SG: 83.3%; HK: 64.3%), males (SG: 96.7%; HK: 92.9%), men who have sex with men (SG: 93.3%; HK: 71.4%), had university or higher education (SG: 73.3%; HK: 50.0%) and were fully employed (SG: 73.3%; HK: 57.1%). In both Singapore and Hong Kong, physical health was considered a key focus of overall wellbeing, albeit attention to long-term health associated with cardiovascular and renal health was less salient. The impact of symptoms, side effects of treatment, mood and sleep were among the top wellbeing indicators of importance. Respondents felt that insufficient information was provided by physicians, citing consultation time and resource constraints impeding further expression of concerns to their physicians during consultation. Respondents prioritized functional wellness and delegated psychosocial health to supportive care professionals, patient groups, families and/or friends. There is a need in Singapore and Hong Kong to empower people living with HIV to establish better communications with their physicians and be more involved in their treatment journey and equally prioritize their psychosocial wellbeing.
