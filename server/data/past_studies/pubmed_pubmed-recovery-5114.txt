Study Title: The mechanism of transcutaneous gastric pacing treatment on gastrointestinal motility recovery and inflammation improvement in early-stage acute pancreatitis patients.

Study Summary:
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is often accompanied by gastrointestinal motility disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and possible mechanism of transcutaneous gastric pacing (TGP) in early-stage AP patients. Sixty-five AP patients were randomly divided into conventional treatment group and TGP group. The serum ghrelin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were used to assess the possible gastrointestinal hormonal mechanism involved. The parameters of electrogastrogram (EGG) were used to evaluate the gastric motility in AP patients. The first defecation time was used to assess the recovery of intestinal motility. The heart rate variability (HRV) test was performed to assess autonomic nervous function. Compared with the conventional treatment group, the TGP treatment significantly improved symptoms in early AP patients, and shortened the first defecation time (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and the hospital days (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The level of VIP (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) was also decreased in TGP group. The percentage of normal gastric slow waves (GSWS) (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) was increased. The interleukin (IL)-6 level was decreased (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Concurrently, the vagal activity (HF) was increased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), the sympathetic activity (LF) was decreased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), and the ratio of sympathetic vagal (LF/HF) was decreased (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). The TGP treatment significantly improves the clinical symptoms in early AP patients. It also increases the percentage of normal GSWS. The therapeutic effect of TGP may be caused by autonomic nervous function mechanisms.
