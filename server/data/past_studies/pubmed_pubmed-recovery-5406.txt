Study Title: The Association of the Essential Amino Acids Lysine, Methionine, and Threonine with Clinical Outcomes in Patients at Nutritional Risk: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.

Study Summary:
Lysine, methionine, and threonine are essential amino acids with vital functions for muscle and connective tissue health, metabolic balance, and the immune system. During illness, the demand for these amino acids typically increases, which puts patients at risk for deficiencies with harmful clinical consequences. In a secondary analysis of the Effect of Early Nutritional Support on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of Malnourished Medical Inpatients Trial (EFFORT), which compared individualized nutritional support to usual care nutrition in patients at nutritional risk, we investigated the prognostic impact of the lysine, methionine, and threonine metabolism. We had complete clinical and amino acid data in 237 patients, 58 of whom reached the primary endpoint of death at 30 days. In a model adjusted for comorbidities, sex, nutritional risk, and trial intervention, low plasma methionine levels were associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.98 [95% CI 1.16 to 3.36],= 0.01) and with a decline in functional status (adjusted OR 2.06 [95% CI 1.06 to 4.01],= 0.03). The results for lysine and threonine did not show statistically significant differences regarding clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that low levels of methionine may be critical during hospitalization among patients at nutritional risk. Further studies should investigate the effect of supplementation of methionine in this patient group to improve outcomes.
