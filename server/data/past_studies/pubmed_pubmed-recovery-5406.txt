Study Title: Acute Dosing Strategy with Vistula Tart Cherries for Recovery of Strenuous Exercise-A Feasibility Study.

Study Summary:
Tart cherry (TC) consumption has become a popular nutritional strategy for recovery, particularly for the attenuation of markers associated with muscle damage. However, there are relatively few studies that have examined an acute dosing strategy. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the feasibility of using powdered Vistula TC for recovery following a bout of muscle-damaging exercise. Twenty-two recreationally active participants (mean &#xb1; SD age, stature, and mass were 23 &#xb1; 3 years old, 173 &#xb1; 10 cm, and 74 &#xb1; 17 kg, respectively) performed 40 (5 sets of 8 repetitions) maximal lengthening contractions of the elbow flexors. The participants were randomised to receive either a spray-dried TC extract or a calorie-matched placebo (12 TC, 10 placebo) for 4 days in total, starting on the day of exercise. Dependent measures of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), muscle soreness (assessed via visual analogue scales; VAS), pain pressure threshold (PPT), range of motion (ROM), and upper arm limb girth were taken at baseline (pre), 24, 48, and 72 h post damaging exercise. There were significant changes over time among all the variables (MVC, VAS, PPT, ROM, and girth,&#x2264; 0.014). There were no significant differences between the conditions for any of the variables (MVC, VAS, PPT, ROM, and girth,> 0.3). The TC group did not recover at an accelerated rate compared to the placebo. This study provides initial insights into the use of powdered Vistula TC and its effect following strenuous (damaging) exercise bouts. Vistula TC did not improve recovery when taken acutely following a bout of damaging exercise to the elbow flexors.
