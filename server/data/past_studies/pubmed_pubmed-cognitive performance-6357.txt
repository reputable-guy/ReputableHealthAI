Study Title: Long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation and cognitive performance throughout adulthood: A 6-month randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate whether omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) supplementation improve cognitive performance and if apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype or age were effect modifiers. Healthy adults of 20 to 80 years old (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;193) were completed a 6-month double-blind randomized controlled trial with two groups: 2.5&#xa0;g/day of n-3 PUFA or a placebo. Primary outcomes were visuospatial ability and working memory and secondary outcomes were episodic memory and executive function, measured at baseline and 6 months. Cognitive performances did not significantly differ between groups on primary or secondary outcomes after 6 months of treatment. APOE carriers and age were not effect modifiers for any outcomes. Those with low episodic memory scores and taking the n-3 PUFA supplement, significantly improved their scores (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.043). A 6-month n-3 PUFA supplementation did not improve cognitive performance in cognitively healthy adults and APOE status or age were not effect modifiers.
