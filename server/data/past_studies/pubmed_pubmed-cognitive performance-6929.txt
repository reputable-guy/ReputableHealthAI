Study Title: Cognitive Performance Does not Limit Physical Activity Participation in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot Study (LIFE-P).

Study Summary:
We examined whether multiple domains of baseline cognitive performance were associated with prospective physical activity (PA) adherence in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot study (LIFE-P). The LIFE-P study was a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of a PA intervention compared to a successful aging educational intervention in sedentary, mobility-limited older adults. A 12-month structured, moderate-intensity, multi-modal PA program that included walking, resistance training, and flexibility exercises. For the first 2 months (adoption), 3 center-based exercise sessions (40-60 min) / week were conducted. During the next 4 months (transition), center-based sessions were conducted 2 times / week. The subsequent maintenance phase consisted of optional once-to-twice-per-week center-based sessions and home-based PA. Tests of executive and global cognitive functioning, working memory and psychomotor speed were administered at baseline. Median test scores were used to dichotomize participants into low or high cognitive performance groups. 52 mobility-limited older adults (age: 76.9 &#xb1;5 yrs) were randomized to the PA arm of LIFE-P. Compared to participants with high cognitive performance, participants with low performance had similar PA adherence rates (all P &#x2265; 0.34). Furthermore, weak and non-significant univariate relationships were elicited between all measures of cognition and overall PA adherence levels (r values ranged: -0.20 to 0.12, P &#x2265; 0.12). These data suggest that cognitive performance does not limit long-term PA adherence in mobility-limited older adults. Additional studies in larger cohorts are warranted to verify these findings.
