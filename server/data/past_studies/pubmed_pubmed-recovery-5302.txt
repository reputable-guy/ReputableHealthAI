Study Title: Acustimulation combined with pharmacological prophylaxis versus pharmacological prophylaxis alone in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis among patients undergoing laparoscopy abdominal surgery: a research protocol for a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
This study evaluates the efficacy of integrating percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation at the pericardium 6 (PC6) acupuncture point through a wearable acustimulation device with standard pharmacological prophylaxis to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery. This prospective study will enrol 302 patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: acustimulation combined with pharmacological prophylaxis or sham stimulation combined with pharmacological prophylaxis. Randomisation will involve a computer-generated sequence, with allocation concealment implemented through sealed envelopes. The acustimulation group will receive electrical stimulation at the PC6 point starting 30&#x2009;min before surgery and continuing until discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit. Sham group will wear a wristband that does not provide stimulation. The primary outcome is the incidence of PONV. Secondary outcomes include the severity of PONV, incidence rates of nausea and vomiting at different postoperative intervals and indices of gastrointestinal functional recovery. Exploratory outcomes will assess haemodynamic parameters, baroreflex sensitivity, hospital stay duration, costs and both short-term and long-term postoperative recovery. All participants will provide written informed consent. The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical Hospital (approval number: I-23PJ1712). Results will be published open access. NCT06241547.
