Study Title: Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation with concurrent cognitive performance targeting posterior parietal cortex vs prefrontal cortex on working memory in schizophrenia: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Working memory deficits are linked to irregularities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in schizophrenia, effective intervention strategies are lacking. We evaluated the differential efficacy and underlying neuromechanisms of targeting transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at the DLPFC and the PPC with concurrent cognitive performance for working memory in schizophrenia. In a randomized and double-blind clinical trial, sixty clinically stable schizophrenic patients with below-average working memory were randomly assigned to active DLPFC, active PPC, and sham tDCS groups. Two sessions of tDCS during N-back task were delivered daily for five days. The primary outcome was changes in spatial span test scores from baseline to week 1. The secondary outcomes included changes in scores of color delay-estimation task, other cognitive tasks, and mismatch negativity (biomarker of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor functioning). Compared with the active DLPFC group, the active PPC group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in spatial span test scores (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.94) and an augmentation in color delay-estimation task capacity at week 1; the latter sustained to week 2. Compared with the sham tDCS group, the active PPC group did not show a significant improvement in spatial span test scores at week 1 and 2; however, significant enhancement was observed in their color delay-estimation task capacity at week 2. Additionally, mismatch negativity amplitude was enhanced, and changes in theta band measures were positively correlated with working memory improvement in the active PPC group, while no such correlations were observed in the active DLPFC group or the sham tDCS group. Our results suggest that tDCS targeting the PPC relative to the DLPFC during concurrent cognitive performance may improve working memory in schizophrenia, meriting further investigation. The improvement in working memory appears to be linked to enhanced N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor functioning.
