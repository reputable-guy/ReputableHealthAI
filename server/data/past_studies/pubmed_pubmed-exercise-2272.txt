Study Title: The Effect of Multi-Ingredient Protein versus Collagen Supplementation on Satellite Cell Properties in Males and Females.

Study Summary:
Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SC) contribute to the adaptive process of resistance exercise training (RET) and may be influenced by nutritional supplementation. However, little research exists on the impact of multi-ingredient supplementation on the SC response to RET. We tested the effect of a multi-ingredient supplement (MIS) including whey protein, creatine, leucine, calcium citrate, and vitamin D on SC content and activity as well as myonuclear accretion, SC and myonuclear domain compared with a collagen control (COL) throughout a 10-wk RET program. Twenty-six participants underwent a 10-wk linear RET program while consuming either the MIS or COL supplement twice daily. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis at baseline and 48 h after a bout of damaging exercise, before and after RET. Muscle tissue was analyzed for SC and myonuclear content, domain, acute SC activation, and fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA). MIS resulted in a greater increase in type II fCSA following 10 wk of RET (effect size (ES) = 0.89) but not myonuclear accretion or SC content. Change in myonuclei per fiber was positively correlated with type I and II and total fiber hypertrophy in the COL group only, indicating a robust independent effect of MIS on fCSA. Myonuclear domain increased similarly in both groups, whereas SC domain remained unchanged following RET. SC activation was similar between groups for all fiber types in the untrained state but showed a trend toward greater increases with MIS after RET (ES = 0.70). SC responses to acute damaging exercise and long-term RET are predominantly similar in MIS and COL groups. However, MIS can induce greater increases in type II fCSA with RET and potentially SC activation following damage in the trained state.
