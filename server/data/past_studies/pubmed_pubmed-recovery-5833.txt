Study Title: [Comparison of the effects of sciatic nerve block combined with continuted femoral nerve block or continuted adductor canal block on pain and motor function after total knee arthroplasty].

Study Summary:
To compare the effect of sciatic nerve block (SNB) combined with continuted femoral nerve block (FNB) or continuted adductor canal block (ACB) on pain and motor function after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A total of 60 patients with TKA-treated osteoarthritis of the knee who met the selection criteria were enrolled between November 2020 and February 2021 and randomised allocated into the study group (SNB combined with continuted ACB) and the control group (SNB combined with continuted FNB), with 30 cases in each group. There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass, height, body mass index, preoperative Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, femoral tibial angle, and medial proximal tibial angle between the two groups (>0.05). The operation time, the initial time to the ground, the initial walking distance, and the postoperative hospital stay were recorded. At 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after operation, the numerical rating scale (NRS) score was used to evaluate the rest pain around the knee joint, the quadriceps femoris muscle strength was evaluated by the freehand muscle strength method, and the knee flexion and extension angles were measured. There was no significant difference in the operation time and initial walking distance between the two groups (>0.05); the initial time to the ground and postoperative hospital stay of the study group were significantly shorter than those of the control group (<0.05). Except for the 48-hour postoperative NRS score of the study group, which was significantly lower than that of the control group (<0.05), there was no significant difference in the NRS scores between the two groups at the remaining time points (>0.05). The quadriceps femoris muscle strength from 4 to 24 hours postoperatively and the knee extension angle from 2 to 6 hours postoperatively of the study group were significantly better than those of the control group (<0.05); the differences in the quadriceps femoris muscle strength and knee extension and flexion angles between the two groups at the remaining time points were not significant (>0.05). SNB combined with either continuted ACB or continuted FNB can effectively relieve pain in patients after TKA, and compared with combined continuted FNB, combined continuted ACB has less effect on quadriceps femoris muscle strength, and patients have better recovery of knee flexion and extension mobility.
