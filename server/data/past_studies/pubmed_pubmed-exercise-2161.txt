Study Title: Various apolipoprotein E genotypes relate to responsiveness to flaxseed lignan complex in older persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Study Summary:
The objective of the study was to determine if there would be statistically significant differences or trends among apolipoprotein E genotypes in the responsiveness of members of a cluster of seven measures in older persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) consuming flaxseed lignan complex (FLC). The cluster of seven are abdominal obesity, hypertension, platelet hyperaggregability, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia (decreased plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), and increased plasma levels of triglycerides), increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and increased inflammation. All cluster members exacerbate T2DM.Sixteen patients with well-controlled T2DM participated in this double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study consisting of four visits. Apolipoprotein E genotyping was done at visit one. The cluster of seven, diet, exercise, smoking and medication use were assessed at each visit.The 3/4 genotype showed a stronger downward trend in systolic blood pressure compared to the 3/3 genotype with no trend or significant difference in the 2/4 genotype. There was a downward trend in diastolic blood pressure in genotype 3/3 compared genotype 2/4, which showed no significant difference or trend. Only genotype 3/4 showed a significant drop in diastolic pressure compared to genotypes 2/4 and 3/3. HDLc only showed a downward trend in 3/4 relative to genotypes 2/4 and 3/3. LDL apolipoprotein B oxidation (LDL-Box) only showed an upward trend in 3/3 compared to genotypes 2/4 and 3/4. There were no other significant differences or trends by genotype in the cluster of seven.It appears that those with the 2/4 genotype may not benefit from FLC, those with 3/3 and 3/4 genotypes may benefit only in terms of systolic and diastolic pressures, those with the apo E 3/4 genotype should perhaps avoid FLC to manage HDLc, and those with the 3/3 genotype should perhaps avoid FLC to manage LDL apolipoprotein B oxidation.
