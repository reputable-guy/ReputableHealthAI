Study Title: Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation with or without an unrelated cord blood unit for adult acute myeloid leukemia: a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial.

Study Summary:
Coinfusion of unrelated cord blood (UCB) units in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) (haplo-cord HCT) for hematopoietic malignancies showed promising results in previous reports, but the efficiency of haplo-cord HCT in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still lacks sufficient evidence. This multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03719534) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of haplo-cord HCT in AML patients. A total of 268 eligible patients aged 18-60 years, diagnosed with measurable residual disease in AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia), with available haploidentical donors and suitable for allotransplantation, were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive haplo-cord HCT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;134) or haplo-HCT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;134). The 3-year overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint in this study. Overall median follow-up was 36.50 months (IQR 24.75-46.50). The 3-year OS of Haplo-cord HCT group was better than haplo-HCT group (80.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.7-87.9 vs. 67.8% 95% CI 60.0-76.5, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013). Favorable progression-free survival (70.3%, 95% CI 62.6-78.8 vs. 57.6%, 95% CI 49.6-67.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012) and cumulative incidence of relapse (12.1%, 95% CI 12.0-12.2 vs. 30.3%, 95% CI 30.1-30.4, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024) were observed in haplo-cord HCT group. Grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) within two years posttransplantation in the two groups were similar. Haplo-cord HCT patients exhibited a faster cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026) and increased T-cell reconstitution in the early period posttransplantation. Haplo-cord HCT can improve OS in AML patients without excessive AEs, which may exert additional benefits for recipients of haplo-HCT.
