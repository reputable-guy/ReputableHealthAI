Study Title: The Impact of Comprehensive Nursing and Warming Measures on Emergence Agitation and Maternal-Neonatal Safety in Women Undergoing General Anesthesia for Cesarean Section.

Study Summary:
To explore the effects of comprehensive nursing combined with thermal insulation measures on the awakening agitation (EA) of cesarean section parturient under general anesthesia and maternal and infant safety. A total of 136 cesarean section parturients under general anesthesia admitted in our hospital from May 2020 to November 2023 were picked as the research objects following the random, double-blind method. All patients have no mental illness and can clearly reflect their physical state. The subjects were randomized into the study group and the control group in accordance with the random number table method, with 68 cases in each group. The control group was intervened with thermal insulation measures, while the study group was intervened with comprehensive nursing combined with thermal insulation measures. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) at different time points were compared. The Ramsay score (RASS), the incidence of EA, and the incidence of shivering were compared. The influence of comprehensive nursing combined with thermal insulation measures on maternal and infant safety and their recovery after the operation was analyzed. The adverse psychological status and postoperative satisfaction of the two groups were statistically analyzed. SBP, DBP, and MAP in the study group were much higher than those in the control group at the time of skin incision, fetal delivery, and the end of operation (P < .05). Compared with the control group, the study group had much higher RASS, and sharply reduced incidence of EA and shivering (P < .05). The incidence of fetal distress, postpartum hemorrhage, neonatal asphyxia, etc., was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group P < .05). Parturient of the study group had a shorter duration of hospitalization, shorter detention time in the anesthesia monitoring room, and awakening time than the parturient in the control group (P < .05). The SAS and SDS scores of parturient were significantly decreased in the two groups at discharge than before the operation, and a more obvious decrease was found in the study group (P < .01). Postoperative satisfaction of the study group and the control group was 98.53% and 80.88%, respectively, which was markedly higher in the study group than in the control group (P < .05). Comprehensive nursing combined with thermal insulation measures vastly improved the sedation degree of parturient, reduced the incidence of EA and chills, ensured maternal and infant safety, reduced adverse pregnancy outcomes, promoted early recovery of parturient, and enhanced maternal satisfaction. This conclusion provides important guidance for improving clinical practice, emphasizing the key role of comprehensive care in improving surgical outcomes and patient comfort, thereby improving the quality and efficiency of medical services.
