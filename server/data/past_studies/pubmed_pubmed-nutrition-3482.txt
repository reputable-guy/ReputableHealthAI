Study Title: Safety and Suitability of Infant Formula Manufactured from Extensively Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Compared to Intact Protein: A Combined Analysis of Two Randomized Controlled Studies.

Study Summary:
Our aim was to assess the nutritional safety and suitability of an infant formula manufactured from extensively hydrolyzed protein in comparison to infant formula manufactured from intact protein (both with low and standard protein content). We performed a combined analysis of raw data from two randomized infant feeding studies. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to determine the non-inferiority of daily weight gain (primary outcome; margin -3 g/day), with the intervention group as a fixed factor and geographic region, sex, and baseline weight as covariates (main model). The data of 346 infants exposed to the formula were included in the analysis. The sample size of the per-protocol analysis with 184 infants was too small to achieve sufficient statistical power. The lower limit of the 97.5% confidence interval (-0.807) of the mean group difference in daily weight gain (i.e., 2.22 g/day) was above the -3 g/day margin (full analysis set). Further anthropometric parameters did not differ between the infant formula groups throughout the study. Growth was comparable to breastfed infants. We conclude that the infant formula manufactured from extensively hydrolyzed protein meets infant requirements for adequate growth and does not raise any safety concerns.
