Study Title: Prevalence, clinical characteristics, and disease burden of chronic cough in Italy: a cross-sectional study.

Study Summary:
Chronic cough has been associated with reduced health-related quality of life, negative impacts on sleep, work, and other daily activities, and increased use of health care resources. Little is known about the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy. In the present study we sought to estimate the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy, describe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with chronic cough, and characterize the impact of chronic cough on overall health and wellness, work and other daily activities, and health care resource use. We conducted a cross-sectional study to collect sociodemographic and health-related data from Italian residents who participated in the 2020 National Health and Wellness Survey (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;10,026). To assess the characteristics and burden of chronic cough, adults who indicated that they had experienced chronic cough during the prior 12 months were compared with propensity score-matched controls without chronic cough. The estimated weighted lifetime and 12-month prevalence of chronic cough were estimated as 9.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Compared with matched controls, respondents with chronic cough had significantly lower measures of overall physical and mental health (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001 for both comparisons), and significantly higher rates of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001 for all comparisons). Chronic cough was significantly associated with higher rates of impairment of work and other activities (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001 for all comparisons) in the past 7 days, any-cause emergency department visits and hospitalizations in the prior 6 months (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001 for both comparisons), and more visits to general and specialist health care providers (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001 for both comparisons) in the prior 6 months. In Italy, chronic cough affects an estimated 3.3&#xa0;million adults annually and represents a significant burden to individuals and the health care system. Little is known about the prevalence of chronic cough in Italy. We found that, in Italy chronic cough represents a significant burden to individuals and the health care system, affecting an estimated 3.3&#xa0;million adults annually.
