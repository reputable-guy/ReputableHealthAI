Study Title: The effects of inhaled flavors on intravenous nicotine.

Study Summary:
Menthol is the only available flavor in combusted tobacco cigarettes; however, e-cigarettes are available in thousands of flavors. Research on flavors and rewarding properties of nicotine is limited. The present study sought to examine the acute rewarding effects of flavors inhaled from an e-cigarette, in combination with intravenous (IV) nicotine among cigarette smokers. In the present study, 24 menthol-preferring young adult (aged 18 to 30) cigarette smokers were tested under 3 different e-cigarette flavor conditions (menthol, green apple, or menthol + green apple) in a within-subject cross-over design. During each test session, each participant received 3 IV infusions (saline, 0.25 mg/70 kg nicotine, 0.5 mg/70 kg nicotine) administered 1 hr apart. The main outcome measures assessed cardiovascular, subjective, and cognitive domains. Compared with green apple or green apple + menthol, menthol produced higher ratings of "cooling" (s < 0.01). Craving was rated higher following administration of green apple and the combined menthol + apple flavor compared to menthol alone (s < 0.05). As expected, IV-nicotine dose-dependently increased the ratings of subjective liking/disliking and peak heart rate, improved cognitive performance, and reduced smoking urges (alls < 0.05). These subjective, cognitive, and physiological effects of nicotine were not affected by any flavor condition. The present findings did not support an interaction between IV-nicotine dose and inhaled flavor for acute effects of nicotine. Green apple flavor, alone or in combination with menthol, could result in higher craving or insufficiently alleviate craving, relative to menthol flavor alone. Additional research is warranted to examine extended exposure to inhaled flavors on the rewarding and addictive effects of nicotine. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).
