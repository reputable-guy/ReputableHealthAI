Study Title: Mitigating the Stigma of Mental Illness: The Impact of Story-Telling in the Black Community.

Study Summary:
Racial/ethnic minorities, including the Black community, experience stigma as a significant barrier to mental health care, with fears of being devalued or discriminated against deterring individuals from seeking help. Racial stigma further exacerbates mental health issues and negatively influences perceptions of service utilization. To address this, our research team partnered with a national non-profit storytelling organization to develop and evaluate a virtual narrative storytelling intervention series that amplifies the voices and experiences of Black Americans living with mental illness and addiction. We randomly assigned 193 participants to either the intervention (n = 102) or an active control condition (n = 91) and used a pre-post survey design to assess the changes in the outcome variables. Contrary to our hypothesis, there were no race-based interactions; instead, the results show significant reductions in public stigma and perceived discrimination and increased positive attitudes toward seeking treatment universally among all the intervention participants. This study provided preliminary evidence that a virtual storytelling intervention is instrumental across varied demographic cohorts, transcending potential cultural barriers in the discourse and understanding of mental health to effectively mitigate stigma and improve attitudes toward mental health treatment.
