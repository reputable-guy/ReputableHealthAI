Study Title: The Motor Engram of Functional Connectivity Generated by Acute Whole-Body Dynamic Balance Training.

Study Summary:
Whole-body dynamic balance is necessary for both athletic activities and activities of daily living. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acute dynamic balance training on neural networks. We evaluated resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC), white matter fiber density, fiber-bundle cross-section, and gray matter volume in 28 healthy young adults (14 women) before and after 30 min of slackline training using a randomized, counterbalanced crossover design. The rs-FC between the left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the foot area of the primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex increased significantly after slackline training compared with that after a control condition involving ergometer-based aerobic exercise. In addition, changes in rs-FC between the left lateral PFC and the primary sensorimotor were correlated with performance changes after training (i.e., offline process) rather than online learning. We also observed a main effect of time between the hippocampus and the cingulate cortex, including the anterior areas, and between the bilateral lateral PFC. Although we observed no structural changes, fiber density in the commissural fiber pathway before the first balance assessment was correlated with initial balance capability. Our findings demonstrate that acute whole-body dynamic balance training alters specific rs-FC, and that this change is associated with performance changes after training. In addition, rs-FC changes in cognitive regions were modulated by both acute dynamic balance training and aerobic exercise. These findings have the potential to influence various fields (e.g., sports neuroscience, neurorehabilitation) and may aid in the development of methods that can improve motor and cognitive performance.
