Study Title: Dietary composition of adult eosinophilic esophagitis patients is related to disease severity.

Study Summary:
In addition to the elimination diet, dietary composition may influence disease severity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) through modulation of the immune response. To explore the immunomodulatory role of nutrition before and during elimination diet in adult EoE patients. Nutritional intake was assessed in 39 Dutch adult EoE patients participating in the Supplemental Elemental Trial&#xa0;(Dutch trial registry NL6014, NTR6778) using 3-day food diaries. In this randomized controlled trial, diagnosed patients received either a four-food elimination diet alone (FFED) or FFED with addition of an amino acid-based formula for 6 weeks. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess associations between the intake of nutrients and food groups per 1000&#x2009;kCal and peak eosinophil count/high power field (PEC), both at baseline and after 6 weeks. At baseline, we found a statistically significant negative (thus favorable) relationship between the intake of protein, total fat, phosphorus, zinc, vitamin B12, folate, and milk products and PEC (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05), while calcium (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.058) and full-fat cheese/curd (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.056) were borderline (favorably) significant. In contrast, total carbohydrates, prepacked fruit juice, and white bread were significantly positively (unfavorable) related to PEC (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05), while ultra-processed meals (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.059) were borderline (unfavorably) significant. After dietary intervention, coffee/tea were significantly negatively (favorably) related to PEC, hummus/legumes were significantly positively (unfavorably) related with PEC, while peanuts were borderline significantly positively related (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.058). Dietary composition may be related to inflammation in adult EoE patients. High-quality and anti-inflammatory diets may be a promising adjuvant therapy in the dietary management of EoE.
