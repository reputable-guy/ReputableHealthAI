Study Title: Fascia Iliaca Block Combined with Low-dose Spinal Anesthesia for Hip Fracture Surgery in the Elderly: Effects on Severe Hypotension and Analgesia. A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Hip fracture surgeries in elderly patients often require spinal or general anesthesia, posing risks of severe hypotension and inadequate pain management. The optimal anesthesia type for minimizing these risks remains undetermined. Preliminary studies suggest that a combination of fascia iliaca block (FIB) and low-dose low-specific-gravity spinal anesthesia (LLSA) might offer a solution, but comprehensive evidence is lacking. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of combining FIB with LLSA for reducing severe hypotension and enhancing analgesia during hip fracture surgery in elderly patients. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted. An operating theatre of a tertiary hospital. The study comprised 68 patients. They were separated into 2 equal parallel groups 34 patients each: the FIB+LLSA group and the general anesthesia (GA) group. Patients aged 75-96 undergoing primary hip arthroplasty for hip fracture were randomized to receive either FIB+LLSA or GA. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe hypotension; secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, use of rescue analgesia, vasopressor dosage, and complications. We found a significantly lower incidence of severe hypotension in the FIB+LLSA group compared to the GA group (32.4% vs 67.6%). Additionally, postoperative pain scores were significantly lower, and the need for rescue analgesia was reduced in the FIB+LLSA group. Vasopressor use during surgery was also significantly lower in the FIB+LLSA group. The hospital stay was shorter in the FIB+LLSA group, with an average of 5.9 days compared to 6.7 days in the GA group. The study's limitations include its single-center nature, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the inability to conduct a double-blind study could introduce biases, though measures were taken to minimize this. The sample size might not be sufficient to determine the broader implications of LLSA. Combining FIB with LLSA for elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery significantly reduces the incidence of severe intraoperative hypotension and postoperative pain. It also decreases the need for rescue analgesia and shortens hospital stays, suggesting that FIB+LLSA could be a beneficial regional anesthesia technique for elderly hip fracture surgery patients, aligning with enhanced recovery protocols.
