Study Title: Five-year follow-up of the OptiTrain trial on concurrent resistance and high-intensity interval training during chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer.

Study Summary:
The protocol predefined aim of this study is to assess sustained effects of the OptiTrain trial on several health outcomes, 5 years after the baseline assessment. The OptiTrain study was a prospective, randomised controlled trial with 240 patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy that compared the effects of 16&#xa0;weeks of two exercise programs, RT-HIIT and AT-HIIT, with usual care (UC). After a 5-year follow-up, eligible participants were evaluated for the primary outcome of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and secondary outcomes including quality of life, symptoms, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Statistical analysis was conducted using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline values. Tumour profile and menopausal status were additionally adjusted for CRF. Mean differences (MD), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and standardized effect sizes (ES) were reported. At the 5-year follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences in total CRF between the intervention groups and the UC group. RT-HIIT reported significantly reduced pain sensitivity at the gluteus MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;79.00 (95% CI 10.17, 147.83, ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.55) compared to UC. Clinically meaningful differences for an increase in cognitive CRF and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed for the AT-HIIT versus UC group, and for lower limb strength for the RT-HIIT versus UC group, albeit without statistical significance. Engaging in targeted exercise during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer provides short-term benefits in reducing fatigue and maintaining physical function. However, our 5-year follow-up indicates that these effects are limited in the long term. This underscores the need to support breast cancer survivors maintain their PA levels throughout their survivorship journey.
