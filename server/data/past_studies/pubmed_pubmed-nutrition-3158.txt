Study Title: Examination of sex-specific interactions between gut microbiota and host metabolism after 12-week combined polyphenol supplementation in individuals with overweight or obesity.

Study Summary:
Polyphenols exert beneficial effects on host metabolism, which may be mediated by the gut microbiota. We investigated sex-specific differences in microbiota composition and interactions with cardiometabolic parameters after polyphenol supplementation in individuals with overweight/obesity. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 19 women and 18 men with normal glucose tolerance and body mass index&#x2009;>25&#x2009;kg/mreceived epigallocatechin-3-gallate and resveratrol (EGCG+RES, 282&#x2009;+&#x2009;80&#x2009;mg/d) or placebo supplements for 12&#x2009;weeks. Fecal microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, V3-V4 region),whole-body fat oxidation (indirect calorimetry), and mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers (SkM-Ox;respirometry) were determined pre- and post-intervention. Overall, EGCG+RES supplementation did not affect gut microbiota composition., andwere more abundant, while, and an uncultured Ruminococcaceae family genus were less abundant in women compared to men. In women, only baselineabundance correlated with EGCG+RES-induced changes in SkM-Ox. In men, low,,,,,,, and afamily genus abundance, and highabundance at baseline were associated with improvements in SkM-Ox. Changes in whole-body fat oxidation were not associated with gut microbiota features. We conclude that baseline microbiota composition predicts changes in SkM-Ox as a result of EGCG+RES supplementation in men but not in women. Men may be more prone to diet-induced, gut microbiota-related improvements in cardiometabolic health. These sex-differences should be further investigated in future precision-based intervention studies.
