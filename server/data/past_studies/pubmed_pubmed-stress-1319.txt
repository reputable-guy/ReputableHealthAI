Study Title: Perceived Health Benefits of Nature Prescriptions on Employee Health and Wellness.

Study Summary:
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a nature prescription program on mental, physical, and social health offered to Salt Lake County employees. The program was conducted in two separate phases during 2020 and 2021 by a wellness program for Salt Lake County employees. Participants received a nature prescription and bi-weekly newsletters, and were offered additional wellness benefits for completing weekly prescriptions. Data were collected by a post-survey that assessed participants' time spent outdoors, perceived health benefits (physical, mental, and social), and perceived benefit of the nature prescription program. Due to the post only study design, descriptive statistics were calculated and analyzed. About two-thirds of participants were female. Of the 285 participants who completed the 2020 post-survey, the majority reported improved mood, decreased stress and sedentary behavior, improved anxiety and relationships with others, and increased energy. In addition, almost half reported improved cognition and an increased connection with their community. Of the 143 first-time participants who completed the 2021 post-survey, similar results were found where the majority reported improved mood and relationships with others, decreased stress and sedentary behavior, and increased energy. The cost of the 2020 program, aside from employee salary, was US$1.52 per completed participant. The success of this program provides evidence to suggest that incorporating nature prescriptions into employee wellness programs is both beneficial and cost effective.
