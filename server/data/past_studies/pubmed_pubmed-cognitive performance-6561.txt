Study Title: Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of brain injury, inflammation and synaptic autoimmunity predict long-term neurocognitive outcome in herpes simplex encephalitis.

Study Summary:
The aim was to investigate the correlation between biomarkers of brain injury and long-term neurocognitive outcome, and the interplay with intrathecal inflammation and neuronal autoimmunity, in patients with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). A total of 53 adult/adolescent HSE patients were included from a prospective cohort in a randomized placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of a 3-month follow-up treatment with valaciclovir. Study subjects underwent repeated serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling and brain magnetic resonance imaging in the first 3&#xa0;months along with cognitive assessment using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) at 24&#xa0;months. CSF samples were analysed for biomarkers of brain injury, inflammation and synaptic autoimmunity. The predefined primary analysis was the correlation between peak CSF neurofilament protein (NFL), a biomarker of neuronal damage, and MDRS at 24&#xa0;months. Impaired cognitive performance significantly correlated with NFL levels (rho&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.36, p = 0.020). Development of IgG anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NDMAR) antibodies was associated with a broad and prolonged proinflammatory CSF response. In a linear regression model, lower MDRS at 24&#xa0;months was associated with previous development of IgG anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) (beta&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.6249, p = 0.024) and age (z-score beta&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.2784, p = 0.024), but not CSF NFL, which however significantly correlated with subsequent NMDAR autoimmunization (p = 0.006). Our findings show that NFL levels are predictive of long-term neurocognitive outcome in HSE, and suggest a causative chain of events where brain tissue damage increases the risk of NMDAR autoimmunisation and subsequent prolongation of CSF inflammation. The data provides guidance for a future intervention study of immunosuppressive therapy administered in the recovery phase of HSE.
