Study Title: Azathioprine Plus Exclusive Enteral Nutrition Versus Azathioprine Monotherapy for the Prevention of Postoperative Recurrence in Patients with Crohn's Disease: An Open-Label, Single-Centre, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Azathioprine [AZA] effectively prevents postoperative endoscopic recurrence [ER] in Crohn's disease [CD]. However, the efficacy of AZA emerges after 3 months. Exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN] can maintain remission in CD. The present trial investigates whether AZA plus postoperative 3-month EEN is superior to AZA alone in preventing ER of CD. In total, 84 high-risk CD patients undergoing intestinal resection received AZA alone or AZA plus 3 months of EEN [AZA&#x2005;+&#x2005;EEN] postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of ER at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included the rate of ER at 3 months, clinical recurrence [CR], CD activity index [CDAI] scores, faecal calprotectin [FC], and C-reactive protein [CRP]. Quality of life was assessed using Short Form-36 [SF-36] and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ]. Patients in the AZA&#x2005;+&#x2005;EEN group exhibited significantly lower rates of ER compared to the AZA group at both 12 months (33.3% [13/39] vs 63.2% [24/38], P&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.009) and 3 months (8.6% [3/35] vs 28.1% [9/32], P&#x2005;=&#x2005;0.037) post-surgery. The rates of CR between the two groups at 3 and 12 months were similar. CDAI scores, FC, albumin level, and CRP were all comparable between the two groups. Quality of life was significantly higher in the AZA group than in the AZA&#x2005;+&#x2005;EEN group at 3 months but became comparable from 5 to 12 months postoperatively. In high-risk CD patients, combining AZA with postoperative 3-month EEN reduces 1-year ER but may temporarily impact quality of life. Further large-scale, long-term studies are warranted.
