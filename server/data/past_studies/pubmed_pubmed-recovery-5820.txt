Study Title: [Effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation on postoperative cough in lung cancer patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery].

Study Summary:
To evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) for alleviating postoperative cough in lung cancer patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A total of 110 patients with lung cancer undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were randomly divided into a TEAS group (55 cases, 2 cases dropped out) and a sham-TEAS group (55 cases, 4 cases dropped out). In the TEAS group, TEAS was delivered 30 min before anesthesia and on day 1 to day 4 after operation separately, with disperse-dense wave, in frequence of 2 Hz/100 Hz. The acupoints included Feishu (BL 13), Pishu (BL 20), Shenshu (BL 23), Hegu (LI 4), Lieque (LU 7) and Taixi (KI 3) on the both sides. In the sham-TEAS group, at the same time points and same acupoints as the TEAS group, the electrode pads were attached to the acupoints, but without electric stimulation. The interventions were given 30 min each time, once daily in the two groups. The incidence of cough and the scores of visual analogue scale (VAS) for cough on the first day (T), the third day (T), the fifth day (T), 1 month (T) and 3 months (T) after operation, as well as the scores of the Leicester cough questionnaire (LCQ) on Tand Twere compared between the two groups; the contents of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) were detected before surgery (T) and at T, Tand T. The first flatus time, the first defecation time, the first ambulation time, the postoperative hospital day and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were compared between the two groups. Compared with the sham-TEAS group, the cough incidence at Tand cough VAS scores at Tto Twere lower in the TEAS group (<0.05,<0.01), and the LCQ scores at Tand Twere higher (<0.05). The serum contents of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1;at Tto Tin the TEAS group were lower than those of the sham-TEAS group (<0.01). The first flatus time, the first defecation time and the first ambulation time were earlier (<0.05,<0.01); and the postoperative hospital day was shorter (<0.05) and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was lower (<0.05) in the TEAS group when compared with those of the sham-TEAS group. TEAS relieves cough in lung cancer patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, improves quality of life and promotes the early postoperative recovery.
