Study Title: Low-Dose Alfentanil Inhibits Sufentanil-Induced Cough During Anesthesia Induction: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind Study.

Study Summary:
Cough is one of the most common complications following intravenous administration of sufentanil during anesthesia induction. The study aimed to investigate the protective effect of alfentanil, afentanyl derivative with short onset time and short duration, in reducing sufentanil-induced cough. Eighty patients that scheduled for thyroid surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into the alfentanil group and normal saline group, with 40 cases per group. Patients in the alfentanil group received intravenous administration of 2 &#x3bc;g/kg alfentanil prior to sufentanil injection during general anesthesia induction, while the same dose of normal saline was administered in the normal saline group. The outcomes measures included the incidence and severity of cough and common side effects of opioids following the administration of sufentanil during the induction of general anesthesia, intraoperative hemodynamics parameters and major adverse events during anesthesia recovery period. The incidence of cough within one minute after the injection of sufentanil during anesthesia induction was 40% in the normal saline group, and the pretreatment of alfentanil significantly reduced the incidence of sufentanil-induced cough to 5% (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, the patients in the alfentanil group had decreased severity of sufentanil-induced cough compared with the normal saline group (p < 0.05). No significant differences in the incidences of common side effects of opioids (dizziness, nausea and vomiting, chest tightness and respiratory depression) within one minute after sufentanil injection were found (p > 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two groups in intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, extubation time, or the incidences of emergence agitation, respiratory depression, delayed recovery from anesthesia and postoperative nausea and vomiting during Postanesthesia Care Unit stay (p > 0.05). Pretreatment with low-dose alfentanil (2 &#x3bc;g/kg) effectively and safely reduced both the incidence and severity of sufentanil-induced cough during anesthesia induction.
