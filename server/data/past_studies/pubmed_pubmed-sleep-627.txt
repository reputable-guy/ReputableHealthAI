Study Title: Sleep disorder risk, perceived control over sleep, and mental health symptoms in paramedicine students.

Study Summary:
Paramedics commonly experience both poor sleep and mental health symptoms. Clarifying whether sleep or mental health symptoms are a challenge prior to commencement of employment is important, as early prevention and intervention initiatives during training could support these workers. Paramedicine students (n=53) were included, with sleep disorder screening (obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia and restless legs syndrome), and mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms: Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and anxiety symptoms: General Anxiety Disorder-7). Data were analysed using robust regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and shift work status. Meeting criteria for a sleep disorder (n=21) was associated with higher scores for anxiety (8.2 [95% CI: 5.9-10.5] v 4.6, [3.4-5.8]) and depressive symptoms (11.1 [8.6-13.6] v 4.4 [3.1-5.7)] compared to those who did not meet the criteria for a sleep disorder (n=32). Depressive symptoms were lower in those with perceived control over sleep (5.2 [3.2-7.2] v 9.8 [7.7-11.8]). There was no interaction between sleep disorder risk and perceived control over sleep on mental health symptoms. Investigation and management of factors contributing to low perceived control over sleep, together with early screening and management of sleep disorders, are likely to be important priorities to support paramedic student wellbeing prior to commencing shift work.
