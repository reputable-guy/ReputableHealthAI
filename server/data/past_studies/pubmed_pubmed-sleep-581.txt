Study Title: Repeated electrical vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS) reduces severity in moderate to severe insomnia; a randomised, sham-controlled trial; the modius sleep study.

Study Summary:
Insomnia is a prevalent health concern in the general population associated with a range of adverse health effects. New, effective, safe and low-cost treatments, suitable for long-term use, are urgently required. Previous studies have shown the potential of electrical vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS) in improving insomnia symptoms, however only one sham-controlled trial has been conducted on people with chronic insomnia. Repeated VeNS delivered by the Modius Sleep device prior to sleep onset will show superior improvement in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores over a 4-week period compared to sham stimulation. In this double-blinded, multi-site, randomised, sham-controlled study, 147 participants with moderate to severe insomnia (ISI&#x2265;15) were recruited and allocated a VeNS or a sham device (1:1 ratio) which they were asked to use at home for 30&#xa0;min daily (minimum 5 days per week) for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, mean ISI score reduction was 2.26 greater in the VeNS treatment group than the sham group (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). In the per protocol analysis, the treatment group had a mean ISI score decrease of 5.8 (95&#xa0;% CI [-6.8, -4.81], approaching the clinically meaningful threshold of a 6-point reduction, with over half achieving a clinically significant decrease. Furthermore, the treatment group showed superior improvement to the sham group in the SF-36 (Quality of Life) energy/fatigue component (PP p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004, effect size 0.26; ITT p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006, effect size 0.22). Modius sleep has the potential to provide a viable, non-invasive and safe clinically meaningful alternative treatment option for insomnia.
