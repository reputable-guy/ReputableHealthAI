Study Title: A feasibility study of mindfulness-based interventions for children.

Study Summary:
Children's overall psychological well-being is a concern for parents and adults worldwide. Mindfulness appears to be a promising intervention for enhancing children's psychological well-being, and its effectiveness has been well-documented. However, there is a paucity of data on the feasibility and acceptability of implementing mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for children; this is a crucial factor in determining whether MBIs can be utilized to benefit children. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing MBIs among Hong Kong children. Seventy-eight children (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.06, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;.375) were recruited from a primary school in Hong Kong and received MBIs in a single session that lasted about 2&#xa0;h. The intervention's feasibility was determined in terms of retention rates, while acceptability was based on qualitative feedback from the children. The results show that there were high retention rates (96%). Qualitative analyses of children's feedback revealed that they experienced enhanced well-being, and enjoyed and benefited from the interventions. This study shows the high feasibility of MBIs in children, supporting the conduct of an efficacy trial to examine the effects of MBIs among children. Support from school teachers and measures to raise and maintain children's interest in mindfulness could facilitate the conduct of a study.
