Study Title: Effects of Footbath on Pain, Anxiety, Sleep, and Comfort Levels in Patients With Postlaparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Randomized Controlled Study.

Study Summary:
The aim of the study is to determine the effect of of hot footbaths on the pain, anxiety, sleep, and comfort levels of patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The study is a randomized controlled designed. This study was conducted in surgery clinic of a university hospital between January 2022 and November 2022. The research was completed with 54 patients in the experimental group and 54 patients in the control group. The mean state anxiety score and VAS-Sleep score of the patients in the experimental group 120 minutes after the application was 31.07&#xb1;4.70 and 612.62&#xb1;82.37, respectively, which was statistically significantly lower than that of the patients in the control group ( P <0.05). On the other hand, at the 120th minutes after the application, the mean VAS-Comfort scores of the patients in the experimental group were statistically significantly higher than those of the patients in the control group ( P <0.05). A positive relationship was found between the mean VAS-Pain and VAS-Sleep scores of the patients in the experimental group, and a significant negative relationship was found between the mean VAS-Comfort and state anxiety scores. Foot bath is effective in reducing the pain and anxiety levels of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery.
