Study Title: Effectiveness of a program to lower unwanted media screens among 2-5-year-old children: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Limited interventions exist on reducing unwanted screen time (ST) among children from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), so we developed and assessed the effectiveness of the program to lower unwanted media screen time (PLUMS) among children aged 2-5&#x2009;years in Chandigarh, Union Territory, North India. An open-label randomized control parallel group trial per CONSORT guidelines was conducted among randomly selected 340 families with children aged 2-5 (&#xb1;3&#x2009;months) years in Chandigarh, India. PLUMS was implemented at the family level with a focus on modifying the home media environment and targeted individual-level interventions using parent and child modules for 2&#x2009;months. A post-intervention (immediately) and a follow-up assessment after 6&#x2009;months was done. During the follow-up period, the interaction was done passively via WhatsApp groups. The control group received routine healthcare services. Validated and standardized tools, including a digital screen exposure questionnaire with a physical activity component, preschool child behavior checklist, and sleep disturbance scale for children, were used to collect data at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up periods. The primary outcome was the mean difference in ST (minutes/day) among children in the intervention group versus the control group. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis was performed to adjust for clustering. An equal number of families (&#x2009;=&#x2009;170) were randomly assigned to the intervention and control arms. In the post-intervention assessment, 161 and 166 families continued while, at the follow-up assessment, 154 and 147 were in the intervention and control arm, respectively. The mean difference in ST on a typical day [27.7&#x2009;min, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 5.1, 50.3] at the post-intervention assessment significantly (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) decreased in the intervention (102.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;98.5&#x2009;min) arm as compared with the control (130.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;112.8&#x2009;min) arm. A significant reduction in ST (&#x2009;=&#x2009;-35.81&#x2009;min, CI -70.6, -1.04) from baseline (&#x2009;=&#x2009;123.1&#x2009;min) to follow-up phase (&#x2009;=&#x2009;116&#x2009;min) was observed in GEE analysis. The duration of physical activity increased both at post-intervention (&#x2009;=&#x2009;48.4&#x2009;min, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;+6.6, +90.3) and follow-up (&#x2009;=&#x2009;73.4&#x2009;min, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;36.2, 110.5) assessments in the intervention arm. The PLUMS intervention significantly reduced the children's mean ST on a typical day and increased the physical activity immediately post-intervention and during the 6-month follow-up period. These results might guide the policymakers to include strategies in the national child health programs in the Southeast Asia Region to reduce unwanted ST.: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier CTRI/2017/09/009761.
