Study Title: The effect of mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) on the body image of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has increased in the last decade, resulting in enduring psychological effects, including negative body image. This study explored the effect of mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) on body image in women with PCOS. In a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial conducted in Kerman, Iran, women of reproductive age (18-45) who were diagnosed with PCOS and met specific inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to either the MBAT intervention group or a control group placed on a therapy waiting list. The main focus of the study involved evaluating alterations in body image scores as the primary measure. Additionally, the study assessed secondary outcomes, which encompassed various domains of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) before, immediately after, and one month after the intervention. The trial is registered with www.irct.ir (Registration code (25/01/2020): IRCT20170611034452N9). Between August 2020 and January 2021, 66 participants were randomly assigned to the MBAT or waiting list group, and the study was completed by 60 women. At the end of the intervention, body image (adjusted mean difference from baseline (AMD) of 29.22 [95% CI 19.54, 38.90], P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) and at the one-month follow-up (AMD of 34.77 [95% CI 24.75, 44.80], P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) were greater in the MBAT group than in the waiting list group. At certain time points, some MBSRQ domains, including body area satisfaction (BASS) (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), appearance evaluation (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), fitness orientation (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05), health orientation (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), and self-classified weight (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05), had higher scores than did the control group. However, only BASS had a conclusive effect size (large). Additionally, appearance orientation (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05), illness orientation (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05), health evaluation (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), fitness evaluation (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05), and overweight preoccupation (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05) had lower scores with variable and inconclusive effect sizes. The MBAT has potential as an effective approach for enhancing body image in women with PCOS. However, some MBSRQ domain results were inconclusive, likely due to the small sample size. Therefore, further research with a larger sample size is recommended.
