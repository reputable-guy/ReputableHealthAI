Study Title: Sleep, Nutrition, and Health Maintenance in Cardiothoracic Surgery.

Study Summary:
Cardiothoracic surgeons work in high-intensity environments starting in surgical training and throughout their careers. They deal with critical patients. Their routine procedures are delicate, require extensive attention to detail, and can have detrimental effects on patients' lives. Cardiothoracic surgeons are required to perform at their best capacity incessantly. To do this, they must safeguard their mental and physical well-being. Preserving health through sleep, nutrition, exercise, and routine medical checkups ensures a cardiothoracic surgeon's well-being. Great personal effort and discipline is required to maintain health in a busy schedule. We offer our best recommendations from expert peers in the field.
