Study Title: Enhancing physical function and activity level in malnourished older adults through oral nutrition supplements: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Malnutrition of older individuals, leads to significant functional decline, reducing their quality of life. Lifestyle interventions; dietary improvements and supplementation are explored to enhance the physical function of older adults. The current study aimed to assess the impact of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) on the functional and activity levels of Sri Lankan older adults. This randomized controlled trial included; an intervention group (IG) receiving 200 mL of ONS providing 247 kcal per serving, for 12 weeks and a control group (CG) receiving an equivalent volume of water. Changes in handgrip strength, knee extension strength, gait speed, functional and activity levels were assessed. The IG showed significant improvements in handgrip strength (43.96&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;18.61 kg vs. 32.81&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;17.92 kg; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) and knee extension strength (23.45&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.29 kg vs. 16.41&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.09 kg; p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) following 12 weeks compared to the CG. The IG also exhibited significant improvements in gait speed (1.31&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.52 m/s vs. 0.87&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.26 m/s), Barthel index score, (0.30&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.47 vs. -0.18&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.66), PASE score (0.52&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;17.79 vs. -1.60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;21.77) and IPAQ categories. ONS was found to be effective in improving the functional and physical activity levels of malnourished older adults. Sri Lanka Clinical Trial Registry SLCTR/2022/021. Registered on 06/10/2022.
