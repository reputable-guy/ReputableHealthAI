Study Title: Effects of cycling training on balance and gait in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A randomized controlled study.

Study Summary:
Although aerobic exercises such as cycling and swimming are increasingly being recommended in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), their effect on gait and balance parameters is unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of cycling training on balance and spatio-temporal gait parameters in children with DMD. Ambulant children (age range: 6.17-11.33 years) were randomly divided into two groups: home-based exercise training applied in the control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;12) while 12 weeks of supervised submaximal lower extremity cycling training in addition to home-based exercise training performed in the study group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;11). Gait and balance parameters were evaluated using the GAITRite electronic walkway system and the Bertec Balance Check Screener&#x2122;, respectively. Assessments were applied before and after 12 weeks of training. The mean ages of the children in the study and control groups were 8.20 (SD:1.34) and 8.86 (SD:1.30) years, consecutively (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). Considering the baseline values, the balance and spatio-temporal gait parameters of the children were similar except for the antero-posterior postural sway on the perturbed surface with eyes open (p&#xa0;>&#xa0;0.05). There was a significant time x group interaction effect in favor of the study group for the antero-posterior postural sway of children on the normal surface with eyes open (F (1,58)&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.62, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002). It was found that the antero-posterior postural sway on the normal surface with eyes open was improved in the study group within group comparison (F (1,10)&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.50, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.015). The study showed that both the cycling and the home-based exercise training groups may maintain gait and balance parameters during the study. Adding a cycling training to the rehabilitation program can also provide additional contribution to improve antero-posterior balance.
