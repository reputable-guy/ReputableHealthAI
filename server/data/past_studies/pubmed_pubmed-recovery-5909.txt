Study Title: Glucose ingestion does not lower testosterone concentrations in men on testosterone therapy.

Study Summary:
Oral calorie intake causes an acute and transient decline in serum testosterone concentrations. It is not known whether this decline occurs in men on testosterone therapy. In this study, we evaluated the change in testosterone concentrations following oral glucose ingestion in hypogonadal men before and after treatment with testosterone therapy. This is a secondary analysis of samples previously collected from a study of hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes who received testosterone therapy. Study participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14) ingested 75&#x2009;grams of oral glucose, and blood samples were collected over 2&#x2009;h. The test was repeated after 23&#x2009;weeks of intramuscular testosterone therapy. The mean age and body mass index of study volunteers were 53&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8&#x2009;years and 38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7&#x2009;kg/m, respectively. Following glucose intake, testosterone concentrations fell significantly prior to testosterone therapy (week 0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). The nadir of testosterone concentration was at 1&#x2009;h, followed by recovery to baseline by 2&#x2009;h. In contrast, there was no change in testosterone concentrations at week 23. The change in serum testosterone concentrations at 60&#x2009;min was significantly more at week 0 than week 23 (-11&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10% vs 0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;16%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). We conclude that oral glucose intake has no impact on testosterone concentrations in men on testosterone therapy. Endocrinology societies should consider clarifying in their recommendations that fasting testosterone concentrations are required for the diagnosis of hypogonadism, but not for monitoring testosterone therapy.
