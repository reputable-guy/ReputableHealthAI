Study Title: Investigating the effect of mindfulness counselling on sexual functioning of women with premenstrual syndrome.

Study Summary:
Mindfulness exercises can improve a wide range of the psychological and interpersonal consequences of premenstrual syndrome. Nevertheless, there is sparse information about the effect of mindfulness counselling on sexual dysfunction in women with this condition. This study aimed to determine the effect of mindfulness counselling on the sexual functioning of women with premenstrual syndrome. In this controlled randomized study, 112 women diagnosed with premenstrual syndrome referred to selected urban healthcare centers in Isfahan, Iran, were randomly allocated to two groups (intervention and control), each with 56 participants. The intervention group underwent mindfulness counselling in eight 60-minute sessions online via Google Meet. The control group did not receive any kind of intervention. The principal measure was score on the Rosen Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) before, immediately, and one month after the intervention. The data were analyzed by SPSS 23, through descriptive and analytical statistical tests (chi-square, Mann-Whitney, independent t-test, ANOVA, and repeated measure) with a significance level of 0.05. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean FSFI score (or the subscores) between the intervention and control groups (p&#xa0;greater than&#xa0;0.05) at baseline. In the intervention group, there were significant increases (relative to both baseline and in comparison with the control group) in the mean subscores for sexual desire (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001), orgasm (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01), satisfaction (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0001), sexual pain (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003), and general sexual functioning (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001) immediately after and one month after the intervention, but the score for sexual arousal was significantly greater only at the one-month evaluation (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.0001) and there were no differences in the scores for vaginal lubrication. On the other hand. Mindfulness counselling was effective in improving the sexual functioning of women suffering from premenstrual syndrome, and should be used for this purpose in healthcare centers.
