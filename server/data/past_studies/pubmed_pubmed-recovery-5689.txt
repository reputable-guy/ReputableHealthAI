Study Title: The Effect of Different Propofol-Ketamine Combinations on Emergence Delirium in Children Undergoing Adenoidectomy and Tonsillectomy Surgery.

Study Summary:
Emergence delirium (ED) after sevoflurane anesthesia remains a serious issue in children. We aimed to compare different ratios of propofol-ketamine combinations to determine a better option for preventing ED. A prospective, randomized clinical trial. In this study, 112 children aged between 3 and 12 years who underwent adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were recruited. Propofol 1&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kg+&#xa0;ketamine 1&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kg(1:1 ratio), propofol 1.5&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kg+&#xa0;ketamine 0.75&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kg(2:1 ratio), propofol 2&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kg+&#xa0;ketamine 0.66&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kg(3:1 ratio), and propofol 3&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kgwere applied at induction of anesthesia for Groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Fentanyl 1&#xa0;mcg&#xa0;kgand rocuronium 0.6&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kgwere applied at induction, and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and O/NO mixture for all participants. Intravenous morphine 0.1&#xa0;mg&#xa0;kgwas applied for postoperative analgesia in the last 10&#xa0;minutes of surgery. ED was defined as a Watcha score of &#x2265;3. Demographics, hemodynamics, extubation time, Watcha scores, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores, length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), rescue analgesic requirement, and postoperative complications were recorded. ED was significantly higher at 10 and 20&#xa0;minutes in Group IV. Eighteen children experienced ED in PACU, (3, 2, 2, and 11 children in Groups I, II, III, and&#xa0;IV, respectively). Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores were significantly different at all times. Rescue analgesics were required by 3 children (10.7%) in Group I, 2 (7.1%) in Group II, 2 (7.1%) in Group III, and 10&#xa0;(35.7%) in Group IV (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.012). The PACU stay was 21.9&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.4 in Group I, 18.7&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;6.3 in Group II, 16.7&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.8 in Group III, and 17.4&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.8 in Group IV. Nystagmus was observed in three children in Group I. To addition of ketamine to propofol during the induction of sevoflurane anesthesia can reduce the ED and analgesic requirements in children. A propofol-to-ketamine ratio of 3:1 provided better postoperative recovery with less pain and ED, without prolonging the PACU length of stay.
