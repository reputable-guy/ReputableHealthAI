Study Title: Enhanced recovery programs following adhesive small bowel obstruction surgery are feasible and reduce the rate of postoperative ileus: a preliminary study.

Study Summary:
The recovery of gastrointestinal function and postoperative ileus are the leading goals for clinicians following surgery for adhesive small bowel obstruction. While enhanced recovery programs may improve recovery, their feasibility in emergency surgery has not yet been proven. We sought to assess the incidence of postoperative ileus in patients following surgery for ASBO and the feasibility of enhanced recovery programs, including their benefits in the recovery of gastrointestinal functions and reducing the length of hospitalization. This prospective study includes the first 50 patients surgically treated for ASBO between June 2021 and November 2022. Their surgery was performed either as an emergency procedure or after a short course of medical treatment. The main aim was to compare the observed rate of postoperative ileus with a theoretical rate, set at 40%. The study protocol was registered in clinicaltrials.gov under the number NCT04929275. Among the 50 patients included in this study, it reported postoperative ileus in 16%, which is significantly lower than the hypothetical rate of 40% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0004). The median compliance with enhanced recovery programs was 75% (95%CI: 70.1-79.9). The lowest item observed was the TAP block (26%) and the highest observed items were preoperative counselling and compliance with analgesic protocols (100%). The overall morbidity was 26.5%, but severe morbidity (Dindo-Clavien&#x2009;>&#x2009;3) was observed in only 3 patients (6%). Severe morbidity was not related with the ERP. Enhanced recovery programs are feasible and safe in adhesive small bowel obstruction surgery patients and could improve the recovery of gastrointestinal functions. NCT04929275. WHAT DOES THE STUDY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIELD?: Perioperative management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) surgery needs to be improved in order to reduce morbidity. Enhanced recovery programs (ERP) are both feasible and safe following urgent surgery for ASBO. ERPs may improve the recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) functions.
