Study Title: Evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of nanodispersible cannabidiol oral solution (150&#x202f;mg/mL) versus placebo in mild to moderate anxiety subjects: A double blind multicenter randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Anxiety disorders, an increasingly prevalent global mental health illness, affected approximately 301 million individuals worldwide in 2019. There is an unmet need for the treatment of anxiety disorders, as current therapies are associated with limited response rates, residual symptoms, and adverse effects. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of nanodispersible cannabidiol (CBD) oral solution versus placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety disorders. This phase 3 prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 15-week cohort study took place at multiple sites across India. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms (CBD or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio. 178 participants were randomized to receive CBD (n=89) or placebo (n=89). The study met both primary (GAD-7 and HAM-A scores) and secondary outcomes (CGI-I, CGI-S, PHQ-9 and PSQI scores). The GAD-7 score difference between the end of treatment and baseline for the CBD versus the placebo was -7.02 (S.E: 0.25, 95% CI -7.52; -6.52), p<0.0001. Similarly, the HAM-A score difference at the end of treatment compared to baseline for the CBD versus the placebo was -11.9 (S.E: 0.33, 95% CI -12.6; -11.3), p<0.0001. Nanodispersible CBD was therapeutically safe with no serious adverse events, well tolerated, and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety disorders, as well as associated depression and sleep quality disturbances. These results pave way for probable prospective use of nanodispersible CBD formulation for various psychiatry disorders alone or in conjunction with other drugs.
