Study Title: Exploring the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention in university students: MindKinder adult version program (MK-A).

Study Summary:
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the mindfulness-based intervention MindKinder Adult version (MK-A) program on dispositional mindfulness, trait emotional intelligence, mental health, and emotional regulation difficulties in university students. A quasi-experimental design of repeated measures pretest-posttest with a control group was used. The sample consisted of 137 university students (67.9% women, with a mean age of 19.94 years). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;69) and the control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;68). Results showed that the program stimulated a significant improvement in dispositional mindfulness, describing, non-reactivity, trait emotional intelligence, mental health and emotional confusion in the experimental group. Given the obtained results, we consider the importance and incorporation of these mindfulness-based programs in university students. Due to the general characteristics of this population, having resources that lead to improvements, such as those obtained in this study, can be of great help since, in general, we find ourselves in a context, the university, in which students are subject to high levels of stress and anxiety. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed.
