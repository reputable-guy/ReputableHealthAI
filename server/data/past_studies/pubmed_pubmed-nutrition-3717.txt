Study Title: Three-Year School-Based Multicomponent Intervention May Change Fruit and Vegetable Preferences in Primary School Children-A Quasi-Randomized Trial.

Study Summary:
Preference could be the trigger for fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption in children and could be modified by appropriate intervention to increase the acceptance of FVs. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the three-year school-based multicomponent intervention "Nutri-&#x161;kolica" on the FV preferences of primary school children. It also aimed to explore whether a positive change in FV preferences could lead to an increase in actual FV consumption. The study was conducted in 14 primary schools from the city of Zagreb on 193 children (52.3% boys; age, 7.7 &#xb1; 0.4 years;= 85 in the control group and= 108 in the intervention group) who completed a preference questionnaire before and after the intervention with a 5-point hedonic smiley-face scale, where 5 means "I like it a lot." The per-protocol approach was used for data analysis (28.3% of children from the study sample). After the intervention, children in the intervention group (before: 3.1 &#xb1; 0.8; after: 3.5 &#xb1; 0.8) increased their FV preferences significantly more than children in the control group (before: 3.2 &#xb1; 0.8; after: 3.3 &#xb1; 0.7). Children's FV preferences changed most toward the varieties for which they had the least preferences at the beginning of the study. Participation in the intervention had a stronger effect on changing FV intake than change in FV preferences among primary school children. In summary, the present study highlighted that a targeted intervention can increase children's FV preferences, but that participation in the intervention is substantial for increasing FV intake.
