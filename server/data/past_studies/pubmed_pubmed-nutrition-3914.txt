Study Title: [Effects of three medical nutrition therapies for weight loss on metabolic parameters and androgen level in overweight/obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome].

Study Summary:
To investigate the effects of calorie-restricted diet (CRD), high protein diet (HPD), high protein, and high dietary fiber diet (HPD+HDF) on metabolic parameters and androgen level in overweight/obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS).Ninety overweight/obese patients with PCOS from Peking University First Hospital from October 2018 to February 2020 were given medical nutrition weight loss therapy for 8 weeks and were randomly divided into CRD group, HPD group, and HPD+HDF group, with 30 patients in each group. Body composition, insulin resistance, and androgen level were detected before and after weight loss, and the efficacy of three weight loss therapies was compared through variance analysis and Kruskal-Wallistest.Eight patients in CRD group quit because they could not strictly complete the follow-up, therefore at the end of weight loss, 22, 30, and 30 patients in CRD group, HPD group and HPD+HDF group, respectively, were included in the final analysis. The baseline ages of the three groups were (31&#xb1;2) years, (32&#xb1;5) years and (31&#xb1;5) years, respectively (=0.952). After weight loss, the relevant indicators in HPD group and HPD+HDF group decreased more than those in CRD group. The body weight of CRD group, HPD group and HPD+HDF group decreased by 4.20 (11.92, 1.80), 5.00 (5.10, 3.32) and 6.10 (8.10, 3.07) kg, respectively (=0.038); BMI of the three groups decreased by 0.80 (1.70, 0.40), 0.90 (1.23, 0.50) and 2.20 (3.30, 1.12) kg/m, respectively (=0.002); homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR) index decreased by 0.48(1.93, 0.05), 1.21(2.91, 0.18) and 1.22(1.75, 0.89), respectively (=0.196); and free androgen index(FAI) decreased by 0.23(0.67, -0.04), 0.41(0.64, 0.30) and 0.44(0.63, 0.24), respectively (0.357).The three medical nutrition therapies can effectively reduce the weight of overweight/obese patients with PCOS, and improve insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Compared with CRD group, HPD group, and HPD+HDF group have better fat-reducing effect, and can better preserve muscle and basal metabolic rate while losing weight.
