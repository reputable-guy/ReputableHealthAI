Study Title: Effects of a Comprehensive Dietary Intervention Program, Promoting Nutrition Literacy, Eating Behavior, Dietary Quality, and Gestational Weight Gain in Chinese Urban Women with Normal Body Mass Index during Pregnancy.

Study Summary:
In urban Chinese women with normal body weight during pregnancy, we implemented a comprehensive dietary intervention program aimed at enhancing nutrition literacy, dietary quality, and gestational weight gain. The methods included both online and offline health education on prenatal nutrition, weekly weight monitoring, family back education practices, and real-time dietary guidance. The intervention was delivered to randomly assigned control and intervention group participants from gestational week 12 to week 24. The intervention group (= 44; 100% complete data) showed significant differences (mean (SD)) compared to the control group (= 42; 95.5% complete data) in nutrition literacy (53.39 &#xb1; 6.60 vs. 43.55 &#xb1; 9.58,< 0.001), restrained eating (31.61 &#xb1; 7.28 vs. 28.79 &#xb1; 7.96,< 0.001), Diet Quality Distance (29.11 &#xb1; 8.52 vs. 40.71 &#xb1; 7.39,< 0.001), and weight gain within the first 12 weeks of intervention (4.97 &#xb1; 1.33 vs. 5.98 &#xb1; 2.78,= 0.029). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of gestational diabetes (2 (4.5%) vs. 4 (9.5%),= 0.629). Participants in the intervention group reported an overall satisfaction score of 4.70 &#xb1; 0.46 for the intervention strategy. These results emphasize the positive role of comprehensive dietary intervention in promoting a healthy diet during pregnancy.
