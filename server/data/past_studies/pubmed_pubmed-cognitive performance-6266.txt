Study Title: Effects of Different Acute Plyometric Training Intensities on Attention and Psychological States.

Study Summary:
The objective of this investigation was to explore in a sample of female students the effects of several acute plyometric training intensities (low, moderate, and high-55-65%, 70-80%, and 90-100% of maximal vertical jump performance, respectively) on cognition (attention) and psychological states (mood). Thirty-seven female students (mean age = 19.72 &#xb1; 0.73 years, mean body mass index = 19.51) participated in the current study. They were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: a high-intensity plyometric exercise (HIPE), a moderate-intensity plyometric exercise (MIPE), and a low-intensity plyometric exercise (LIPE). Before and immediately after each session for the three conditions, all participants underwent a cognitive performance test (d2 test) and filled in a battery of psychological questionnaires (the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), and the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS)). The data reported higher concentration performance and a lower number of errors in the MIPE when compared with HIPE (all,-value < 0.05) groups, whereas no significant difference was found between other conditions (-value > 0.05). The RPE value was higher in the HIPE (-value < 0.001) and MIPE (= 0.01) than in the LIPE, and in the HIPE than in the MIPE (= 0.001) conditions. Concerning the BRUMS scale, fatigue (= 0.005) was significantly different among the various conditions, being higher in HIPE with respect to MIPE and LIPE (all,-value < 0.05) conditions. In conclusion, moderate-intensity plyometric exercise can be considered the best activity to improve visual attention. Practitioners may practice moderate-intensity plyometric exercises to improve concentration performance. However, due to the limitations of the present study (lack of a control group and between-subjects study design), further research in the field is warranted.
