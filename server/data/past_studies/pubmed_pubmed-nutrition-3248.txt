Study Title: Comparative efficacy of peptide-based versus standard polymeric enteral nutrition in ICU patients at high nutritional risk: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Within intensive care units (ICU), the administration of peptide-based formulas (PBF) may confer nutritional advantages for critically ill patients identified with heightened nutritional risk. This investigation aimed to ascertain the efficacy of PBF in comparison to standard polymeric formulas (SPF) among this patient cohort. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted across three ICUs, encompassing 63 adult patients characterized by elevated modified Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (mNUTRIC) scores. Enrollment occurred promptly subsequent to ICU admission, with participants allocated to receive either PBF or SPF. Primary outcome was the duration to achieve caloric targets. Secondary outcomes involved the evaluation of mean daily gastric residual volume, mechanical ventilation period, infection rates within the ICU, length of hospitalization, mortality rates, nutritional status and inflammatory markers, specifically serum albumin and interleukin-6 levels. Patients in the PBF group reached their caloric targets more expeditiously compared to the SPF group (2.06&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.43&#xa0;days versus 2.39&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.79&#xa0;days; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). No significant differences were discernible between the groups regarding gastric residual volume, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, mortality, or infection rates. Both cohorts exhibited minimal adverse effects and were devoid of any instances of abdominal distension. While not reaching statistical significance, the observed trends in albumin and interleukin-6 levels suggest a potential advantage of PBF utilization. The implementation of PBF enabled swifter attainment of caloric goals in ICU patients at high nutritional risk without adversely impacting other clinical parameters. Given its favorable tolerance profile and potential immunomodulatory properties, PBF may be considered a valuable nutritional intervention in this setting.Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20220221006.
