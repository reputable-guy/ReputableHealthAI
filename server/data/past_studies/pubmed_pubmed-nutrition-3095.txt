Study Title: Safety and Efficacy of a Composite Lipid Emulsion with Fish Oil in Hospitalized Neonates and Infants Requiring Prolonged Parenteral Nutrition - A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
Intravenous lipids are critical to the care of extremely premature and other high-risk infants. This study evaluated safety and efficacy of parenteral nutrition (PN) with composite intravenous lipid emulsion (CO-ILE) with fish oil compared with pure soybean oil lipid emulsion (SOLE). Randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter study (NCT02579265) in neonates/infants anticipated to require &#x2265;28 d of PN due to gastrointestinal malformations or injury. Duration of the initial and extended treatment phase was 28 d and 84 d, respectively (for patients with PN indication after day 28). Eighty-three patients (mean postnatal age 11.4 d, 54 preterm) received CO-ILE and 78 patients received SOLE (mean postnatal age 8.3 d, 59 preterm). Thirty-three patients per group completed 28 d of treatment. Risk of having conjugated bilirubin values >2 mg/dL confirmed by a second sample 7 d after the first during the initial treatment phase (primary outcome) was 2.4% (2 of 83) with CO-ILE and 3.8% (3 of 78) with SOLE (risk ratio: 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.09, 3.76). Between days 29 and 84, the number of patients with confirmed conjugated bilirubin values >2 mg/dL did not increase in the CO-ILE group (n = 2) and increased in the SOLE group (n = 9). At the end of the initial treatment phase, conjugated bilirubin concentrations were 45.6% lower under CO-ILE than under SOLE (P = 0.006). There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of essential fatty acid deficiency in patients in the CO-ILE group. Median time to discharge alive was 56.7 d and 66.4 d with CO-ILE and SOLE, respectively (hazard ratio: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.68). CO-ILE was associated with a possible lower risk of cholestasis and significantly lower conjugated bilirubin concentration at the end of the initial treatment phase in high-risk neonates and infants as compared with patients treated with SOLE. In summary, these data indicate that CO-ILE can be considered safe and may be preferable over SOLE in high-risk neonates. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02579265.
