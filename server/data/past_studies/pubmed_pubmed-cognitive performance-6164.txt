Study Title: Concomitant dual-site tDCS and dark chocolate improve cognitive and endurance performance following cognitive effort under hypoxia: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Ten male cyclists were randomized into four experimental conditions in this randomized, cross-over, double-blind, and sham-controlled study to test the combined effect of acute dark chocolate (DC) ingestion and anodal concurrent dual-site transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) targeting M1 and left DLPFC on cognitive and whole-body endurance performance in hypoxia after performing a cognitive task. Two hours before the sessions, chocolate was consumed. After arriving at the lab, participants completed an incongruent Stroop task for 30 min in hypoxia (O&#x2009;=&#x2009;13%) to induce mental fatigue, followed by 20 min of tDCS (2 mA) in hypoxia. Then, in hypoxia, they performed a time-to-exhaustion task (TTE) while measuring physiological and psychophysiological responses. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline, after the Stroop task, and during and after TTE. TTE in 'DC&#x2009;+&#x2009;a-tDCS' was significantly longer than in 'white chocolate (WC)&#x2009;+&#x2009;a-tDCS' and WC&#x2009;+&#x2009;sham-tDCS'. The vastus medialis muscle electromyography amplitude was significantly higher in 'DC&#x2009;+&#x2009;a-tDCS' and 'DC&#x2009;+&#x2009;sham-tDCS' than in 'WC&#x2009;+&#x2009;sh-tDCS'. During and after the TTE, choice reaction time was significantly lower in 'DC&#x2009;+&#x2009;a-tDCS' compared to 'WC&#x2009;+&#x2009;sh-tDCS'. Other physiological or psychophysiological variables showed no significant differences. The concurrent use of acute DC consumption and dual-site&#xa0;a-tDCS might improve cognitive and endurance performance in hypoxia.
