Study Title: Investigating the Impact of Caregiver Adverse Childhood Experiences Screening and Pediatrician-Led Discussions on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in a Majority-Hispanic Pediatric Primary Care Clinic Setting.

Study Summary:
Evidence suggests that screening and provider-led discussions of parental adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may help identify at-risk families and be linked to positive health outcomes in caregivers and their children. However, the direct effect of ACEs screening and discussions on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has yet to be studied. To determine if screening or provider-led discussions of parental ACEs are associated with inadvertent worsening of PTSD symptoms 1 week after screening. Data was obtained as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of ACEs screening and provider-led discussions on child health care utilization outcomes. Baseline surveys were completed before scheduled infant well child checks (WCCs). Providers were randomized into the standard of care or intervention (discussion) conditions. Intervention providers were trained in delivering brief trauma-informed discussions about the impact of ACEs on parenting during WCCs. Caregivers in a pediatric primary care clinic serving predominantly Hispanic and low socioeconomically resourced families (N=179, 93% female, 87% Hispanic). The Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and ACEs screening were completed at baseline. PC-PTSD-5 was repeated 1-week after screening. Mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression analysis of PTSD scores from baseline to 1-week postscreening with the full sample showed no significant effect of time [odds ratio (OR)=1.21, P=0.68], group (OR=1.68, P=0.33), or their interaction (OR=0.48, P=0.21). Screening or brief discussion of ACEs with providers trained in trauma-informed care were not associated with worsening PTSD symptoms.
