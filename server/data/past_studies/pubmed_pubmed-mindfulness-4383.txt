Study Title: Online mindfulness training for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: a randomized controlled&#xa0;trial using a multi-method assessment approach.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic drastically accelerated the need for studies examining the effectiveness of programs to bolster psychological well-being, particularly for at-risk groups, such as older adults (OAs). Mindfulness Training (MT) has been suggested as a well-suited program for this purpose. The present study examined the impact of a 4-week online, trainer-led MT course tailored for OAs during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty-three OAs were randomly assigned to either Group A or Group B. Group A received the online MT course during the 4-week interval between the first (T1) and second (T2) testing sessions, while Group B received the same MT course during the interval between T2 and the third testing session (T3). The testing sessions included measures of mindfulness, emotional well-being, psychological health, and cognitive performance. In addition, a very brief survey was sent every week during the T1-T2 and T2-T3 intervals to assess weekly emotional well-being. The findings revealed that MT may improve some, albeit not all, aspects of mindfulness and well-being, while no significant results were noted for outcomes measuring psychological health and cognitive performance. These findings are discussed in the context of the evolving COVID-19 situation.
