Study Title: Cognitive Training to Reduce Memory Disturbance Associated With Postoperative Cognitive Impairment After Elective Noncardiac Surgery: An Experimental Study.

Study Summary:
Assess the efficiency of a cognitive training program using an artificial intelligence application to optimize cognitive reserve and reduce memory disturbance in patients aged 55 to 75 after Class II-III elective noncardiac surgery. Experimental with random assignment. The study was conducted on 80 patients undergoing surgery at the Teknon Medical Center Hospital in Barcelona, from April 2018 to June 2021. Both groups were evaluated with cognitive tests before surgery and 7 and 30 days after surgery. The experimental group was subjected to cognitive training for 10 days before surgery to improve their cognitive reserve. Significant differences were found between the study groups 30 days after surgery in the three screening tests (Mini-Cog, T@M, and MFE). The intervention group presented with fewer cognitive and memory alterations. Age and pre-existing comorbidities were not correlated with an impact on memory impairment or cognitive function. A cognitive training program based on artificial intelligence, prescribed and monitored by anesthesia nurses has a positive impact on increasing cognitive reserve and reducing memory disturbance in patients aged 55 to 75 undergoing Class II to III elective, noncardiac surgery. This intervention may serve as a prehabilitation strategy in patients with a risk of cognitive dysfunction evaluated by anesthesia nurses for the purpose of preserving their cognitive function and optimizing their recovery.
