Study Title: Assessment of exercise-induced dehydration in underhydrated athletes: Which method shows the most promise?

Study Summary:
Athletes are commonly exposed to exercise-induced dehydration. However, the best method to detect dehydration under this circumstance is not clear. This study aimed to analyze pre- and post-dehydration measurements of biomarkers, including saliva osmolality (SOsm), urine osmolality (UOsm), urine-specific gravity (USG), urine color (Ucolor), serum osmolality (SeOsm), serum arginine vasopressin (AVP), serum sodium (Na), and thirst sensation in underhydrated athletes, using the body mass loss (BML) as the reference method. In this clinical trial (NCT05380089), a total of 38 athletes (17 females) with a regular low water intake (<35&#xa0;mL/kg/day) were submitted to exercise-induced dehydration with a heat index of 29.8&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xb0;C and an individualized running intensity (80-90% of first ventilatory threshold). ROC curve analysis revealed significant discriminative abilities of SOsm, with AUC values of 0.76&#xa0;at 1.5% BML, 0.75&#xa0;at 1.75% BML, and 0.87&#xa0;at 2% BML, while Naand SeOsm showed the highest AUC of 0.87 and 0.91&#xa0;at 2% BML, respectively. SOsm showed high sensitivity at 1.5% of BML, while SeOsm and Nademonstrated high sensitivity at 2% of BML. This study highlights SOsm as a potential indicator of hydration status across different levels of BML. Additionally, Naand SeOsm emerged as accurate dehydration predictors at 1.75% and 2% of BML. Notably, the accuracy of urinary indices and thirst sensation for detecting hydration may be limited.
