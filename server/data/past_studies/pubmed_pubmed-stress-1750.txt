Study Title: Efficacy of a brief psychological intervention to reduce distress in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp increase in mental health problems among healthcare workers (HCWs). Accessible interventions for HCWs are needed to reduce distress during the pandemic. This study evaluated the efficacy of a brief psychological intervention (RECHARGE) delivered by videoconferencing to reduce psychological distress in HCWs. This single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial enrolled HCWs in Switzerland who screened positive for psychological distress. Participants were randomly allocated to RECHARGE, that taught behavioral strategies or active treatment as usual (ATAU). Primary outcome was the total score on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) measured at baseline, post-intervention, 2-month (primary outcome time point), and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included worry, anxiety and depression, burnout, traumatic stress, moral injury distress, and work performance. Between August 2020 and May 2021, 160 HCWs were enrolled in the study (RECHARGE = 82, ATAU = 78). Relative to ATAU, at 2 months RECHARGE led to a greater reduction in psychological distress (mean difference = 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI .28, .34], p = .02; effect size = .37), and greater reductions in worry, burnout, and moral injury distress. These effects were not maintained at 6 months. This trial provides initial evidence that a brief psychological intervention delivered via videoconferencing results in significant reductions in mental health problems arising during the COVID-19 pandemic. Booster sessions or digital tools may be needed to maintain the initial gains achieved by RECHARGE. This intervention may have utility in improving the mental health of HCWs both during pandemics and everyday stressors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).
