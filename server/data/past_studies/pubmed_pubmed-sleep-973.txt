Study Title: Effects ofStrain Shirota on Daytime Performance in Healthy Office Workers: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Crossover, Placebo-Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
strain Shirota (LcS) modulates psychological homeostasis via the gut-brain axis. To explore the possible efficacy of LcS for improving daytime performance, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study of 12 healthy office workers with sleep complaints. The participants received fermented milk containing viable LcS (daily intake of 1 &#xd7; 10colony-forming units) and non-fermented placebo milk, each for a 4-week period. In the last week of each period, the participants underwent assessments of their subjective mood and measurements of physiological state indicators via an electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate variability in the morning and afternoon. The attention score in the afternoon as assessed by the visual analog scale was higher in the LcS intake period than in the placebo intake period (= 0.041). Theta power on EEG measured at rest or during an auditory oddball task in the afternoon was significantly lower in the LcS period than in the placebo period (= 0.025 and 0.009, respectively). The change rate of theta power was associated with the change in attention score. Treatment-associated changes were also observed in heart rate and the sympathetic nerve activity index. These results indicate that LcS has possible efficacy for improving daytime performance, supported by observations of the related physiological state indicators.
