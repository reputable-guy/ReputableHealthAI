Study Title: Lack of Efficacy of Suvorexant in People with Insomnia and Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes.

Study Summary:
Sleep disturbance is a common and underappreciated feature of diabetes and sleep may contribute to glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted a 3-month trial to examine the efficacy of suvorexant in improving sleep and health outcomes in people with suboptimally controlled T2D and insomnia. This parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted using the sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD). Sixty-nine people with poorly controlled T2D (HbA1c &#x2265; 6.5) were randomized to placebo and/or suvorexant (10-20 mg). The primary outcome was subjective total sleep time (sTST), and secondary outcomes were Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and wake time after sleep onset (WASO). Exploratory outcomes included sleep efficiency, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Exploratory analyses were conducted on relationships between sleep and diabetes outcomes. There were no significant improvements in sTST (= 0.27), ISI (= 0.86), or WASO (= 0.94) among participants taking suvorexant compared to placebo. There were also no significant changes in any of the exploratory endpoints. Improvements in sleep were associated with improvements in both objective (ie, HbA1c) and subjective (ie, Diabetes Distress Scale) measures of diabetes, as well as reductions in depressive symptoms, independent of treatment assignment. The study did not find evidence that suvorexant is efficacious for insomnia in people with poorly controlled T2D. The associations of improved sleep with improvements in both diabetes-related metrics and depressive symptoms across groups highlight the importance of identifying and treating sleeping difficulties in this population.
