Study Title: Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the 24-hour movement behaviours, including muscle and bone strengthening activity, with bone and lean mass from childhood to adolescence.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to assess whether moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sport and exercise as a proxy measure of muscle and bone strengthening activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep were associated with total-body-less-head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and TBLH lean mass cross-sectionally and longitudinally from age 6 to 9 years and age 9 to 11 years to age 15 to 17 years. We used longitudinal data from a population sample of Finnish children from the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study (age 6 to 9 years: n = 478, 229 females; age 9 to 11 years: n = 384, 197 females; age 15 to 17 years: n = 222, 103 females). Linear regression analysed the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between accelerometer-assessed MVPA, sedentary time and sleep, and questionnaire-assessed sport and exercise participation and screen time with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-assessed TBLH BMC and lean mass. In females, MVPA at age 6 to 9 years was positively associated with TBLH BMC at age 15 to 17 years (&#x3b2; = 0.008, p = 0.010). Sport and exercise at age 9 to 11 years was positively associated with TBLH BMC (&#x3b2; = 0.020, p = 0.002) and lean mass (&#x3b2; = 0.343, p = 0.040) at age 15 to 17 years. MVPA at age 9 to 11 years was positively associated with TBLH lean mass (&#x3b2; = 0.272, p = 0.004) at age 15 to 17 years. In males, sleep at age 6 to 9 years was positively associated with TBLH lean mass (&#x3b2; = 0.382, p = 0.003) at age 15 to 17 years. Sport and exercise at age 9 to 11 years was positively associated with TBLH BMC (&#x3b2; = 0.027, p = 0.012) and lean mass (&#x3b2; = 0.721, p < 0.001) at age 15 to 17 years. Promoting engagement in the 24-hour movement behaviours in childhood, particularly sport and exercise to strengthen muscle and bone, is important in supporting bone and lean mass development in adolescence.
