Study Title: The Feasibility of a Mindfulness Intervention for Depression in People with Mild Dementia: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
This preliminary study aimed to establish the feasibility of running an adapted Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention for people with mild dementia and depression. It also aimed to conduct an exploratory analysis as to whether the MBCT intervention would lead to greater improvements in measures of depression, anxiety, quality of life and cognition, as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). A single-blind, multisite, feasibility randomized controlled trial was used. People with dementia and depression were recruited from participating memory services. Twenty participants were randomized to either an adapted MBCT and TAU group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) or TAU (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10). Measures of depression, anxiety, quality of life (QOL), and cognition were assessed at baseline and follow-up. The intervention was feasible in terms of high attendance and low levels of attrition. It was not judged feasible to recruit enough participants within the recruitment time-frame. The MBCT group did not show significant improvements in depression, anxiety, QOL, and cognition at follow-up, as compared to TAU. There is currently inadequate evidence to recommend this adapted MBCT intervention for people with dementia for the treatment of depression within memory services. The MBCT intervention needs redevelopment and piloting before further testing in an RCT.
