Study Title: Community-based intervention for obstructive sleep apnea in the general population: a randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To investigate the engagement and health outcomes of community-based intervention for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the general population. We conducted a 3-month randomized controlled trial in two communities in southern China. We initially screened the general population for high-risk OSA and further diagnosis using home sleep testing. Eligible participants were randomly (1:1) assigned to either a control or continuous positive airway pressure-based integrated intervention group. The primary outcomes were multimodal indicators reflecting health outcomes, including health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 [SF-36]), sleep-related symptoms, and cardiometabolic risk. Of the 2484 participants screened, 1423 identified as having high-risk OSA were considered for telephone invitations to participate in the trial. Of these, 401 participants responded positively (28.2%), 279 were diagnosed with OSA, and 212 were randomized. The intervention significantly improved several domains of SF-36, including physical functioning (intergroup difference, 2.8; p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.003), vitality (2.3; p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.031), and reported health transition (6.8; p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.005). Sleep-related symptoms, including Epworth Sleepiness Scale (-0.7; p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.017), Fatigue Severity Scale (-3.0; p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.022), Insomnia Severity Index (-1.8; p&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (-0.7; p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.032), also showed significant improvements. Although the intervention did not significantly alter glycolipid metabolism, ventricular function, or cardiac structural remodeling, it achieved a significant reduction in systolic (-4.5 mmHg; p&#x2005;=&#x2005;.004) and diastolic blood pressure (BP; -3.7 mmHg; p&#x2005;<&#x2005;.001). Community-based intervention for previously undiagnosed OSA in the general population yielded improvements in health-related quality of life, sleep-related symptoms, and BP. However, engagement in the intervention program was low.
