Study Title: Yellow pea-based pasta's impacts on the salt intake, glycemic parameters and oxidative stress in healthy individuals: a randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Pea (Pisum sativum L.), a widely cultivated legumes globally, is attracting interest as a functional food owing to its antioxidant properties derived from nutritional components such as polyphenols. We previously reported that yellow pea-based pasta (YPP) aids in controlling blood glucose and enhances the sensitivity to saltiness. This study examined the antioxidant effect of YPP and its effects on the salt intake and postprandial blood glucose levels by simulating a real-life scenario. In this open, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, 40 healthy adult men and women aged 20-65&#xa0;years, whose salt intake exceeded the target salt equivalent level of the Japanese dietary intake standard, were allocated to the following groups (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20): the group consuming one serving of YPP per day and the group maintaining their regular daily dietary habits. The participants who were allocated to the YPP group showed significantly improved oxidative stress markers (BAP/d-ROMs ratio change: control&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.11, YPP&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044; lipid peroxide change: control&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.11, YPP&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.25, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) than control participants. The effects on salt intake and blood glucose levels were limited. In conclusion, YPP may serve as a functional staple food that improves oxidative stress.
