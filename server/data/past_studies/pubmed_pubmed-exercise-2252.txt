Study Title: The impact of exercise intensity and duration for swim training-induced adaptations in cardiac structure and function in women with mild hypertension.

Study Summary:
This study aimed to investigate the impact of swim training intensity and duration on cardiac structure and function in mildly hypertensive women. Sixty-two mildly hypertensive women were randomized to 15&#x2009;weeks of either (1) high-intensity swimming (HIS, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21), (2) moderate-intensity swimming (MOD, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) or (3) control (CON, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). Training sessions occurred three times per week. Cardiac measurements were conducted using echocardiography pre- and post-intervention. Both the HIS and MOD groups demonstrated significant within-group increases in left ventricular mass: 7.3% [1.2; 13.2] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) for HIS and 6.2% [0.5; 11.8] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) for MOD. The MOD group also demonstrated a significant increase in left ventricular internal dimension at end-diastole by 2.4% [0.2; 4.6] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03).&#xa0;Post-hoc analysis of diastolic function markers revealed reduced mitral valve A velocity in both HIS (-14% [-25; -3], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and MOD&#x2009;(-13% [-23; -3], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), leading to increased mitral valve E/A ratios of 27% [10; 47] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) and 22% [5; 40] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), respectively. Additionally, only MOD demonstrated increased left atrial diameter of 4.9% [0.7; 9.1] (p&#x2009;=0.02). A significant time&#xd7;group effect (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) existed for global longitudinal strain, which increased by 1.6% [0.2; 3.0] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) in MOD only. In conclusion, swim training for 15&#x2009;weeks increased left ventricular mass and improved markers of diastolic function in mildly hypertensive women. These independent of exercise intensity and duration in mildly hypertensive women.
