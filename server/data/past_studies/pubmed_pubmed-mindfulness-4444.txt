Study Title: Incorporation of yoga in pharmacy education.

Study Summary:
The well-being of pharmacists is critical to support personal and professional health. Identifying and integrating a variety of practices that promote wellness is prudent for schools/colleges of pharmacy so students may form habits before entering the profession as practitioners. Yoga, a practice that combines muscular activity with mindfulness, can be incorporated with minimal resources via numerous mechanisms within and outside of the curriculum. The objective was to provide a summary of various strategies incorporating yoga in pharmacy professional curricula as well as detail various approaches to integrating yoga into pharmacy curricula. Literature was evaluated across professional pharmacy programs pertaining to yoga knowledge, beliefs, approaches, and benefits. Ten articles about yoga awareness, knowledge, beliefs, and benefits in professional pharmacy curricula were identified. Improvement in mental health and decreased stress were recognized as benefits. Within schools/colleges of pharmacy, yoga programming has been included in required as well as elective courses, co-curriculum programming, extracurricular activities, and post-graduate training. Schools of pharmacy can consider incorporation of yoga practice into curricula as a tool to promote well-being and resiliency.
