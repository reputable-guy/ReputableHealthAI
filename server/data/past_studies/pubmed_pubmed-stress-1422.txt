Study Title: Efficacy of Lingzhi or Reishi Medicinal Mushroom Ganoderma lucidum (Agaricomycetes) Supplementation on Psychological Stress and Selective Fitness Profile Parameters in Female College Students in West Bengal, India.

Study Summary:
Psychological disparities impact physical activity and fitness in sedentary female college students by affecting cardiovascular efficiency. Ganoderma lucidum, vitality-enhancing herb alleviates health and rejuvenates the mind-body to improve endurance fitness. A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel design study was conducted to determine whether supplementation of G. lucidum in daily dosages of 500 mg (GL500mg group) and 1000 mg (GL1000mg group) improves psychophysiological health capabilities during the different phases of the experimental trial. Analysis for pre-experimental trial (day 0), experimental trial (day 15), and post-experimental trial (after day 30) on anthropometric, psychological, physiological, and physical fitness parameters were executed. Seventy-eight participants (n = 78, age 20.64 &#xb1; 3.21 years) were assigned randomly and equally divided (n = 26) to one of the three treatment groups for intragroup and intergroup comparisons. Significant differences in the post-experimental GL1000mg group for heart rate (HR), maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), physical work capacity (PWC170), and right-hand grip strength (P < 0.05) compared with the placebo group were observed. GL1000mg-supplemented group also significantly improved (P < 0.05) HR, VO2max and PWC170 (P < 0.001) after pre- to post-trials. Experimental trial between placebo and GL1000mg group and post-experimental trial between the GL500mg and GL1000mg group showed significant changes in VO2max(P < 0.001) and PWC170 (P < 0.05). Anxiety, depression, vitality and positive well-being scores significantly improved, leading to improved psychological well-being after GL1000mg supplementation. GL1000mg supplementation for 30 days might act as a longevity-promoting tonic for endurance and strength performance by ameliorating stress to improve the overall psychophysiological health, vitality and quality of life for better cardiovascular efficacy.
