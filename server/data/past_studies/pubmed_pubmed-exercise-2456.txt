Calaway, C, Walls, K, Levitt, H, Caplan, J, Mann, B, Martinez, K, Gastaldo, R, Haq, I, and Signorile, JF. Velocity-based-training frequency impacts changes in muscle morphology, neuromuscular performance, and functional capability in persons with Parkinson's disease. J Strength Cond Res 39(1): 99-106, 2025-Velocity-based training (VBT) positively impacts muscle morphology and performance in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, optimal training frequencies for VBT in patients with PD remain undetermined. Changes in ultrasound-determined muscle thickness (MT) and echo intensity (EI)-derived muscle quality of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL), neuromuscular performance, and functional capacity were examined following 2 VBT frequencies (2-3 d&#xb7;wk -1 ) using 30% velocity loss thresholds for 12 weeks. Neuromuscular performance was assessed using computerized pneumatic resistance machines. For each variable, 2 (time) &#xd7; 2 (group) repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine significant main effects and interactions. Significant time effects were seen for MT and EI of all muscles ( p < 0.05). Muscle thickness improvements included right VL (RVL) (0.171 &#xb1; 0.065 cm; p = 0.019), left VL (LVL) (0.214 &#xb1; 0.101 cm; p = 0.049), right RF (RRF) (0.194 &#xb1; 0.077 cm; p = 0.023), and left RF (LRF) (0.318 &#xb1; 0.109 cm; p = 0.010). For EI, improvements occurred in RVL (-18.688 &#xb1; 3.600; p = <0.001), LVL (-10.959 &#xb1; 4.894; p = 0.040), RRF (-9.516 &#xb1; 3.537; p = 0.016), and LRF (-9.018 &#xb1; 3.444; p = 0.019). Time effects were seen for leg-press 1-repetition maximum and peak power ( p < 0.01) and habitual walking speed ( p = 0.022), with a group by time interaction for maximal gait speed favoring the 3 d&#xb7;wk -1 condition (&#x2206;0.15 m&#xb7;s -1 , p = 0.002). The results indicate that VBT at 2 or 3 d&#xb7;wk -1 can significantly improve muscle morphology, neuromuscular performance, and functional capability in patients with PD; however, improvements in maximal gait speed require 3 d&#xb7;wk -1 . These findings provide flexibility when developing exercise prescriptions for patients with PD.
