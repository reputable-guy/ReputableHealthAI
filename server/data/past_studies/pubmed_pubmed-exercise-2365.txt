Study Title: Effects of sildenafil on gas exchange, ventilatory, and sensory responses to exercise in subjects with mild-to-moderate COPD: A randomized cross-over trial.

Study Summary:
Excess exercise ventilation (high ventilation (V&#x307;)/carbon dioxide output (V&#x307;CO)) contributes significantly to dyspnea and exercise intolerance since the earlier stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A selective pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled nitric oxide) has shown to increase exercise tolerance secondary to lower V&#x307;/V&#x307;COand dyspnea in this patient population. We aimed to assess whether a clinically more practical option - oral sildenafil - would be associated with similar beneficial effects. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, twenty-four patients with mild-to-moderate COPD completed, on different days, two incremental cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) one hour after sildenafil or placebo. Eleven healthy participants performed a CPET in a non-interventional visit for comparative purposes with patients when receiving placebo. Patients (FEV= 69.4 &#xb1; 13.5&#x202f;% predicted) showed higher ventilatory demands (V&#x307;/V&#x307;CO), worse pulmonary gas exchange, and higher dyspnea during exercise compared to controls (FEV= 98.3 &#xb1;11.6&#x202f;% predicted). Contrary to our expectations, however, sildenafil (50&#x202f;mg; N= 15) did not change exertional V&#x307;/V&#x307;CO, dead space/tidal volume ratio, operating lung volumes, dyspnea, or exercise tolerance compared to placebo (P>0.05). Due to the lack of significant beneficial effects, nine additional patients were trialed with a higher dose (100&#x202f;mg). Similarly, active intervention was not associated with positive physiological or sensory effects. In conclusion, acute oral sildenafil (50 or 100&#x202f;mg) failed to improve gas exchange efficiency or excess exercise ventilation in patients with predominantly moderate COPD. The current study does not endorse a therapeutic role for sildenafil to mitigate exertional dyspnea in this specific patient subpopulation.
