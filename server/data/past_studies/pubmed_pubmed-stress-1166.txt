Study Title: Evaluating a novel clinical reasoning tool for physical therapy students: A pilot study.

Study Summary:
This paper explores the use of the Anticipate-Plan-Pause Clinical Reasoning (APP CR) Tool to enhance clinical reasoning (CR) in Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students. Current pedagogical methods often inadequately integrate CR abilities in a manner that is both engaging and effective. Drawing on several theoretical frameworks, the APP CR Tool was integrated into an interactive module for DPT students, aiming to improve CR abilities while reducing cognitive load and stress during high-stakes simulations. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with nine DPT students, divided into a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) and an intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4). Both groups used an interactive module with case-based scenarios, but only the intervention group used the APP CR Tool. Improvements in CR abilities and reduced stress and cognitive load were observed in both groups. However, statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between the groups. Despite this, a trend toward greater improvements in CR abilities was noted in the intervention group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.084). Further research is needed to validate these findings and refine the tool. The APP CR Tool shows potential for enhancing CR in DPT students, although its current application may require refinement to achieve statistically significant results. Educators should consider iterative improvements to the tool and its curriculum integration to better support CR development.
