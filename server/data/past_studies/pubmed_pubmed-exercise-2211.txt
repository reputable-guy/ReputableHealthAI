Study Title: Is strength and power training targeting hip and knee muscles superior to strength training in individuals with patellofemoral pain? Proof of concept study.

Study Summary:
The purpose was to determine whether the benefits of a muscle strength and power training program are superior to those achieved with muscle strength training alone in people with patellofemoral pain (PFP). Thirty-seven individuals with PFP (25.86&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.62 years) were randomly assigned to a strength and power training group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) or strength training group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19). Primary outcomes were pain intensity and physical functioning. Secondary outcomes were kinesiophobia, quality of life, maximal isometric torque and rate of torque development of the hip and knee and self-perception of recovery. Primary outcomes were measured at baseline, after six weeks, after 12 weeks and at three, six- and 12-months follow-ups. Secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. The significance level was 0.05. After interventions, no significant differences were found between groups for primary or secondary outcomes. No difference between groups were found for pain or physical functioning at the other assessment times. Results of this study indicated that addition of power exercises to strength training for hip and knee muscles did not result in superior benefits compared to strength training alone.
