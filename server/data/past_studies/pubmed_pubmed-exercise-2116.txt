Study Title: Caffeine Enhances Some Aspects of Physical Performance in Well-Trained Hammer and Discus Throwers.

Study Summary:
Caffeine is a widely recognized ergogenic aid for enhancing exercise performance. However, its effect on throwing performance has been less studied, yielding contradictory results. The main aim of the study was to analyze the potential ergogenic effects of a moderate dose of caffeine (3 mg&#xb7;kgbody mass) on vertical jump performance and throwing distance during a simulated competition in trained discus and hammer throwers. In a randomized, counterbalanced, and repeated measures design, 14 well-trained throwers (9 hammer throwers and 5 discus throwers; age 24.8 &#xb1; 6.3 years old, training 14.9 &#xb1; 5.0 h per week, competing experience 10.5 &#xb1; 6.1 years) performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) test, a modified throw, and a complete throw after the ingestion of 3 mg&#xb7;kg&#x207b;&#xb9; body mass of caffeine or a placebo. Each participant performed three maximal-effort valid modified throws of his/her respective event (i.e., hammer or discus throw), plus three maximal-effort valid official throws (up to five tries, respectively, in case any attempt was called as foul). Throwing distance was measured according to World Athletics regulations using a metal tape, while release speed was assessed with a radar device. After the performance measurements, participants completed a form about side effects prevalence. Caffeine, compared to placebo, increased throw distance (3.0 &#xb1; 5.1%,= 0.048) and speed release (5.7 &#xb1; 8.7%,= 0.03) for the complete throw, and distance (3.6 &#xb1; 4.4%,= 0.01) and speed release (4.8 &#xb1; 7.4 %,= 0.01) for the modified throw. Caffeine ingestion did not significantly improve jump height (1.1 &#xb1; 4.3%,= 0.28), although it improved force and power on braking and the propulsive phases of the CMJ (< 0.05). Caffeine only increased the prevalence of activeness (< 0.05). An acute moderate dose of caffeine enhanced hammer and discus throw performance in well-trained throwers during a simulated competitive setting, with minimal adverse side effects.
