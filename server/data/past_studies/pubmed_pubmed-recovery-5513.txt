Study Title: 'Just because I have prostate cancer doesn't mean that I can't do things' - men's experiences of the acceptability of an exercise intervention for prostate cancer during treatment.

Study Summary:
Structured exercise has an important role in mitigating the extensive side effects caused by ongoing prostate cancer treatments, specifically androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiation therapy (RT). Little is known about men's experiences of, and preferences for, structured exercise programmes during active cancer treatment. This study aimed to inform the acceptability of a 6-month supervised intervention that emphasised increasing and varied intensities of aerobic and resistance exercise, by exploring the experiences of men who participated. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with an interviewer independent of the exercise study and data was analysed using a descriptive qualitative design. Twelve prostate cancer patients were interviewed including participants who completed (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9) and withdrew from (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3) the intervention. Four main themes captured how men experienced the intervention: (1) Navigating the Unknown: Building confidence amidst vulnerability (subtheme- pushing the limits), (2) Building Trust: The credibility and approach of the exercise instructor (subtheme- appropriateness of supervised vs. independent exercise), (3) Flexibility in Delivery, (4) Finding Purpose: Exercise as a means of escapism and regaining control during treatment. While an initial lack of self-confidence can be a barrier to exercise participation, exercise programmes have the potential to provide psychosocial benefits, rebuild confidence and empower men throughout their cancer treatment and into recovery. Structured exercise is acceptable during treatment including RT and can offer a form of escapism and sense of control for men navigating their cancer journey. Trust building, flexible delivery and credibility alongside a challenging exercise prescription are important facilitators of acceptability for men. Strategies to embed exercise from the point of diagnosis through ADT and RT should reflect men's experiences of exercise during treatment. The trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as of the 14th of December 2021 (NCT05156424).
