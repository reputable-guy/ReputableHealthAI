Study Title: Tramadol-paracetamol for postoperative pain after spine surgery - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Study Summary:
Multimodal pain management is one component in enhanced recovery after surgery protocol. Here we evaluate the efficacy of tramadol-paracetamol in acute postoperative pain and pain outcome at 12 months after spine surgery in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomized 120 patients undergoing spine surgery to receive, for add-on pain management, two tramadol-paracetamol 37.5&#x2009;mg/325&#x2009;mg (= 61) or placebo tablets (= 59) twice a day for 5 postoperative days. In the hospital, multimodal pain management consisted of dexketoprofen and oxycodone. After discharge, patients were prescribed ibuprofen 200&#x2009;mg, maximum 1,200&#x2009;mg/day. Pain, analgesic use, and satisfaction with pain medication were followed up with the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire before surgery and at 1 and 52 weeks after surgery. The primary outcome was patients' satisfaction with pain medication 1 week after surgery. At 1 week after surgery, patients' satisfaction with pain medication was similarly high in the two groups, 75% [interquartile range, 30%] in the placebo group and 70% [40%] in the tramadol-paracetamol group (= 0.949) on a scale: 0% =&#x2009; not satisfied, 100% = totally satisfied. At 1 week, ibuprofen dose was lower in the placebo group 200&#x2009;mg [1,000] compared to the tramadol-paracetamol group, 800&#x2009;mg [1,600] (= 0.016). There was no difference in the need for rescue oxycodone. Patients in the tramadol-paracetamol group had more adverse events associated with analgesics during the first postoperative week (relative risk = 1.8, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.6). Add-on pain treatment with tramadol-paracetamol did not enhance patients' satisfaction with early pain management after back surgery.
