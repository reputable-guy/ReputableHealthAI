Study Title: Dexmedetomidine <em>versus</em> Ketofol for Moderate Sedation in Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography.

Study Summary:
To compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine versus ketofol for moderate sedation in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Randomised controlled trial. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Anaesthesia, SICU and Pain Management, Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation, Karachi, Paksitan, from December 2021 to June 2022. Sixty-two patients aged 20-60 years of any gender scheduled for elective ERCP were included. Patients were randomly divided into Dexmedetomidine group (2ml ampule of 100ug/ml diluted in 18ml of normal saline) and Ketofol group (2ml ketamine and 10ml of propofol 1% diluted in 8ml of normal saline) for sedation. The mean difference in time to achieve Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) score of 4 and Modified Aldrete's Score (MAS) of 9 were noted as outcomes in each group. In addition, complications during the procedure and recovery were also noted. The mean age was 39.15 &#xb1; 9.82 years. There were 33 (53.2%) males and 29 (46.8%) females. The mean time to achieve RSS 4 was significantly lower in patients who were treated with Dexmedetomidine as compared to Ketofol, i.e., 11.84 &#xb1; 1.77 minutes vs. 13.10 &#xb1; 1.64 minutes respectively (p-value 0.005, 95% CI -2.12 to -0.39). Similarly, the mean time to achieve MAS score 9 was significantly lower in patients who were treated with Dexmedetomidine as compared to Ketofol, i.e., 11.19 &#xb1; 1.72 minutes vs. 12.23 &#xb1; 1.84 minutes, respectively (p-value 0.026, 95% CI -1.94 to -0.13). Dexmedetomidine proved to be more effective than Ketofol for sedation in ERCP, achieving faster sedation and quicker recovery.
