Study Title: Development and feasibility testing of a time-restricted eating intervention for women living with overweight/obesity and HIV in a resource-limited setting of South Africa.

Study Summary:
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are amongst the leading causes of death in South Africa. The preferred first-line&#xa0;anti-retroviral treatment contains&#xa0;dolutegravir (DTG), shown to increase body weight, may compound the already high rates of obesity and associated risk for T2D. South Africa has widespread food insecurity, making traditional dietary strategies difficult to implement. Time-restricted eating (TRE) may be an appropriate intervention in resource-limited communities. This article outlines the development and feasibility testing of a TRE intervention to inform the design of a TRE randomised controlled trial in women (20-45&#xa0;years old) living with overweight/obesity and HIV, receiving DTG-based treatment from a resource-limited community in Cape Town, South Africa. Factors influencing TRE adoption were identified using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour model and the Theoretical Domains Framework, combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions. Participants from the IDIs went on to participate in a single arm 4-week TRE pilot trial where feasibility was explored in terms of reach, acceptability, applicability, and implementation integrity. An iterative, thematic analysis approach was employed to analyse the qualitative data. Participants included 33 isiXhosa-speaking women (mean age 37.1&#xa0;years, mean BMI 35.9&#xa0;kg/m). Thematic analysis identified psychological capability (knowledge of fasting), social influences (cultural preferences, family support), and reflective motivation (awareness of weight, health impact, motivation for TRE) as key factors influencing adoption of TRE for weight management. In a 4-week TRE pilot trial (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12), retention was 100%. Positive outcomes perceived included improved energy, appetite control and weight loss. TRE was perceived as acceptable, easy, and enjoyable. Family support facilitated adherence, while habitual and social eating and drinking practices were barriers. Compliance was high, aided by self-selected eating times, reminders, and weekly calls. Recommendations included the incorporation of dietary education sessions and text messages to provide additional support and reminders. This study indicates that TRE is a feasible weight management strategy in women living with overweight/obesity and HIV, receiving DTG-based treatment in a resource-limited community. These findings will ensure that the forthcoming TRE randomised controlled trial is adapted and optimised to the local South African context.
