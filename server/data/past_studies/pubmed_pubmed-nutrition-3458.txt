Study Title: Clinical Effect of Tumor-Specific Total Nutrients in Patients with Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Radical Gastric Cancer Resection: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
In this study, we combined adjuvant chemotherapy after radical gastric cancer resection with tumor-specific total nutrient therapy to analyze how it affects the nutritional state and immune function of the patient. We collected data from 106 patients having undergone adjuvant chemotherapy after radical gastric cancer resection between January 2020 and December 2021. We divided the patients into experimental and control groups (with 53 cases in each group) through single-blinded simple randomization using a random number table and the sealed envelope system. The control group received chemotherapy and the regular nutritional diet at the same time while the experimental group received tumor-specific total nutrients based on the control group. We analyzed the index results for the physical examination, nutritional status, and immune function of the patients in both groups recorded before and after one chemotherapeutic cycle. The control and experimental group compositions were as follows: 58.5% and 52.8% males with a mean age &#xb1; standard deviation of 54.36 &#xb1; 12.68 and 55.15 &#xb1; 12.32 years, respectively. After one chemotherapeutic cycle and the nutritional intervention, the experimental group displayed better physical examination indicators than the control group concerning the weight (55.8 &#xb1; 5.41 vs. 54.8 &#xb1; 6.94, p = 0.621), body fat mass (13.3 &#xb1; 0.88 vs. 13.1 &#xb1; 0.91, p = 0.253), upper arm circumference (21.9 &#xb1; 0.94 vs. 21.2 &#xb1; 1.23 cm, p = 0.001), triceps skinfold thickness (15.1 &#xb1; 1.36 vs. 14.3 &#xb1; 1.62 cm, p = 0.007), and grip strength (23.0 &#xb1; 1.30 vs. 22.3 &#xb1; 1.33, p = 0.007). In addition, the experimental group yielded better nutritional-status indicators than the control, including albumin (35.2 &#xb1; 1.60 vs. 33.7 &#xb1; 1.44 g/L, p = 0.001), hemoglobin (115.7 &#xb1; 9.28 vs. 111.5 &#xb1; 10.56 g/L, p = 0.032), total protein (63.7 &#xb1; 5.85 vs. 60.5 &#xb1; 5.27 g/L, p = 0.004), transferrin (2.5 &#xb1; 0.53 vs. 2.2 &#xb1; 0.58 g/L, p = 0.007), and immune-function indicators CD4(32.8 &#xb1; 4.82 vs. 28.8 &#xb1; 3.76, p = 0.001), CD8(34.1 &#xb1; 3.36 vs. 37.2 &#xb1; 3.85, p = 0.001), CD4/CD8 (1.0 &#xb1; 0.28 vs. 0.8 &#xb1; 0.34, p = 0.001), IgA (2.7 &#xb1; 1.43 vs. 4.1 &#xb1; 1.47, p = 0.001), and IgG (8.8 &#xb1; 1.74 vs. 10.9 &#xb1; 1.28, p = 0.001). Combined tumor-specific total nutrient and adjuvant chemotherapy application after radical gastric cancer surgery effectively improves the nutritional state and immune function of the patients and could be applied in clinical practice.
