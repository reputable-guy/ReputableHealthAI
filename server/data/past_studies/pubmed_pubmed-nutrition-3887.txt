Study Title: Safety and Suitability of an Infant Formula Manufactured from Extensively Hydrolysed Protein in Healthy Term Infants.

Study Summary:
We aimed to demonstrate that healthy term infants experience noninferior growth with infant formula manufactured from extensively hydrolysed whey protein (eHF) compared to intact cow's milk protein (control formula, CF). This prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled, multicentre trial included healthy term infants who were exclusively formula-fed. Infants &#x2264; 25 days of age received eHF or CF for at least three months up to 120 days of age, with a follow-up until 180 days of age. A reference group included exclusively breastfed infants (BF). Of 318 infants randomised, 297 (148 CF, 149 eHF) completed the study per protocol. Weight gain up to 120 days of age was noninferior (margin -3.0 g/day) in eHF (28.95 (95% CI: 27.21; 30.68) g/day) compared to CF (28.85 (95% CI: 27.10; 30.61) g/day) with a difference in means of 0.09 g/day and a lower limit of the one-sided 97.5% CI of -0.86 g/day (< 0.0001 for noninferiority testing). Weight gain remained comparable during follow-up. Further anthropometric parameters did not differ between the infant formula groups throughout the study. Growth was comparable in BF. No relevant safety issues were observed. To conclude, eHF meets infant requirements for adequate growth during the first six months of life and can be considered safe and suitable.
