Study Title: Efficacy of Blood Flow Restriction Exercise for Improving Lower Limb Muscle Strength and Function in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Study Summary:
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of low-load (LL) blood flow restriction exercise (BFRE) for improving lower limb muscle strength, muscle thickness and physical function in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). In a randomized sham-controlled trial, 21 participants (age&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years, SCI duration &#x2265;&#x2009;1&#x2009;year, knee extensor strength grade 2-4, ASIA A-D) were randomized to either 45-min LL-BFRE (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) or sham BFRE (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10) twice/week for 8&#x2009;weeks. The exercise protocol consisted of four sets (30&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;15&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;15&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;15 repetitions) of unilateral seated leg extensions and leg curls at 30%-40% of 1RM performed with pneumatic cuffs applied proximally on the trained limb and inflated to 40% of total arterial occlusion pressure (BFRE) or non-inflated (sham exercise). Maximal voluntary isometric quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, quadriceps muscle thickness, thigh circumference, and physical function were assessed at baseline, after 4 and 8&#x2009;weeks of training and at 4-week follow-up. No significant between-group differences were found between BFRE and sham exercise in quadriceps or hamstring muscle strength, 10-m walking test, timed up & go, 6-min walking test or the spinal cord independence measure. In contrast, a significant between-group difference favoring BFRE was present for muscle thickness and thigh circumference from baseline to 4-week follow-up (0.76&#x2009;cm (95% CI: 0.32; 1.20, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and 2.42&#x2009;cm (0.05; 4.79, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05), respectively). In conclusion, there was no significant difference in the effect of LL-BFRE and sham exercise on muscle strength and physical function in individuals with SCI. However, significant increases in muscle thickness and thigh circumference were observed in favor of BFRE. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03690700.
