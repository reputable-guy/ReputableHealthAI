Study Title: Randomised controlled trial of tourniquet associated pain generated in lower limb after exsanguination by Esmarch bandage versus limb elevation.

Study Summary:
Tourniquets are common adjuncts in the operating theatre but can be associated with post-operative pain. This study was designed to compare what effect pre-tourniquet Esmarch bandage exsanguination has on pain, compared to pre-tourniquet exsanguination by elevation alone. 52 volunteers (104 lower limbs) were included in this study with each volunteer acting as their own matched control. The primary outcome was patient reported pain, measured in both legs simultaneously using area under curve. Secondary outcomes were pain score during inflation and deflation, cumulative pain score, duration of recovery and blood pressure during testing. Pain after Esmarch was superior to elevation as measured by area under pain curve (68.9 SD 26.1 vs 77.2 SD 27.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0010), independent of leg dominance. Cumulative pain scores demonstrated the same superiority after inflation (50.7 SD 17.1 vs 52.9 SD 17.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026) but not after deflation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59). Blood pressure was not significantly different. Time to full recovery of the lower limb was the same for both groups-7.6&#xa0;min (SD 2.1&#xa0;min, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.80). Previous studies describe a positive effect on pain when Esmarch bandage was used prior to tourniquet inflation for upper limb. Our findings suggest the same benefit from Esmarch when it was used on lower limbs-particularly during inflation of tourniquet. In addition to pain profiles, surgeon preference and patient factors need to be considered when deciding between elevation and Esmarch bandage.
