Study Title: Remote ischaemic preconditioning on gene expression and circulating proteins after subacute laparoscopic cholecystectomy: randomized clinical trial.

Study Summary:
Surgical stress may lead to postsurgical hypercoagulability, endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation, which can impact on patient recovery. Remote ischaemic preconditioning is a procedure that activates the body's endogenous defences against ischaemia and reperfusion injury. Studies have suggested that remote ischaemic preconditioning has antithrombotic, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The hypothesis was that remote ischaemic preconditioning reduces surgery-induced systemic stress response. During a 24-month period (2019-2021), adult patients undergoing subacute laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis were randomized to remote ischaemic preconditioning or control. Remote ischaemic preconditioning was performed less than 4 h before surgery on the upper arm. It consisted of four cycles of 5 min ischaemia and 5 min reperfusion. The gene expression of 750 genes involved in inflammatory processes, oxidative stress and endothelial function was investigated preoperatively and 2-4 h after surgery in both groups. In addition, changes in 20 inflammation- and vascular trauma-associated proteins were assessed preoperatively, 2-4 h after surgery and 24 h after surgery. A total of 60 patients were randomized. There were no statistically significant differences in gene expression 2-4 h after surgery between the groups (P > 0.05). Remote ischaemic preconditioning did not affect concentrations of circulating proteins up to 24 h after surgery (P > 0.05). The study did not demonstrate any effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning on expression levels of the chosen genes or in circulating immunological cytokines and vascular trauma-associated proteins up to 24&#x2005;h after subacute laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis.
