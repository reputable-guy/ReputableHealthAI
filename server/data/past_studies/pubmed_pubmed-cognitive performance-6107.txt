Study Title: Resistance training modifies of serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases in multiple sclerosis women - a randomized controlled trail.

Study Summary:
The objectives of the present study was to investigate the effects of resistance training (RT) on serum levels of controlling blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability indices and cognitive performance in MS women (MS-W). In this randomized control trail study (IRCT registration code: IRCT20120912010824N3, 07.09.2023), twenty-five MS-W were randomly divided into sedentary (MS) and resistance exercise (12 weeks/3 times per week/ 60-80% of 1RM) (MS&#x2009;+&#x2009;RT) groups. Fifteen healthy aged-matched women participated as a control group (HCON). The serum level of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), tissue metalloproteinase inhibitors-1 (TIMP-1), tissue metalloproteinase inhibitors-2 (TIMP-2), and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) were assessed. In addition, cognitive performance was assessed pre- and post- intervention with the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS). A significant reduction in MMP-2, TIMP-2 serum levels, and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio were observed in post-test for MS&#x2009;+&#x2009;RT group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01) in comparison to the HCON and MS groups; however, no changes were observed in MMP-9, TIMP-1, S100B and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio after RT (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). The verbal learning was improved in post-test for MS&#x2009;+&#x2009;RT group (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01), although no change were observed for visuospatial memory and information processing speed (p&#x2009;>&#x2009;0.05). These findings suggest that resistance training can modify some indices of BBB permeability and improve verbal learning in MS-W. The findings may also be beneficial as a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce inflammation.
