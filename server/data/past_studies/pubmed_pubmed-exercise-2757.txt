Study Title: Effects of Tai Chi training on functionality, dynamic balance, kinesiophobia, and quality of life in athletes with functional ankle instability.

Study Summary:
This study investigated the effects of Tai Chi training on functionality, dynamic balance, kinesiophobia, and quality of life in athletes with Functional Ankle Instability (FAI). Forty-three athletes with FAI were randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) or a control group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;22). The Tai Chi group followed a tailored exercise protocol addressing ankle instability through a three-phase progression, while the control group had no intervention but continued their usual activities. Measurements, including Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT), Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Short Form-12 (SF-12), figure-8 hop test, and perceived treatment effect were assessed before and after the intervention. The Tai Chi group showed significant improvements in CAIT score and SEBT reach distance compared to the control group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Tai Chi exercises also reduced TSK, improved figure-8 hop score, and enhanced the physical component of SF-12 (&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.005), with no significant effect on the mental component of SF-12 (&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7). The findings imply that Tai Chi may be a valuable consideration for athletic trainers and sports medicine professionals working with athletes with FAI.
