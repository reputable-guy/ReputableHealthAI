Study Title: Empowering mind-body wellness: effect of bundling seated exercises and psychoeducational rehabilitation using the teach-back approach on fatigue and coping of women postmastectomy.

Study Summary:
Being diagnosed with Breast Cancer (BC) is a crisis that throws the patient's life out of balance. Cancer-related fatigue is a debilitating sign experienced by women during and after BC treatment. Regular physical exercise may help mitigate patients' fatigue, enhance coping abilities, improve their quality of life, and overall well-being. In parallel, psychological interventions are geared toward normalizing the lived painful experiences among oncology patients. to examine the effect of bundling seated exercises and psychoeducational rehabilitation using the teach-back approach on fatigue and coping of women postmastectomy. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in the Oncology Surgical Department and chemotherapy unit at the Alexandria Main University Hospital, Egypt. A total of 60 women were randomly allocated to either to the study or the control groups. Women in the study group practiced seated exercises and psychological rehabilitation interventions, including mindfulness breathing, problem-solving training, cognitive reframing technique, and thought stopping while the control group received the routine care. The study revealed a significant decline in the fatigue mean scores among participants in the intervention group from 136.10&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;27.76 to 98.43&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;25.99 (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001). Similarly, there was a significant decrease in the patients' mean scores of maladaptive coping, helplessness/ hopelessness (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014), and anxious preoccupation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). In contrast, there is a noticeable increment in the scores of adaptive coping, such as fighting spirit (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012), cognitive avoidance (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), and fatalism (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). Bundling seated exercises and psychological rehabilitation interventions using the teach-back approach have been proven to be simple and inexpensive non-pharmacological methods of reducing cancer-related fatigue and improving coping skills among women post-mastectomy.
