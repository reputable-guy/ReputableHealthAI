Study Title: Effect of traditional Chinese medicine combined group psychotherapy on psychological distress management and gut micro-biome regulation for colorectal cancer survivors: a single-arm phase I clinical trial.

Study Summary:
To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of utilizing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) combined group psychotherapy intervention on psychological distress management and gut micro-biome regulation for colorectal (CRC) survivors. A single-arm phase I clinical trial was conducted between December 2020 and December 2021 in Xiyuan Hospital and Beijing Cancer Hospital in China. Inclusion criteria included stage I-III CRC survivors after radical surgery with age between 18 and 75. The intervention was a 6-week online TCM combined group psychotherapy intervention including 90-min communication, TCM lifestyle coaching, self-acupressure guidance, and mindfulness practice led by TCM oncologist and psychiatrist each week. Outcomes were measured by Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventor (FCRI), and Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). Fecal samples before and after intervention were collected for 16Sr RNA analysis. We recruited 40 CRC survivors and 38 of them finally completed all interventions with average age of 58&#xb1;13 years' old. Paired t-test showed that SAS at week 2(35.4&#xb1;5.8), week 4 (37.9&#xb1;10.5) and week 6 (31.3&#xb1;6.4) during the intervention was significantly lower than baseline (42.1&#xb1;8.3, p<0.05 respectively). SDS score also declined substantially from baseline (38.8&#xb1;10.7) to week 2 (28.3&#xb1;8.8, p<0.001) and week 6 (25.4&#xb1;7.7, p<0.001). FCRI decreased from 19.4&#xb1;7.2 at baseline to 17.5&#xb1;7.1 at week 4 (p=0.038) and 16.3&#xb1;5.8 at week 6 (p=0.008). Although changes of QLQ-C30 were not statistically prominent, symptom burden of insomnia and fatigue significantly alleviated. The abundances of gut microbiota Intestinibacter, Terrisporobacter, Coprobacter, and Gordonibacter were all significantly elevated after intervention. TCM combined group psychotherapy intervention is feasible and effective to reduce CRC survivors' psychological distress and modulate certain gut bacteria which might be associated with brain-gut axis effect. It is necessary to carry out with phase II randomized controlled clinical trial.
