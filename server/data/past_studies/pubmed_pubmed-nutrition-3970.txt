Study Title: Enhancements in yield, agronomic, and zinc recovery efficiencies of rice-wheat system through bioactive zinc coated urea application in Aridisols.

Study Summary:
Zinc (Zn) deficiency and source-dependent Zn fertilization to achieve optimum Zn levels in rice and wheat grains remain global concern for human nutrition, especially in developing countries. To-date, little is known about the effectiveness of bioactive Zn-coated urea (BAZU) to enhance the concentration, uptake, and recovery of Zn in relation to agronomic efficiency in paddy and wheat grains. Field experiments were carried out during 2020-21 on the rice-wheat system at Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Multan, Punjab, Pakistan using four treatments viz.T1 (Urea 46% N @ 185 kg ha-1 + zero Zn), T2 (Urea 46% N @ 185 kg ha-1 + ZnSO4 33% Zn @ 15 kg ha-1), T3 (BAZU 42% N @ 103 kg ha-1 + Urea 46% N @ 62 kg ha-1 + 1% bioactive Zn @ 1.03 kg ha-1) and T4 (BAZU 42% N @ 125 kg ha-1 + Urea 46% N @ 62 kg ha-1 + 1% bioactive Zn @ 1.25 kg ha-1) in quadruplicate under Randomized Complete Block Design. Paddy yield was increased by 13, 11, 12, and 11% whereas wheat grain yield was enhanced by 12, 11, 11, and 10% under T4 at Multan, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Lahore, respectively, compared to T1. Similarly, paddy Zn concentration was increased by 58, 67, 65 and 77% (32.4, 30.7, 31.1, and 34.1 mg kg-1) in rice whereas grain Zn concentration was increased by 90, 87, 96 and 97% (46.2, 43.9, 46.7 and 44.9 mg kg-1) in wheat by the application of BAZU (T4) at Multan, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Lahore, respectively, in comparison to T1. Zinc recovery was about 9-fold and 11-fold higher in paddy and wheat grains, respectively, under BAZU (T4) treatment relative to T2 while, the agronomic efficiency was enhanced up to 130% and 141% in rice and wheat respectively as compared to T2. Thus, T4 application at the rate of 125 kg ha-1 could prove effective in enhancing the rice paddy and wheat grain yield along with their Zn biofortification (&#x223c;34 mg kg-1 and &#x223c;47 mg kg-1, respectively) through increased agronomic and Zn recovery efficiencies, the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms of which can be further explored in future.
