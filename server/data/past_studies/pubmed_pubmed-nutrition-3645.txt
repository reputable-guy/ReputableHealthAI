Study Title: Effect of dietary supplementation with multinutrient soy flour on body composition and cognitive function in elderly individuals at the risk of low protein: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Study Summary:
Insufficient protein intake and cognitive decline are common in older adults; however, there have been few studies on low protein risk screening and complex nutrient interventions for elderly individuals in rural communities. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary multinutrient soy flour (MNSF) on body composition and cognitive function in elderly individuals who are at risk of protein deficiency in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Nutritional interventions were given to those found to have low protein levels using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Among 733 older adults screened, 62 participants were included and randomly assigned into two groups, one taking soy flour and the other taking MNSF for 12 weeks. A previous cross-sectional survey found that 35.1% of the elderly people with an average age of 71.61 &#xb1; 5.94 years had an inadequate body protein mass proportion. After the intervention, the MNSF group demonstrated a significant improvement in protein mass, muscle mass, mineral levels, skeletal muscle mass, and fat-free mass compared with baseline (all< 0.05), as well as a better upward trend compared with the soy flour group (= 0.08;= 0.07;= 0.05;= 0.08;= 0.07). Regarding the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, the MNSF group showed a significant decrease after 12 weeks (< 0.05), which were significantly different compared with the soy flour group (< 0.05). In the future, the application of MNSF as a food-based supplement to improve nutrition and delay cognitive decline in older adults at the risk of protein deficiency may be considered.
