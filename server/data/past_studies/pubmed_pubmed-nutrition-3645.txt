Study Title: Effects of nutritional therapy on gastrointestinal microbial digestion and barrier defense markers in elderly patients with diabetes.

Study Summary:
We sought to investigate the effects of gastrointestinal nutrition therapy on gastrointestinal microbial digestion and barrier defense markers in elderly patients with diabetes. A total of 120 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled at our hospital between January 2020 and December 2022. The participants in this study were randomly allocated into either the nutritional group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) who underwent gastrointestinal nutrition therapy or the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) who underwent conventional T2DM diet management for a period of 12&#xa0;weeks. Clinical data, as well as small intestinal permeability measured by the lactulose-mannitol urine test, plasma circulating IL-6 and zonulin levels measured by ELISA, and expressions of ZO-1 and Claudin-3 in blood analyzed through Western blotting were collected. The nutrition group demonstrated a higher proportion of patients achieving HbA1c&#x2009;<&#x2009;7% compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Moreover, the nutrition group exhibited a greater reduction in fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The concentrations of formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase and acetic CoA transferase were significantly increased in the nutrition group compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Fecal analysis revealed higher levels of acetic acid and butyric acid in the nutrition group compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). The ratio of lactulose to mannitol was higher in the nutrition group compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Furthermore, the nutrition group showed lower levels of IL-6 and zonulin compared to the control group (P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Personalized gastrointestinal nutrition therapy was found to enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids and preserve intestinal permeability, leading to improved gastrointestinal microbial digestion and barrier defense in elderly patients with diabetes.
