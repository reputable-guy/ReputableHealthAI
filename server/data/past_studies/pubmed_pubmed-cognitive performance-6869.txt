Study Title: Motor Imagery during Action Observation of Locomotor Tasks Improves Rehabilitation Outcome in Older Adults after Total Hip Arthroplasty.

Study Summary:
This study aimed at determining whether the combination of action observation and motor imagery (AO&#x2009;+&#x2009;MI) of locomotor tasks could positively affect rehabilitation outcome after hip replacement surgery. Of initially 405 screened participants, 21 were randomly split into intervention group (= 10; mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;64&#x2009;y; AO&#x2009;+&#x2009;MI of locomotor tasks: 30&#x2009;min/day in the hospital, then 3&#xd7;/week in their homes for two months) and control group (= 11, mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;63&#x2009;y, active controls). The functional outcomes (Timed Up and Go, TUG; Four Step Square Test, FSST; and single- and dual-task gait and postural control) were measured before (PRE) and 2 months after surgery (POST). Significant interactions indicated better rehabilitation outcome for the intervention group as compared to the control group: at POST, the intervention group revealed faster TUG (= 0.042), FSST (= 0.004), and dual-task fast-paced gait speed (= 0.022), reduced swing-time variability (= 0.005), and enhanced cognitive performance during dual tasks while walking or balancing (< 0.05). In contrast, no changes were observed for body sway parameters (&#x2265; 0.229). These results demonstrate that AO&#x2009;+&#x2009;MI is efficient to improve motor-cognitive performance after hip surgery. Moreover, only parameters associated with locomotor activities improved whereas balance skills that were not part of the AO&#x2009;+&#x2009;MI intervention were not affected, demonstrating the specificity of training intervention. Overall, utilizing AO&#x2009;+&#x2009;MI during rehabilitation is advised, especially when physical practice is limited.
