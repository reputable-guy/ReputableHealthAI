Study Title: Epigenetic impact of a 1-week intensive multimodal group program for adolescents with multiple adverse childhood experiences.

Study Summary:
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs, i.e., abuse, neglect, household dysfunction) represent a potential risk factor for a wide range of long-lasting diseases and shorter life expectancy. We recently described a 1-week residential group program, based on mindfulness training, artistic expression and EMDR group therapy, that significantly reduced PTSD-related symptoms and increased attention/awareness-related outcomes in adolescent girls with multiple ACEs in a randomized controlled study. Since epigenetic mechanisms (i.e., DNA methylation) have been associated with the long-lasting effects of ACEs, the present report extends these prior findings by exploring genome-wide DNA methylation changes following the program. Saliva samples from all participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;44) were collected and genomic DNA was extracted prior (T1) and following (T2) the intervention. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the MethylationEPIC beadchip array (Illumina) revealed 49 differentially methylated loci (DML; p value&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001; methylation change&#x2009;>&#x2009;10%) that were annotated to genes with roles in&#xa0;biological processes linked to early childhood adversity (i.e., neural, immune, and endocrine pathways, cancer and cardiovascular disease). DNA sequences flanking these DML showed significant enrichment of transcription factor binding sites involved in inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and brain development. Methylation changes in SIRT5 and TRAPPC2L genes showed associations with changes in trauma-related psychological measures. Results presented here suggest that this multimodal group program for adolescents with multiple victimization modulates the DNA methylome at sites of potential relevance for health and behavioral disorders associated with ACEs.
