Study Title: Nutraceutical blends predict enhanced health via microbiota reshaping improving cytokines and life quality: a Brazilian double-blind randomized trial.

Study Summary:
Nutraceutical interventions supporting microbiota and eliciting clinical improvements in metabolic diseases have grown significantly. Chronic stress, gut dysbiosis, and metainflammation have emerged as key factors intertwined with sleep disorders, consequently exacerbating the decline in quality of life. This study aimed to assess the effects of two nutraceutical formulations containing prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), yeast &#x3b2;-glucans), minerals (Mg, Se, Zn), and the herbal medicine Silybum marianum L. Gaertn., Asteraceae (Milk thistle or Silymarin). These formulations, namely NSupple (without silymarin) and NSupple_Silybum (with silymarin) were tested over 180&#xa0;days in overweight/obese volunteers from Brazil's southeastern region. We accessed fecal gut microbiota by partial 16S rRNA sequences; cytokines expression by CBA; anthropometrics, quality of life and sleep, as well as metabolic and hormonal parameters, at baseline (T0) and 180&#xa0;days (T180) post-supplementation. Results demonstrated gut microbiota reshaping at phyla, genera, and species level post-supplementation. The Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroides, and Prevotella genera were positively modulated especially in the NSupple_Silybum group. Gut microbiota modulation was associated with improved sleep patterns, quality-of-life perception, cytokines expression, and anthropometric parameters post-supplementation. Our findings suggest that the nutraceutical blends positively enhance cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers. Particularly, NSupple_Silybum modulated microbiota composition, underscoring its potential significance in ameliorating metabolic dysregulation.
