Study Title: Improving Lower Limb Function and Frailty in Frail Older Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Randomized Controlled Study of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation.

Study Summary:
A global public health problem, frailty is closely associated with poor prognosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in older patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Although exercise intervention is the most commonly used method to reverse and alleviate frailty, its application is restricted in patients with acute myocardial infarction following PCI due to cardiovascular instability and autonomic imbalance. Consequently, there is a need for a new practical intervention to address frailty syndrome in these patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in frail older AMI patients post-PCI. A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine from March to October 2023. A total of 100 eligible participants were randomly divided into two groups: experimental (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;50) and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;50) groups, respectively. Both groups received usual care. The experimental group underwent neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on bilateral quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles for 30 minutes daily from day 1 to day 7 after surgery. The primary outcomes measured included the frailty score, lower limb muscle strength, and lower limb muscle quality. Secondary outcomes included the activities of daily living score, inflammatory markers, and length of hospital stay. All participants were included in an intention-to-treat analysis after the study ended. The frailty scores of the two groups exhibited a gradual decrease over time, and the scores of the experimental group were lower than those of the control group at 4 and 7 days after surgery (P<0.001). Concurrently, the lower limb muscle strength showed an increasing trend over the time in the experimental group and a decreasing trend in the control group, and the scores of the experimental group surpassed those of the control group (p<0.001). Moreover, a statistical difference was observed in the lower limb muscle mass across the groups after 7 days postoperatively compared with baseline on both sides (p<0.05). Neuromuscular electrical stimulation has the potential to enhance lower limb function and alleviate frailty in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction after PCI. These findings introduce a novel intervention approach for frailty management in the elderly population.
