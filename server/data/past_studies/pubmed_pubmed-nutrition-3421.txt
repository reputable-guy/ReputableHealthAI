Study Title: Reversing malnutrition and low muscle strength with targeted enteral feeding in patients awaiting liver transplant: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Most patients with decompensated cirrhosis fail to meet their nutrition targets. The impact of nasogastric feeding (NGF) on malnutrition in cirrhosis remains unknown. This study aims to assess the impact of pretransplant NGF on pre-liver transplant and post-liver transplant outcomes. This single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial of 55 patients with severe malnutrition and low handgrip strength (HGS) compared a standard high-energy high-protein diet to diet plus supplemental nocturnal NGF while awaiting transplant. The primary outcome was a change in HGS. The median age was 58.5 years (IQR: 51.1-64), median MELD was 24 (20-28.5), and 32 (58%) patients were male. The median duration of NGF was 63.0 days (34.5-127), following which time the median between-group difference in HGS was 3.6&#xa0;kg (95% CI: 1.7-5.2, p <0.001), an increase of 20% from baseline. Mid-upper-arm circumference, triceps skinfold, and immune function all increased significantly with NGF. Muscle and nutritional parameters continued to improve with increasing duration of feeding. NGF significantly increased daily energy intake between groups by 1285&#xa0;kcal (95% CI: 860-1677) and protein intake by 51&#xa0;g (95% CI: 32-71) (both p <0.001). All NGF patients met >100% of their measured nutritional requirements. Posttransplant clinical outcomes were similar between groups. Targeted enteral feeding before liver transplant improves HGS, anthropometry, and immune function in severely malnourished patients with cirrhosis. These findings provide a strong rationale for early consideration of NGF to reverse malnutrition and improve muscle strength. Appropriately powered studies should explore whether NGF can also impact clinically relevant outcomes including pretransplant and posttransplant mortality.
