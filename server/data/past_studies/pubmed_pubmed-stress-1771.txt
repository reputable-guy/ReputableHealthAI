Study Title: Effects of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on regulating lifestyle behaviors and mental wellness in healthy adults based on the microbiome-gut-brain axis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Our study aimed to explore the efficacy of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on specific neurotransmitters and hormones and the ability to regulate lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults. In total, 120 healthy adults with high mental stress, overweight, insomnia, and constipation were randomly assigned to receive low-dose B. breve 207-1 (LD, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40), high-dose B. breve 207-1 (HD, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40), or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) for 28 days. Fecal and blood samples were collected and questionnaires were answered before and after the trial. Neurotransmitters and serum hormones were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16&#xa0;S rRNA sequencing. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations were determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The primary outcome of our study was changes in mental wellness, including neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrena (HPA) axis hormones, and the psychological scales. The results showed that &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased significantly and the HPA axis hormones were suppressed overall in the probiotic groups while 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) did not change significantly. However, there was no significant change in mood scale scores. The secondary outcome focused on the ability of 207-1 to regulate the body and lifestyle of healthy adults (e.g., sleep, diet, exercise, etc.). The PSQI scores in the probiotics groups significantly decreased, indicating improved sleep quality. Meanwhile, the probiotic groups had a slight increase in exercise consumption while dietary intake stabilized. By physical examination, the participants showed weight loss although no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. Then, validated by gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota were observed under the effective intervention of 207-1 while short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased in the LD group, particularly acetic and propionic acids. There was a slight decrease in alpha-diversity in the HD group. Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 entered the organism and affected neurotransmitter and the HPA axis hormone levels via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Meanwhile, 207-1 supplementation improved daily lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults, which may in turn lead to changes in their bodies (e.g. weight and lipid metabolism). However, this study did not find significant mood-modulating efficacy. The mechanism of the overall study is unclear, but we hypothesize that SCFAs may be the key pathway, and more experiments are needed for validation in the future. This trial was retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the accession number ChiCTR2300069453 on March 16, 2023.
