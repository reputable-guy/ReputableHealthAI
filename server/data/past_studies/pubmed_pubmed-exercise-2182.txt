Study Title: Influence of core stabilization exercise on physical function and muscle thickness in patients with chronic stroke: A randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Summary:
This study primarily aims to compare the influence of core stabilization exercise and conventional therapy on motor function, functional independence, and balance, secondarily gait ability, quality of life, and sonographically evaluated core muscle thickness in patients with chronic stroke. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups: core stabilization exercise therapy (CSET,&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) group received core stability training for 15&#x2005;min and 30&#x2005;min of conventional therapy each per day, and conventional exercise therapy (CET,&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) group received conventional therapy for 45&#x2005;min per day, five days per week, for three weeks. Ultrasonography was performed to measure the thickness of the core muscles on both paretic and nonparetic sides. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after three weeks treatment. Functional Independence Measurement, Berg Balance Scale, 6-Minute Walk Test, Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale and core muscles thicknesses improved significantly in both groups except for the internal oblique muscle of CSET group. The nonparetic side multifidus muscle thickness was significantly different in favor of CSET group (&#x2009;=&#x2009;.033). Conventional and core stabilization exercise therapies in patients with chronic stroke have positive effects on functional independence, balance and gait abilities, quality of life and core muscles thicknesses without being superior to each other.
