Study Title: Effects of a 4-Week Detraining Period After 12 Weeks of Combined Training Using Different Weekly Frequencies on Health-Related Physical Fitness in Older Adults.

Study Summary:
Detraining refers to the decline in physical fitness that occurs after the cessation of exercise, compromising the adaptations resulting from regular exercise training. To understand how long the benefits acquired from an exercise program can be maintained, the present study evaluated the detraining effects of a 4-week exercise cessation period in older adults who performed combined training at various weekly frequencies for 12 weeks. This randomized controlled trial assigned participants to one of two training programs: a combined training program twice a week (CT2) or four times a week (CT4) over a period of 12 weeks, followed by a four-week detraining period. The resistance training consisted of six bodyweight exercises, while the aerobic training involved either walking or running. Both the CT2 and CT4 groups completed the same total training volume and overload each week; the only difference was the number of training sessions per week. Assessments were conducted at baseline, after the training period, and after the detraining period, and included the 30-s and five-repetition chair-stand tests, isometric handgrip strength, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio. Thirty-one participants completed the study (CT2: 17 and CT4: 14). The groups presented similar attendance records during the training period (CT2: 96 &#xb1; 18% versus CT4: 94 &#xb1; 19%). After the 12-week training period, CT2 and CT4 improved lower limb strength, CT2 improved upper limb strength, and CT4 reduced waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio compared to baseline. After the 4-week detraining period, the lower limb strength remained improved in both groups (CT2: 4 &#xb1; 1 repetition;< 0.001 and CT4: 4 &#xb1; 1 repetition;< 0.001) when compared to the corresponding baseline values. The handgrip strength decreased in CT2 compared to post-training values. And the body composition benefit in CT4 was not sustained after detraining. The effects of 4 weeks of detraining after 12 weeks of training performed two or four times per week are similar on some but not all health-related physical fitness parameters.
