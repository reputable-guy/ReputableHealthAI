Study Title: Impact of a Virtual Wellness Program on Quality of Life Measures for Patients Living With Multiple Sclerosis During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Study Summary:
Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were vulnerable to the effects of physical inactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. As patients returned to in-person visits, providers reported seeing increased weakness, balance issues, falls, worsening pain, and spasticity. Social isolation also contributed to increased stress, depression, and anxiety. This study explored whether attending virtual wellness programs was associated with improvements in standard quality of life questionnaire scores for patients with MS. The purposive convenience sample consisted of 43 patients in the treatment group and 28 in the control group. Patients in the treatment group attended 2 monthly programs for 6 months and completed a demographic questionnaire, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, and the Medical Outcomes Study Pain Effects Scale (PES). Patients requested additional topics, resulting in 5 additional programs. The control group consisted of patients who chose not to attend the programs but agreed to complete the questionnaires. In comparing questionnaire responses (6 months minus baseline) among the participants in the treatment group, an association was found between higher meeting attendance and improvements in emotional well-being (= .038), pain on the PES (= .011), mindfulness on the SF-36 pain scale (= .0472), and exercise on the PES (= .0115). The results of this study suggest that a virtual wellness program may provide beneficial emotional support, physical exercise, and health promotion activities resulting in improved quality of life in people with MS. In addition, mindfulness and exercise programs may be beneficial in pain management.
