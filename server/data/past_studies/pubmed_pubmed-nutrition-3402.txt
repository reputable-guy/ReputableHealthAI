Study Title: Multidisciplinary management based on clinical nursing pathway model for the treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage: A randomized controlled trial.

Study Summary:
To explore the effectiveness of multidisciplinary management based on a clinical nursing pathway model for the treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH). A total of 124 patients with HICH admitted to our hospital between February 2021 and June 2023 were selected as research subjects in this randomized, controlled, unblinded study. They were divided into Control-group and Study-group using a random number table method, with 62 cases in each group. The Control-group received routine care and the Study-group adopted a multidisciplinary management approach based on the clinical nursing pathway model. A multidisciplinary intervention group including 1 attending physician, 1 psychotherapist, 1 nutritionist, 1 rehabilitation specialist, and 4 responsible nurses was constructed. From preoperative to postoperative day, patients were provided with psychological intervention, health education, respiratory tract management, and specific care for patients who were restless. One to 3 days after operation, the patients and their family members were guided in basic postoperative care and nutrition care. From the 4th day after surgery to the 1st day before discharge, patients were guided for rehabilitation exercises. Patients also received discharge advices upon discharge. Activities of daily living, neurological function, stress response indicators, incidence of complications, and nursing satisfaction before and after the intervention were compared between the 2 groups. After the intervention, the activities of daily living and neurological function of the 2 groups were significantly improved compared to before the intervention, and the Study-group was significantly higher than the Control-group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). After intervention, the levels of stress response indicators in both groups significantly decreased compared to before the intervention, and the Study-group was significantly lower than the Control-group (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). The incidence of complications in the Study-group (3.23%) was lower than that in the Control-group (15.00%) (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Nursing satisfaction in the Study-group (95.16%) was higher than that in the Control-group (83.33%) (P&#x2005;<&#x2005;.05). Our findings indicate that adopting a multidisciplinary management approach based on clinical nursing pathways to intervene in patients with HICH can reduce stress response levels, reduce the risk of complications, and facilitate the recovery of neurological function and activities of daily living with high patient satisfaction.
