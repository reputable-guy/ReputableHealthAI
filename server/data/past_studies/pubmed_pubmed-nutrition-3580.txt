Study Title: Early time-restricted carbohydrate consumption vs conventional dieting in type 2 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial.

Study Summary:
Early time-restricted carbohydrate consumption (eTRC) is a novel dietary strategy that involves restricting carbohydrate-rich food intake to the morning and early afternoon to align with circadian variations in glucose tolerance. We examined the efficacy, feasibility and safety of eTRC in individuals with type 2 diabetes under free-living conditions. In this randomised, parallel-arm, open label, controlled trial, participants with type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity (age 67.2&#xb1;7.9 years, 47.8% women, BMI 29.4&#xb1;3.7 kg/m, HbA49&#xb1;5 mmol/mol [6.6&#xb1;0.5%]) were randomised, using computer-generated random numbers, to a 12 week eTRC diet or a Mediterranean-style control diet with matched energy restriction and macronutrient distribution (50% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 20% protein). The primary outcome was the between-group difference in HbAat 12 weeks. Body composition, 14 day flash glucose monitoring and food diary analysis were performed every 4 weeks. Mixed meal tolerance tests with mathematical beta cell function modelling were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Twelve (85.7%) participants in the eTRC arm and 11 (84.6%) participants in the control arm completed the study, achieving similar reductions in body weight and fat mass. The two groups experienced comparable improvements in HbA(-3 [-6, -0.3] mmol/mol vs -4 [-6, -2] mmol/mol, corresponding to -0.2 [-0.5, 0]% and -0.3 [-0.5, -0.1]%, respectively, p=0.386), fasting plasma glucose, flash glucose monitoring-derived glucose variability and mixed meal tolerance test-derived glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, insulin clearance and plasma glucagon levels, without changes in model-derived beta cell function parameters, glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and non-esterified fatty acid levels. The two diets similarly reduced liver function markers and triglyceride levels, being neutral on other cardiometabolic and safety variables. In exploratory analyses, diet-induced changes in body weight and glucometabolic variables were not related to the timing of carbohydrate intake. The proposed eTRC diet provides a feasible and effective alternative option for glucose and body weight management in individuals with type 2 diabetes, with no additional metabolic benefits compared with conventional dieting.
