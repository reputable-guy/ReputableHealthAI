Study Title: Branched-chain ketoacid co-ingestion with protein lowers amino acid oxidation during hemodialysis: A randomized controlled cross-over trial.

Study Summary:
Hemodialysis removes amino acids from the circulation, thereby stimulating muscle proteolysis. Protein ingestion during hemodialysis can compensate for amino acid removal but may also increase uremic toxin production. Branched-chain ketoacid (BCKA) co-ingestion may provide an additional anabolic stimulus without adding to uremic toxin accumulation. In the present study we assessed the impact of BCKA co-ingestion with protein on forearm amino acid balance and amino acid oxidation during hemodialysis. Nine patients (age: 73&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;10&#xa0;y) on chronic hemodialysis participated in this crossover trial. During two 4-h hemodialysis sessions, patients ingested 18&#xa0;g protein with (PRO&#xa0;+&#xa0;BCKA) or without (PRO) 9&#xa0;g BCKAs in a randomized order. Test beverages were labeled with L-[ring-C]-phenylalanine and provided throughout the last 3&#xa0;h of hemodialysis as 18 equal sips consumed with 10-min intervals. Arterial and venous plasma as well as breath samples were collected frequently throughout hemodialysis. Arterial plasma total amino acid (TAA) concentrations during PRO and PRO&#xa0;+&#xa0;BCKA treatments were significantly lower after 1&#xa0;h of hemodialysis (2.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.3 and 2.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.3&#xa0;mmol/L, respectively) when compared to pre-hemodialysis concentrations (4.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.0 and 4.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.5&#xa0;mmol/L, respectively; time effect: P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). Arterial plasma TAA concentrations increased throughout test beverage ingestion (time effect: P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.027) without differences between treatments (time&#x2217;treatment: P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.62). Forearm arteriovenous TAA balance during test beverage ingestion did not differ between timepoints (time effect: P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.31) or treatments (time&#x2217;treatment: P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.34). Whole-body phenylalanine oxidation was 33&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;16% lower during PRO&#xa0;+&#xa0;BCKA when compared to PRO treatments (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). BCKA co-ingestion with protein during hemodialysis does not improve forearm net protein balance but lowers amino acid oxidation.
