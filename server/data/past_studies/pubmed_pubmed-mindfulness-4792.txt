Study Title: Development of an American Indian Diabetes Education Cultural Supplement: A Qualitative Approach.

Study Summary:
The purpose of this study was to culturally enhance a diabetes education program for Din&#xe9; (Navajo) community members with Type 2 diabetes. Though the recommendation to culturally adapt health education curricula was meant to improve health education for American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AIANs), it has inadvertently created a "one size fits all" approach. This approach does not properly address the need for tribe-specific cultural health messaging, defined as incorporating cultural elements deemed relevant to the population. Tribe-specific health information and programming, such as integrating Din&#xe9; worldviews and Indigenous knowledge among Din&#xe9; people as described here, are essential to creating a culturally relevant and effective and meaningful approach to disease self-management. A conversation guide, based on the H&#xf3;zh&#xf3; Resilience Model-a Din&#xe9; framework on healthy living, was used to engage key cultural experts in interviews about traditional stories and teachings regarding health and wellness. Three specific self-care behaviors relevant to Type 2 diabetes self-management were discussed: (1) healthy eating, (2) physical activity, and (3) healthy coping. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a qualitative thematic analysis method. Din&#xe9; healers and cultural experts informed the development of an educational tool called Din&#xe9; Health. Key themes that emerged from the data included the importance of discipline, positivity and mindfulness in the context of H&#xf3;zh&#xf3;. Culturally safe and meaningful engagement with cultural leaders and the use of qualitative research methods can inform deep-level cultural adaptations essential to developing tribe-specific diabetes education programs. The approaches used here can guide the development, implementation, and testing of culturally-informed health education for AIAN populations.
