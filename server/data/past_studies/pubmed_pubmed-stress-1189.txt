Study Title: Impact of dietary supplementation of glycocalyx precursors on vascular function in type 2 diabetes.

Study Summary:
Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is thought to contribute to impaired shear stress mechanotransduction, leading to endothelial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular disease. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx with dietary supplementation of glycocalyx precursors (DSGPs, containing glucosamine sulfate, fucoidan, superoxide dismutase, and high-molecular weight hyaluronan) improves endothelial function and other indices of vascular function in T2D. First, in db/db mice, we showed that treatment with DSGP (100 mg/kg/day) for 4 wk restored endothelial glycocalyx length, as assessed via atomic force microscopy in aortic explants. Restoration of the glycocalyx with DSGP was accompanied by improved flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and reduced arterial stiffness in isolated mesenteric arteries. Further corroborating these findings, the treatment of cultured endothelial cells with that same mixture of glycocalyx precursors promoted glycocalyx growth. Next, as an initial step to investigate the translatability of these findings, we conducted a pilot (= 22) double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of DSGP (3,712.5 mg/day) for 8 wk on endothelial glycocalyx integrity and indices of vascular function, including FMD, in Veterans with T2D. Contrary to the hypothesis, DSGP neither enhanced endothelial glycocalyx integrity nor improved vascular function indices relative to placebo. Together, these findings conceptually support the notion that restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx can lead to improvements in vascular function in a mouse model of T2D; however, DSGP as a therapeutic strategy to enhance vascular function in individuals with T2D does not appear to be efficacious.Endothelial glycocalyx degradation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is thought to contribute to impaired shear stress mechanotransduction, leading to vascular dysfunction. The findings of this study support the notion that restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx using a dietary supplementation of glycocalyx precursors can lead to improvements in vascular function in diabetic mice. However, the utilized dietary supplement as a therapeutic strategy to enhance vascular function in individuals with T2D is not efficacious.
