Study Title: Low-dose sufentanil does not affect tolerance to LBNP-induced central hypovolemia or blood pressure responses during a cold pressor test.

Study Summary:
Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in the prehospital setting. Since trauma-induced pain often accompanies a hemorrhagic insult, the administered pain medication must not interfere with critical autonomic regulation of arterial blood pressure and vital organ perfusion. The purpose of this study was to test two unrelated hypotheses:) sublingual sufentanil (Dsuvia) impairs tolerance to progressive central hypovolemia and) sublingual sufentanil attenuates pain sensation and the accompanying cardiovascular responses to a noxious stimulus. Twenty-nine adults participated in this double-blinded, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. After sublingual administration of sufentanil (30 &#x3bc;g) or placebo, participants completed a progressive lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) challenge to tolerance (). After a recovery period, participants completed a cold pressor test (CPT;). Addressing the first aim, tolerance to LBNP was not different between trials (= 0.495). Decreases in systolic blood pressure from baseline to the end of LBNP also did not differ between trials (time< 0.001, trial= 0.477, interaction= 0.587). Finally, increases in heart rate from baseline to the end of LBNP did not differ between trials (time< 0.001, trial= 0.626, interaction= 0.424). Addressing the second aim, sufentanil attenuated perceived pain (< 0.001) in response to the CPT, though the magnitude of the change in mean blood pressure during the CPT (= 0.078) was not different between trials. These data demonstrate that sublingual sufentanil does not impair tolerance to progressive central hypovolemia. Additionally, sublingual sufentanil attenuates perceived pain, but not the accompanying mean blood pressure responses to the CPT.Addressing two unique aims, we observed that sublingual sufentanil administration does not impair tolerance or cardiovascular responses to lower-body negative pressure (LBNP)-induced progressive central hypovolemia. Second, despite pain perception being reduced, sublingual sufentanil did not attenuate mean blood pressure responses to a cold pressor test (CPT).
