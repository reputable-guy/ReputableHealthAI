Study Title: Supporting Sustainable Health Behavior Change: The Whole is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts.

Study Summary:
Behavior change is the foundation for effective lifestyle prescriptions, yet such change is individualized, nonlinear and typically requires ongoing support. Health and wellness coaching (HWC) is a behavior change intervention with rapidly accruing evidence of positive impact on health behaviors such as exercise, nutrition and stress management. Furthermore, HWC enhances prevention and mitigates exacerbation of chronic lifestyle diseases, at least in the short-term (up to 6 months post intervention). Although the impact on long-term stability of behavior change remains unclear, it is evident that effective partnering with patients using key communication strategies, autonomy promotion, and flexible permissiveness can empower patients to develop healthy lifestyles. This partnership can be cultivated by clinicians as well as clinical team members including nationally board-certified coaches. Although much research is needed regarding the ongoing maintenance of lifestyle changes beyond 6 months, this article seeks to equip clinicians with current evidence, theoretical insights and practical strategies from a "coach approach" to foster more intrinsic forms of motivation which, in turn, empowers patients to adopt and maintain health-promoting behaviors.
