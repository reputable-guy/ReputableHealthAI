Study Title: Immersive Virtual Reality Decreases Work Rate and Manipulates Attentional Focus During Self-Regulated Vigorous Exercise.

Study Summary:
To determine the effect of immersive virtual reality use on finishing time of a vigorous-intensity self-regulated exercise task, and on relevant psychological variables. Healthy untrained adults (&#x2009;=&#x2009;21; 10 men/11 women; age&#x2009;=&#x2009;22.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.2&#x2009;years; BMI&#x2009;=&#x2009;24.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.5&#x2009;kg/m) completed 1500-m exercise bouts on a rowing ergometer in a counterbalanced and randomized order, with and without use of a headset-delivered virtual reality fitness program. Heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, affective valence, and attentional focus were collected every 300&#x2009;m, in addition to finishing time. Data were analyzed with repeated measures as appropriate. Intensity of both exercise bouts was considered vigorous according to heart rate results (>77% maximal heart rate). Finishing time was faster in the control condition (449.57&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;82.39 s) than in the virtual reality condition (463.00&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;91.78 s),&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007. Compared to the control condition, the virtual reality condition was characterized by a more external attentional focus (52.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;18.22 vs. 38.76&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;17.81,&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001). No differences were observed for remaining variables as a result of condition (&#x2009;>&#x2009;.05 for all). When a headset-delivered VR program was used during a self-regulated vigorous-intensity exercise task, participants were 13.6&#x2009;seconds (~3%) slower than in a control condition. Attentional focus was manipulated to be more external with VR use, which may have ultimately distracted from the exercise objective. Recommendations for selecting an appropriate virtual reality experience for a given exercise task are discussed.
