Study Title: Association of chronic liver disease with cognition and brain volumes in two randomized controlled trial populations.

Study Summary:
We examined the association of chronic liver disease with cognition and brain imaging markers of cognitive impairment using data from two large randomized controlled trials that included participants based on diabetes and hypertension, two common systemic risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia. We performed post hoc analyses using data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) studies, which included participants with diabetes and hypertension, respectively. Data were from the NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center. In ACCORD, our measure of chronic liver disease was the Dallas Steatosis Index (DSI). In SPRINT, we used self-reported chronic liver disease. We used linear regression to evaluate the association between the measure of chronic liver disease and both baseline and longitudinal cognitive test performance and brain magnetic resonance imaging volume measurements. Among 2969 diabetic participants in ACCORD, the mean age of participants was 62&#xa0;years, 47% were women. The median DSI was 1.0 (IQR, 0.2-1.8); a DSI of 1.0 corresponds to approximately a&#xa0;>&#xa0;70% probability of having NAFLD. Among 2890 hypertensive participants in SPRINT, the mean age was 68&#xa0;years, and 37% were women, and 60 (2.1%) had chronic liver disease. There were no consistent associations between liver disease and cognitive performance or brain volumes at baseline or longitudinally after adjustment. Markers of chronic liver disease were not associated with cognitive impairment or related brain imaging markers among individuals with diabetes and hypertension.
