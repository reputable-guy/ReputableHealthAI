Complete Surveys: You will be required to complete two surveysâ€”one at the start of the study (baseline, 0 weeks) and another at the end of the study (4 weeks). These surveys are designed to gather information on your sleep patterns, well-being, and other relevant metrics.\n\n2. Connect and Wear Your Oura Device: You will need to connect your Oura Ring device to the Reputable platform. This connection will allow us to collect objective data on your sleep and other health-related biomarker metrics continuously throughout the study period. It is important that you keep your Oura Ring charged and wear it over the course of the study period.\n\n3. Intervention Adherence: You will be asked to consume the supplement as directed, 5 days on (taking the supplement) and 2 days off (not taking the supplement). It is important that you follow these instructions carefully to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the study's results. You will be automatically withdrawn from the study if you fail to meet a 70% compliance threshold. Compliance is defined as you confirming that you took or did not take the supplement in the Reputable Health app daily."

You will also be contributing to a foundation of scientific knowledge that will contribute to the growth of a body of research assessing the effectiveness of organic sleep supplementation on sleep and health.\n\nWhile the study has the potential to provide these benefits, it is important to note that benefits are not guaranteed, and the primary goal of the research is to gather data that will contribute to scientific understanding.
