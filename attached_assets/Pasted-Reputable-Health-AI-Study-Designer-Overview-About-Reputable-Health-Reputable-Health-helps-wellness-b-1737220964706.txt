Reputable Health AI Study Designer Overview
About Reputable Health
Reputable Health helps wellness brands conduct clinical research using our technology platform. We manage the entire research lifecycle:
Study Design: Automating protocol creation based on customer goals.
Participant Recruitment: Ensuring the right participants join the study.
Participant Management: Maintaining engagement and compliance throughout the study.
Data Analysis & Reporting: Delivering defensible results and insights through a comprehensive final report.
Data Collection Approach
Our platform emphasizes passive data collection through wearable devices (e.g., Oura Rings, Whoop Bands) to minimize manual input from participants.
Objective metrics: Wearables capture key data points like REM sleep, deep sleep, and sleep efficiency for sleep studies.
Validated questionnaires: Used strategically to complement wearable data and add subjective insights.
This combination improves data accuracy and compliance compared to manual reporting alone (e.g., subjective responses to "How well did you sleep?").

AI Study Designer Overview
The AI Study Designer is an automated tool that generates study protocols based on customer inputs. It simplifies the study creation process while ensuring scientific rigor and transparency.
Example Use Case:
A wellness brand with a magnesium sleep supplement can use the AI Study Designer to generate a study protocol that measures the efficacy of the supplement on improving participants' REM sleep and sleep efficiency.

User Flow & Requirements
Initiation:
The AI Study Designer is launched from the Reputable Health homepage by customers exploring the platform.
The tool prompts users for key details and automatically generates a complete study protocol.
Information Required from the Customer:
Product Name: The product being studied.
Website URL: Link to product information (if available).
Goal of the Study: (Select one)
Gain quick insights from a small pilot.
Generate marketing claims to increase product sales.
Prepare data for publication in scientific journals.

AI-Generated Study Components
The AI Study Designer automatically generates the following values based on customer inputs:
Study Category:
Options: Sleep, Stress, Recovery, Cognition, Metabolic Health, Women’s Health, or Other.
Experiment/Product Title:
A participant-facing title describing the study (e.g., “Better Sleep with Magnesium: A Clinical Study”).
Study Objective (Hypothesis):
A hypothesis reflecting the product’s intended effect (e.g., "This supplement improves REM sleep duration").
Customers can select from pre-populated objectives relevant to the product type.
Study Type (Design):
Select between:
Real-World Evidence (Single Arm): All participants use the product.
Randomized Controlled Trial (Two Arm): Half of the participants receive the product, while the other half receives a placebo.
Number of Participants:
Auto-generated based on a power analysis to ensure statistically significant results.
Study Duration:
Duration (in weeks) recommended based on typical timelines for the product category.
Target Metrics (Wearables):
Metrics relevant to the study (e.g., REM Sleep, Deep Sleep, Sleep Efficiency) captured through wearables like Oura Rings.
Validated Questionnaires:
Standardized, validated surveys to collect subjective feedback (e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep studies).
Study Summary:
A one-line summary to describe the study to potential participants (e.g., “We’re studying how magnesium impacts sleep efficiency”).
Participant Instructions:
Detailed, easy-to-follow instructions to ensure participants comply with study requirements (e.g., daily log-in reminders, supplement intake schedules).
Safety and Precautions:
Clear safety guidelines and precautions that participants must acknowledge before starting the study.
Educational Resource Links:
Provide general resources about the product’s category (e.g., scientific studies on nitrate supplementation) to help participants understand the research context.
Important: Exclude direct links to the brand’s website to avoid introducing bias.
Consent Form:
A participant consent form customized to the study, outlining the study’s purpose, risks, and data usage terms.
Custom Other Factors:
Participants can tag life events that may impact study outcomes (e.g., illness, alcohol consumption, travel) to provide context for any deviations.
Eligibility Based on Wearable Data:
Ability to exclude participants based on specific data from wearables (e.g., participants with REM sleep >100 minutes/night can be excluded to target individuals struggling with sleep).
Eligibility Based on Demographics:
Target participants by demographics (e.g., Male, Age 35-50, Living in the US).
Other Eligibility Questions:
Custom questions for participant screening (e.g., "Do you have a history of high blood pressure?").

V2 Requirements: Explanation Layer
In the second version, the AI Study Designer will include an explanation layer for each section of the study protocol. This layer will:
Provide context to explain why certain values were chosen (e.g., “The recommended sample size of 100 participants is based on standard statistical power requirements for sleep studies”).
Educate customers on scientific best practices for study design, helping them gain a deeper understanding of rigorous research.

V3 Requirements: Conversational AI Agent
In future versions, the AI Study Designer will include an interactive conversational agent capable of:
Holding a live conversation (via voice or text) with the customer to answer questions, guide them through the study design process, and provide feedback.
Acting like a virtual research advisor (similar to Boardy.ai), making the interaction intuitive and personalized.
Generating a defensible study protocol by collecting necessary information through a guided conversation.
